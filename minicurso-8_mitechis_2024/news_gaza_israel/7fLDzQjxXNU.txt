WHITE HOUSE UNFORTUNATELY WITH
THEIR TENOR AND TONE FLORIDA
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO IS ACCUSING
PRESIDENT BIDEN OF LEAKING
DETAILS OF HIS CALL WITH ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU TO APPEASE ANTI-ISRAEL
ACTIVISTS.
WATCH THIS.
>> JOE BIDEN AND THE
ADMINISTRATION WOULD LEAK TO THE
MEDIA THE CONTENTS OF A
CONVERSATION WHEN HE TELLS
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU THAT HE
DOESN'T THINK HE SHOULD RESPOND
AT ALL THE CONTINUING PART OF
THIS PUBLIC GAME THAT THEY PLAY
WHICH FRANKLY ENCOURAGES IRAN
AND HEZBOLLAH WHICH WE HAVEN'T
TALKED ABOUT.
MARIA: THIS IS NOT THE FIRST
TIME, TWO WEEKS AGO CHUCK
SCHUMER WAS ON THE SENATE FLOOR
SAYING THAT WE NEED NEW
ELECTIONS IN ISRAEL AND
PRESIDENT BIDEN FOLLOWED UP AND
SAID THAT WAS A GREAT SPEECH TO
CHUCK SCHUMER TO THE MIDDLE OF
THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIVES IN
ISRAEL RIGHT NOW.
>> THAT IS THE ARROGANCE OF THE
ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW
THINKING THAT THEY CAN DICTATE
POLICY TO BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WHO
IS FIGHTING FOR THEIR VERY
SURVIVAL AND SINK INTO EXISTENCE
AND WILL DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR
CHILDREN FOR GENERATIONS TO
COME.
GOOD FOR SENATOR RUBIO FOR
CALLING OUT THE FACT THAT BIDEN
RECORDED A PUBLIC CALL WITH
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU THAT SHOWS
YOU THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETE
DISREGARD FOR THE FACT THAT
THERE ARE MANY OTHER FORCES IN
THE REGION THAT ARE LOOKING FOR
WEAKNESS WHEN IT COMES TO
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU AND THEY
BELIEVE FOR ONE SECOND THAT
BIDEN IN THE UNITED STATES DOES
NOT HAVE ISRAEL'S BACK OUR ALLY
THAT MAKES THINGS WORSE FOR
ISRAEL NOT BETTER.
MARIA: DID YOU SEE THE CROWD
YESTERDAY, DID YOU WOULD ALL GET
EXPOSED TO SOME OF THE
ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS
YESTERDAY.
>> I DID AND ALL THEY ARE DOING
IS TAKING OFF.
>> IT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO WIN
FANS.
MARIA: I THINK PART OF THE
PROBLEM HERE IN THE MAJOR PART
OF THE PROBLEM, PRESIDENT BIDEN
IS ALLOWING DOMESTIC POLICY, BAD
