DANA.
>> Dana: CASEY STIEGEL, THANK 
YOU FOR THE UPDATE.
JOHN.
>> John: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.
ISRAEL'S MILITARY HAS BEEN USING
A.I. THROUGHOUT ITS FIGHT 
AGAINST THE HAMAS TERROR 
ORGANIZATION SPARKING A DEBATE 
OVER THE ETHICS OF USING THE 
TECHNOLOGY IN WARFARE.
DOUGLAS KENNEDY IS HERE NOW WITH
A LOOK AT BOTH SIDES OF THE 
ARGUMENT.
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
>> RECENTLY WE'VE SEEN A.I. 
WRITE TERM PAPERS, ALTER VIDEOS.
NOW IT IS WAGING WAR.
THIS IS A REAL TURNINGPOINT IN 
HISTORY.
>> WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS TYPE OF
ACCELERATION OF TARGETING OF 
SURVEILLANCE.
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE IS ON THE 
BATTLEFIELD IN A MAJOR WAR.
IT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY 
HUMANS FIGHT EACH OTHER, FOR 
BETTER OR WORSE.
MATT IS FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR 
THE STUDY OF WAR AND SPECIALIZES
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND CONFLICTS
OF THE FUTURE.
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HE HAS 
WATCHED ISRAEL PUMP HUGE SUMS OF
MONEY INTO AN A.I. PROGRAM 
CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR ITS 
MILITARY.
SO ISRAEL CALLS THIS FIRE 
FACTORY DESIGNED TO PROCESS HUGE
AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION SO THEY 
CAN ACT MORE QUICKLY AND MORE 
EFFICIENTLY.
>> FIRE FACTORY IS THE 
CENTERPIECE OF THE ISRAELI 
DEFENSE FORCES REVOLUTION ON 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR 
MILITARY OPERATIONS, BRINGING IN
INTELLIGENCE FROM OPEN SOURCE, 
COMMUNICATIONS, SATELLITES, 
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS, FOLKS ON 
THE GROUND, BRINGING IT ALL 
TOGETHER TO MAKE RAPID DECISIONS
IN THE WAR.
>> FIRE FACTORY ANALYZES DATA TO
CHOOSE TARGETS FOR LETHAL 
MUNITIONS.
>> ISRAEL INSISTS ITS COMMANDERS
HAVE FINAL SAY BUT SOME SEE A 
LEAP IN TECHNOLOGY THAT CROSSES 
A LINE HUMANS SHOULD NOT CROSS.
>> LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS 
SHOULD ONLY BE MADE BY HUMANS.
>> MAX IS PRESIDENT OF THE 
FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE WHICH 
OP OPPOSES ALL A.I. IN WEAPONS.
>> THEY LACK CONTEXT AND THE 
HUMAN VALUES THAT HAVE TO GO 
INTO THESE DECISIONS.
>> THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE ETHICAL 
CONUNDRUM.
TODAY WE WATCH ISRAEL.
TOMORROW CHINA.
CHINA HAS BUILT ITS MILITARY 
FUTURE AROUND A.I.
>> XI HAS PUT A.I. AS THE CENTER
POINT OF HIS MODERNIZATION OF 
THE CHINESE MILITARY.
HE WANTS TO BE FASTER, SMARTER 
THAN THE UNITED STATES.
>> AND THE UNITED STATES, HE 
SAYS, MUST PREPARE TO DEFEND 
ITSELF FOR THE A.I. FUTURE.
BACK TO YOU, DANA AND JO
