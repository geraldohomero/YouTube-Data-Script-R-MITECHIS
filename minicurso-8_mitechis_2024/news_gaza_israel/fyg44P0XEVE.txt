there's no more powerful response to the
hatred that spawned 9 11 than the
agreement that we're about to tell you
you will hear something today that's i
think
very very important for not only the
middle east but for the world
in the spirit of peace and cooperation
both leaders also agreed that bahrain
will
fully normalize its diplomatic relations
with israel
they will exchange embassies and
ambassadors begin direct flights between
their countries
and launch cooperation initiatives
across
a broad range of sectors including
health business technology education
security and agriculture this is a truly
historic day
it's a full 26 years from israel's
second peace agreement with an arab
state
to the third peace agreement and now
it's taken us only
29 days from the third peace agreement
to the fourth
what a change i want to express my
appreciation to
his majesty the king of bahrain for
joining the circle of peace
and my appreciation for crown prince
muhammad bin zayed from the united arab
emirates
for working with israel and the united
states to expand the circle of peace
i'm looking forward with enormous
anticipation
to meeting all four countries israel
the united states united arab emirates
and bahrain
in this great historic moment of peace
next tuesday
in washington d.c the bahrain
american-israeli
agreement to normalize relations
is now part of a bigger package in the
region it's not about peace
it's not about relations between
countries we are witnessing
an alliance a military alliance being
created
in the region maybe they want to call it
an arab israel nato
as far as as we as palestinians are
concerned
israel can bring 193 ambassadors
to tel aviv but then what i am
what needs to be solved i am the problem
they are my problem i am what needs to
be solved
and the only way to have peace in this
region is to solve the palestinian
question
is to solve the israeli-palestinian
conflict is to end the israeli
occupation
