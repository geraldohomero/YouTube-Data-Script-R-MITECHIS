And we now directly to Washington
We expand with the journalist José Díaz
Briseño José Biden told Netanyahu that
The United States support to Israel
It will now depend on the measures you take
To defend civilians what else
knows that conversation is losing
Perhaps the patience to
Washington a call that the house
Blanca said lasted around 30
minutes and that was defined as direct
and professional and yet language
which is used in this statement and
Then for the White House when explaining
The contents cannot be more direct
Maybe as they say here in Washington
a kind of ultimatum establishing
just the need to see actions
specific and concrete measurable for
protect humanitarian workers
And also to civilians in gauze you have to
specifically say that the spokesman of the
Lord National Security Council
Kirby does assured that in the call
The
Secretary of State The Vice President
Camala Harris and Security Counselor
National Jake Soliman also must
say that it was specified that it is in
The next hours and days when states
United is waiting for an advertisement
Specific Israel on these measures
Well, you say here in Washington
Patience is lost good
This Thursday conversation between Biden
and Dan Yahu could be one of the most
harsh between the two leaders since
The war began in Gaza 7 months ago
already how pressured is the
President more than 80% of voters
Democrats in an election year have
A bad image of the prime minister
Netanyahu and it's really a pressure
strong inside your own
political coalition that Biden is
carrying to the extreme this morning the
Senator Chris Kun maybe the legislator
More anus to President Biden manifested
directly in favor of establishing
Conditions to aid delivery
military if Israel takes action in Rafa
To ever fight that
Gaza Strip area must be said
also that this adds to others
high -level legislators who have
called to make decisions then
Immediate to eh sanction some
manner hE CONDITIONING MILITARY HELP
If humanitarian aid is not allowed
while the last attack against
World Central Kitchen organization attacked
one of the main characters
Humanitarians here in Washington because
José Andrés is considered and very close
To the Democratic Party here in the capital
Thank you very much José Díaz Briceño
from
Washington
