truth that in politics a long time ago
that I stopped believing in coincidences and
If I abide by the causalities I am going to
link two episodes that happened in the
today come from states
United have to do with the conflict
In the Gaza Strip and especially the role
of Benjamin de Tahu first of them
criticism made by the leader of the
Senate Democrat majority in
United States Chuck Summer that has said
textually what you see there
The Graf that Israeli prime minister
At this time it is an obstacle to
peace in war there in the strip of
Gaza and what does Sammer ask for
Elections that are held elections
that the Israel government changes there is a
additional data not less Chuck Sammer is
The leader of the Democratic Bank of the
Democratic majority in the Senate and is the
First Jew to reach that position for
that their words also have
an additional relevance and says
greater obstacles to peace are
just the actions of Benjamín Nñu
Why do I have another episode I have
In front of my eyes the report of a
American Intelligence Report today
that talks about this specific issue and
Nanju's viability says as a leader
as well as its government coalition of
extreme right and
ultra -orthodox the parties that
They applied hard line policies on
Palestinian and security issues
distrust can be in danger
In Netyahu's ability to
govern has deepened and expanded
between the public from their levels already
high before war and we hope
great protests protests demanding your
resignation and new elections a government
different more moderate is a
Possibility says intelligence
The leader says publicly
of the Democratic majority in the Senate of
The United States Casualities
No
Ah
