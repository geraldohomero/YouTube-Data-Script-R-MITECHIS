SOMETHING THAT ADVANCES THAT
PROSPECT AND SUPPORTS IT, BUT
RIGHT NOW IN THE IMMEDIATE THE
FOCUS IS ON HELPING ISRAEL DEAL
WITH HAMAS.
>> MR. SECRETARY, AS YOU KNOW,
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN
CRITICIZING THE ADMINISTRATION
FOR THE DEAL THAT YOU JUST
STRUCK WITH IRAN TO RELEASE FIVE
AMERICAN DETAINEES IN EXCHANGE
FOR SOME IRANIAN DETAINEES AS
WELL AS RELEASING $6 BILLION.
OFFICIALS SAID IRAN HAS NOT SEEN
A SENT OF THAT MONEY, BUT HOW DO
YOU RESPOND TO REPUBLICAN
CRITICS WHO SAY THAT THAT DEAL
FUNDED THE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL?
>> WELL, IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE
THAT SOME ARE PLAYING POLITICS
AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY LIVES
HAVE BEEN LOST ANDIS RAUL ISRAEL
REMAINS UNDER ATTACKS.
THE FACTS IS THESE ARE NOT
TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND THESE WERE
IRANIAN RESOURCES THAT WERE
STUCK IN A BANK IN SOUTH KOREA.
FROM DAY ONE, IN OUR SANCTIONS
IT'S ALWAYS HAD THE RIGHT TO USE
THE FUNS FOR HUMANITARIAN
PURPOSES, FOR FOOD, MEDICINE AND
EQUIPMENT, AND THE FUNDS WERE
MOVED, BUT UNDER THE CLOSE
SUPERVISION OF THE U.S.
TREASURY --
>> MR. SECRETARY --
>> NO IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET
THESE FACTS RIGHT BECAUSE HERE'S
WHAT'S GOING ON.
AGAIN, NOT A SINGLE CENT HAS
BEEN SPENT FROM THAT ACCOUNT, IT
CAN ONLY BE USED FOR MEDICAL
SUPPLIES, FOR FOOD AND MEDICINE
AND THOSE WHO ARE SAYING
OTHERWISE ARE MISINFORMED AND
MISINFORMING AND IT'S WRONG
EITHER WAY.
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THE
FACT THAT MONEY IS FUNGIBLE.
IRAN MAY HAVE KNOWN THIS MONEY
IS COMING AND MAY HAVE USED
OTHER FUNDS TO HELP FUND THIS
ATTACK THAT HAPPENED.
>> IRAN HAS, UNFORTUNATELY,
ALWAYS USED AND FOCUSED ITS
FUNDS ON SUPPORTING TERRORISM,
ON SUPPORTING GROUPS LIKE HAMAS
AND IT'S DONE THAT WHEN THERE
HAVE BEEN SANCTIONS AND IT'S
DONE THAT WHEN THERE HAVEN'T
BEEN SANCTIONS AND AGAIN I COME
BACK TO THE PROPOSITION THAT
THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED BY
IRAN.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SET UP
