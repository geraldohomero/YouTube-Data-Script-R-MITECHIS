the german government says that russian
opposition leader alexei navalny was
poisoned with a chemical nerve agent
the german chancellor angela merkel says
navalny was the victim of a crime
alexey navalny is obvious
doctors say traces of novichok were
found in samples taken from him
that is the same toxin used in the 2018
attack of a former russian spy
sergei skripal in the uk city of
salisbury
now navalny fell ill on a flight from
siberia to moscow august
20th he was taken to a hospital in
russia
later transferred to berlin
ctv's paul workman says the news out of
germany sets off a political ping-pong
match between the kremlin and european
allies
the germans were quite unequivocal they
said there's no doubt
that novichok was used to poison this
poison of alani this opposition leader
from from
moscow and that now sort of draws a
direct link to
the kremlin or at least a lot of people
will begin to say that
this has this show's kremlin involvement
um
germany for now is talking to its allies
talking to its nato
allies to european allies to figure out
what kind
of response they should they should give
what should they do
now what kind of pressure can they put
on
moscow to find out exactly what happened
to get to the bottom of this
this terrible poisoning they will no
doubt
say that of course they will deny any
direct kremlin involvement and say that
they will want to see
the proof uh from germany just as they
asked for
the proof from the british when they
determined that sergei skripal had been
poisoned with nova chuck
so now i think we'll be getting a
political
discussion between russia and european
allies
who will be putting pressure on on the
russians to try to come up with
the right answers to tell people exactly
what happened to this opposition leader
