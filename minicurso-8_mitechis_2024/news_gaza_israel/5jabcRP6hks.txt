now television has become the vegan
capital of the world that's because 17
of all israelis are thought to be either
vegan vegetarian or flexitarian and
there are over 400 vegan and vegetarian
restaurants in the city alone which is a
mere 20 square miles our correspondent
jody cohen has sent us this report we
leave you with this report from tel aviv
thank you so much for watching we on
world is won
once a cow in the meat industry one day
his leg got stuck in a rock and broke
and he was rescued from slaughter by
freedom farm finding him covered in mud
feces and dirt today he lives happily
with other rescued cows
and it's not just cows who have been
rescued the not-for-profit farm has
rescued hundreds of sheep chickens
rabbits pigs and goats
i spoke with the farm's co-founder adit
romano about how the farm is not just
about rescuing animals it also aims to
educate visitors about compassion
[Music]
we believe that compassion is a muscle
so we exercise this muscle
for the weakest creature in the world
the animals that cannot ask for our
mercies
and people when they come here
and usually they like animals like dogs
and cats discovering that a dog and a
goat and a chicken and a cow and a cat
they are all the same they are all need
our compassion
and they can all be happy or sad
or
frightened or secure
one reason veganism has become so big in
israel is the array of meat-free or
cruelty-free meat innovations which are
being developed in the country
these include for example producing
thousands of real meat steaks from just
a few cells taken from one cow
with cows considered holy in india and
by hindus across the world and with many
non-hindu people turning to meat-free
diets for animal welfare reasons being
able to have your steak and eat it
without hurting even one cow will be
welcome news to many and in the meantime
freedom farm will continue to rescue
animals from slaughter and raise
awareness of the benefits of a more
plant-based diets for people's health
for the environment and for cows like
