Hamas has created a gathering in the gazelle for the last 14 days
Israel's gunpowder is the highest on Gaza
It is raining house house shop
Khandarai is equal to that in gunpowder
Has exploded that reminds Hiroshima
78 years ago August 6
1945 exactly morning
Force at 815 from B29 Bomber
Little Boy Atom Bomb dropped on Hiroshima
This bomb collided with Hiroshima in 43 seconds
4000 kg was 65 kg uranium
Was full
140000 people died in a stroke in it
I am not so havoc but the situation
It is frightening so much so much gunpowder on the gaz
How many bullets were fired, how many missiles were fired
Its report is very scary in 14 days
Israel falls over 6 tonnes of gunpowder on Gaz
8000 bombs have been torn on the gaz
Israel has targeted 4000 locations
11 lakh people have been displaced by gazes
30 percent of the houses of Gaj are destroyed in the bombing
Has been more than 136 health
Centers have been attacked
Hiroshima reminds me of 23 lakhs of Gaj
10 lakh people from population electricity water and
The paths are craving for grains
100 trucks filled with material Egypt
Standing at the crossing first of air strikes
Egypt jammed trucks by citing
Was done by doing Egypt from Rafa crossing
The trucks were not giving entry into the gaz
However, in the meantime Rawa crossing opened
Gone and 20 trucks with relief material
They have also left for
Is it that it is a cross crossing
Let us also know the cross -cross -kossing gaza
A border crossing to the south of the bandage
Is between Israel and Egyptian crossing
Entry Point This is a cross crossing but
Entry gate of Rafa Crossing towards Egypt
Egypt has to open this crossing
Rafa crossing Gaza Strip is right
Egypt's Sinai connects to the desert
Another border adjacent to Gaza Strip is Carrom
The use of Shilaum Carrom Philanum of Business

Both border is constantly closed by Miss
Sending 20 trucks standing at the crossing
Now he has agreed and medicine in these trucks
And there is essential items after which now Gaj
Hope to reach great relief
