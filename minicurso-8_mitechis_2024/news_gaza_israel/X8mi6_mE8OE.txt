HUNDREDS OF MILES.
WE'RE LEARNING NEW AND HARROWING

>> THE IDF SAYS THROUGH AN AIR 
STRIKE IN THE WEST BANK IT 
TARGETED AND KILLED A TOP SPLINE
MILITANT WHO TRIED TO PLAN 
ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS IN 
JERUSALEM.
AS FAR AS THE LATEST STAGE OF 
THE WAR IN GAZA ISRAEL'S DEFENSE
MINISTER SAID THE MANEUVERING IN
THE NORTH BUT THERE IS SOME 
FIGHTING IN THE NORTH.
THE FOCUS IS SHIFTING TO THE 
CENTRAL PART OF GAZA, AREAS 
WHERE TODAY THE IDF UNCOVERED A 
NEW SYSTEM OF TUNNELS.
THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID THE 
FIGHTING IN THE SOUTH WILL SOON 
START TO WIND DOWN.
GIVING NO WORD ON THE TIMING ON 
THAT.
THAT IS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF 
THE NEARLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE WHO 
ARE DISPLACED HAVE FLED.

ITS STAFFERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN
GAZA SINCE THE START OF THE WAR.

ONE OF THE FREED HOSTAGES WHO 
RETURNED TO HER HOME WHERE SHE 
HID WITH HER HUSBAND AND TWIN 
3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTERS ON 
OCTOBER 7TH.
HAMAS MILITANTS SET THEIR HOUSE

HOME AND BURN ALIVE OR CLIMB OUT
OF THE WINDOW AND GET SHOT.
THE FAMILY CHOSE THE LATTER.
INSTEAD OF BEING KILLED, THEY 
WERE TAKEN CAPTIVE INTO GAZA.
THE WOMAN AND GIRLS ARE FREED 
BUT HER HUSBAND IS STILL 
CAPTIVE.
>> IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE YOU 
ARE HEARING THIS, MY LOVE, I 
WILL DO THE BEST I CAN.
YOU ARE COMING HOME, I PROMISE 
YOU THAT.
>> FRANCE AND QATAR HAVE 
BROKERED A DEAL TO SEND IN 
MEDICATION THAT THE HOSTAGES 
REMAINING IN GAZA SO DESPERATELY
NEED.
45 OF THE MORE THAN 100 HOSTAGES
HAVE CHRONIC ILLNESS ANDED IN 
THE MEDICATIONS.
I TALKED WITH A DOCTOR IN TEL 
AVIV WHO SAID DESPITE IT BEING A
HOPEFUL MOMENT THAT THE HOSTAGES
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THE 
MEDICATION, THEY HAVE STILL BEEN
