and welcome our top focus at this hour
is the Israel Hamas War the United
States Security Council has voted to
approve a resolution that demands to
allow more Aid deliveries to Gaza
however the much anticipated resolution
that comes after days of delay falls
short of calling for a
ceasefire this is after the fighting has
further intensified in the Gaza Strip in
the last 24 hours the 15 member United
Nations security Council 13 voted in
favor of the resolution
two abstained including the US which has
been negotiating the language of the
draft so that it does not veto it Israel
has said it will continue to inspect the
aid heading into Gaza for security
reasons on the other hand Hamas has
called the resolution insufficient at
the moment meanwhile the United Nations
Chief has alleged that the real problem
hampering humanitarian efforts in Gaza
is the way Israel conducts its
offensive ahead of the vote Israel
military said that it is preparing to
widen the operation in Gaza with an
emphasis on the southern
area over in the north the IDF says it
is gradually completing the
goals as we get closer to the final
stages of the operation being held in
the north we are still in the middle of
fighting in the DAR and tufa area with
lower intensity fighting Cell going on
in other areas of the north we are in
full operational control
the IDF says it struck Hamas
headquarters and eliminated militants in
southern Gaza City in the last 24 hours
it also claims to have located a number
of shafts leading to a significant
underground tunnel route with the help
of its K9
unit Israel claims this route was used
as an underground Base by Hamas it is
all alleged to have been used for
storage hideouts command and control and
movement of militants between different
areas the cost of the war is also
increasing death of a 73-year-old US
Israeli hostage guard hagay has been
announced by his kibot

in Gaza but was actually killed on the
day of the attack the community sa
