>> Dana: FOX TEAM COVERAGE 
JACQUE HEINRICH AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
NATE FOYE IS LIVE IN NORTHERN 
ISRAEL.
>> GOOD MORNING.
BREAKING JUST IN THE PAST FEW 
MINUTES WE'RE LEARNING FROM THE 
IDF THAT THE RED CROSS HAS IN 
ITS CARE TWO ISRAELI HOSTAGES 
AHEAD OF AN EXPECTED LARGER 
HOSTAGE RELEASE LATER TONIGHT.
WE'RE LEARNING THAT ONE OF THOSE
TWO HOSTAGES IS A 21-YEAR-OLD 
WOMAN ON THEIR WAY TO ISRAEL 
RIGHT NOW.
MORE HOSTAGES EXPECTED LATER.
THIS COMES JUST HOURS AFTER A 
HAMAS TERRORIST ATTACK IN 
JERUSALEM THAT KILLED THREE 
PEOPLE THIS MORNING.
WE'LL SHOW YOU WHAT WE CAN FROM 
THAT ATTACK.
I WARN YOU, IT IS VERY 
DISTURBING.
TAKE A LOOK YOU SEE THE 
TERRORISTS GET OUT OF THEIR CAR 
IN JERUSALEM AT A BUS STOP AND 
OPEN FIRE.
WE STOPPED THE VIDEO BEFORE THEY
ACTUALLY STARTED SHOOTING.
THEY KILLED TWO WOMEN, ONE MAN.
THEY SENT SEVERAL OTHERS TO THE 
HOSPITAL.
RESERVISTS SHOT AND KILLED THE 
TWO TERRORISTS WHO WERE 
BROTHERS.
DURING A MEETING WITH U.S. 
SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN THIS 
MORNING ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER 
NETANYAHU SAID ISRAEL WILL STOP 
AT NOTHING TO GET RID OF HAMAS.
>> THIS PROCESS IS PRODUCING 
RESULTS, IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE 
HOPE THAT IT CAN CONTINUE.
AT THE SAME TIME I LOOK FORWARD 
TO DETAILED CONVERSATIONS WITH 
THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL ABOUT 
THE WAY AHEAD IN GAZA.
>> 49-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN ISRAELI 
LEON IS WAKING UP IN ISRAEL 
TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
OCTOBER 7TH.
THE MOTHER OF THREE WAS 
KIDNAPPED FROM HER KIBBUTZ WITH 
HER HUSBAND, WHO REMAINS IN 
HAMAS CAPTIVITY, ALONG WITH AT 
LEAST SEVEN AMERICANS.
THREE PALESTINIAN PRISONERS FOR 
EVERY ISRAELI HOSTAGE ARE 
RETURNING HOME AS WELL.
LAST NIGHT ANOTHER 30 
PALESTINIANS REUNITED WITH THEIR
FAMILIES.
YOU SEE THAT HERE.
NOW AS FOR THE HOSTAGES THAT ARE
SET TO BE RELEASED LATER TODAY, 
THE PARENTS OF A 17 AND 
18-YEAR-OLD SISTER AND BROTHER 
CONFIRMED THAT THEIR CHILDREN 
ARE ON THAT LIST AND THIS IS AS 
TWO HOSTAGES ARE ALREADY COMING 
BACK TO ISRAEL, BUT MIA IS ONE 
OF THEM.
THAT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE TWO 
CHILDREN.
WE'LL KEEP WORKING TO LEARN MORE
