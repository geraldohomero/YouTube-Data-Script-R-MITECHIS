now the hunt for those violent
extremists who stormed their way into
the u.s capitol building is still going
on
it's been more than 100 days since the
attack on the seat of american democracy
five people were killed and as ctv's
washington bureau chief joy melbourne
reports the justice department
is zeroing in on hundreds of culprits
[Music]
from the terrifying to the bizarre
the capitol hill rioters are being
rounded up arrested
and charged the latest robert chapman of
new york
who bragged about his involvement on a
dating app
boasting i did storm the capitol i made
it all the way into statutory hall
the woman was clearly not impressed we
are not a match she wrote
i suppose not he replied not a match but
she did tip
off authorities the fbi is on a
nationwide manhunt
asking the public's help in identifying
10 of the most violent offenders at the
capitol riot
these individuals are responsible for
assaults on law enforcement officers
who are protecting the capital in our
democratic process on january 6.
releasing these disturbing videos of
officers
being punched beaten with sticks and
flag poles
sprayed with a fire extinguisher and
unknown chemical agents
more than 50 of those arrested are
military or come from law enforcement
others connected to extremist groups
like heavy metal guitarist john schaefer
the first to plead guilty
a founding member of the oath keepers
militia group he's expected to cooperate
this is a typical way for federal
prosecutors to build a case often by
flipping them or getting them to
cooperate against one another
trump supporters tried to disrupt the
certification of joe biden's election
and so far the department of justice
says more than 400 people have been
charged
and expect to charge another 100 in the
coming days
democrats pushing for a 9 11 type
commission to
investigate the attack so far lawmakers
can't agree
it's not about reviewing the elections
it's not about examining
black lives matter it's about what
happened
on january 6th and how we can prevent it
from happening again
president biden will deliver his first
address to congress next
wednesday in a capital that is still
surrounded by fencing
and patrolled by the national guard
