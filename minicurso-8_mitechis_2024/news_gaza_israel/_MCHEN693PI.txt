Obviously one of the most
Important this weekend Andrés
It has to do with war in Israel is
extremely sad what we were
sharing in the last hours not
Regarding deaths and victims
After this terrorist attack yes from
fact must take into account a bit
Context a few days ago recently
We talked the topic of conversation of what
What happened in Israel was the
controversial judicial reform by
of the Netanyahu Minister but this time
Israel's prime minister states that
Your country is embarking on a war
long and difficult and is imposed by the
Palestinian movement ever this
Saturday carried out an attack without
precedents with Israeli territory that
Together with the Israeli military response
has caused hundreds of dead
We talk about surprising shots to everything
the one who walked on good street
I expected the word by the first
Minister and this Sunday through his
Social networks pointed out Netan Yahu
So that this war has been
imposed by a murderous attack of the group
Terrorist ever the first phase phase phase
War well I say that it was a bit what
Benjamín Netanyahu wrote implies
destroy most forces
enemies that have been infiltrated in Israel
and have killed civilians and soldiers
It was what he pointed out, let's not remember that
Israel also initiated an offensive in
Gaza and will continue without hesitation and
No truce until the
objectives yes in a speech that was
Netan televised whom we observe there
on his screen because he said that the
His country will use his whole
Power to destroy ever and urged
The Palestinians to leave the strip of
Gaza warning that it will reduce to
rubble the hiding places of the
Good militiamen also stressed the
We will destroy and avenge strongly
This dark day that has imposed on
State of Israel and its citizens
Israel's Prime Minister in this way
He called the inhabitants of Gaza to evacuate
The strip before the imminent offensive
We add that there are more than 600
Israeli citizens who have died like
consequence of this
stroke
