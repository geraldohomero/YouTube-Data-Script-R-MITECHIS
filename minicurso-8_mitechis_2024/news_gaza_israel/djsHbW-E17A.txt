very good is a very hard blow
First blow to diplomacy
International in the Middle East after
years and years and years of work of
United States of Joe Biden Arabia Saudi
He has just announced that he stops all
diplomacy that was getting into
march for years to normalize the
Relationship with Israel after
bursting of violence after what
It happened last Saturday Arabia Saud√≠ da
A step back after everything achieved
by the different administrations
Americans and break all kinds of
Diplomacy with Israel is a hard blow to
The ambitions especially by Joe Biden
For the Middle East is a great blow to
all diplomacy and now it is understood
better because
Blinken that Minister of Affairs
United States exterior
had expanded the amount of time that
I was going to use in the Middle East to
talk to negotiate for diplomacy and
is that behind the entire movement of
The last days was the perspective
that Saudi Arabia broke
Definitely everything walked
anticipated everything moved everything
given in recent years between Arabia
Saudi Israel and the United States breaks
Diplomacy between Saudi and
Israel and that is a hard blow especially
For the stability of the Middle East such
And as Joe Biden had raised
The United States will see from
now what is the next movement
because that pausar diplomacy that
I was normalizing ties with Israel
It is above all a hard blow to Joe
They biden that now you will have to work
much more in diplomacy in
Middle East if you want to reconstitute if
wants to recover what somewhere
had achieved in recent times
And above all leave a path open to
China important to become that
fundamental actor in the Middle East that
United States wanted him to be
It was drove that it was the United States
Who could put in front
