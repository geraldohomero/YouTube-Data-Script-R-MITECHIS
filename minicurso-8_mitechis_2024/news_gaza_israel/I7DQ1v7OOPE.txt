The United States unlocks and was the case
UN Security Council so that
for the first time a stop at
Immediate fire in Gaza minutes later
claimed that the resolution was not
binding the same thing repeated from the
Home
Blanca the rest contradicts them is or not
It is binding there is a large majority
overwhelming of theorists and jurists who
has always said and repeated that all
The Decisions of the Security Council
The Secretary General are mandatory
of the UN urgently implement it but the
United Nations Power is limited
Remember Thomas Whs experts about the
UN There is no international force
of a policeman who will be mandatory

illegal settlements in
occupied Palestinian territories but more
beyond the legal weight of this
Fire high resolution

Exerts the international community on
peace negotiations and one more key
Washington has pressed one of the buttons
Red to raise the shield with which
It usually shields Israel in the Council
We will see if it is still the exception
Because he denies having changed posture
Well, if relationships were tense
Between Biden and Netanyahu the abstention of
yesterday from the United States in the Council of
UN security have made that
Gap is big even more and complicates
also more the situation of the own
Netanyahu here in Israel the first
Minister not only faces the
international pressure but also to
Differences with your own government today
The meeting has been canceled for that reason
of the cabinet and today we have also known
by independent survey that 2% of
The Israelis already support the first
Minister while conversations
To achieve a possible truce
They stagnate the Israeli delegation that
He negotiated in Doja has returned with the
empty hands Israel and never follow
holding up the lack of advances
