in near constant communication with our
Israeli partners and partners all across
the region and the world from the moment

additional military systems including
ammunition and interceptors to replenish
Iron
Dome we're going to make sure that
Israel does not run out of these
critical assets to defend its cities and
its
citizens my Administration has consulted
closely with Congress throughout this
crisis when Congress returns we're going
to ask them to take urgent action to
fund the National Security requirements

partners this is not about party or
politics this about the security of our
world the security of the United States
