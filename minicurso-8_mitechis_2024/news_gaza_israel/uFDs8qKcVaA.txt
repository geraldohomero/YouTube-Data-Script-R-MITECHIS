 
TO YOU, WHIT.
WELL, THE SITUATION IS VOLATILE
AND IS CHANGING QUITE QUICKLY.
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW.
THE PALESTINIAN MILITANT GROUP 
HAMAS HAS LAUNCHED A MASSIVE 
UNPRECEDENTED MILITARY OPERATION
FROM THE AIR AND SAY THEY FIRED 
MORE THAN 5,000 ROCKETS AND 
LONG-RANGE MISSILES, SOME OF 
THEM SLAMMING INTO CITIES IN 
SOUTHERN ISRAEL, AND YOU CAN SEE
THICK, BLACK PLUMES OF SMOKE IN 
THE AIR.
RESIDENTS TRYING TO TAKE SHELTER
WHEREVER THEY CAN.
FROM THE GROUND IMAGES SHOWING 
DOZENS OF HEAVILY ARMED 
PALESTINIANS ON MOTORBIKES AND 
ALSO IN PICKUP TRUCKS 
INFILTRATING ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS
NEAR THE BORDER, ALSO CUTTING 
THROUGH THE BORDER FENCE AND 
SHOOTING AT PASSERS-BY KILLING 
AT LEAST 22 ISRAELIS AND 
INJURING HUNDREDS OF OTHERS.
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING DISTURBING 
REPORTS THAT HAMAS HAS TAKEN AT 
LEAST 35 ISRAELIS INCLUDING 
SOLDIERS AND HOLDING THEM 
HOSTAGE.
THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TELLING THE 
COUNTRY, WE ARE AT WAR, AND WE 
WILL WIN.
HAMAS' SPOKESPERSON CALLING ON 
ALL PALESTINIANS TO TAKE UP ARMS
AND FIGHT.
JANAI?
>> Janai: AND, LAMA, YOU'VE
BEEN COVERING IT EXTENSIVELY AND
SAID AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR THAT
THIS IS LIKELY EXTENSIVELY 
PLANNED AND COULD BE SEEN AS A 
SECURITY FAILURE BY ISRAEL.
HOW ARE PEOPLE REACTING THERE 
RIGHT NOW?
>> Reporter: YEAH, YOU KNOW, 
JANAI, PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED
THAT HAMAS MILITANTS, WHO COME 
FROM ONE OF THE POOREST AREAS IN
THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES FROM
GAZA, WHICH HAS BEEN UNDER SIEGE
FOR DECADES, THAT THEY THEY HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS SORT
OF MILITARY OPERATION.
THEY ARE SHOCKED BY THE SCALE 
AND ALSO THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY
HAVE INFILTRATED THE BORDER 
GOING INTO ISRAELI TOWNS AND 
FROM TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE 
GROUND, PALESTINIANS ARE 
CELEBRATING AND FEEL THEY ARE 
EMBOLDENED, THAT THEY'VE BEEN 
ABLE TO ATTACK ISRAEL AND FEEL 
THAT THERE IS A SHIFT HERE, THAT
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF CHANGE.
THEY SAY THAT THIS IS A DIRECT 
RESULT OF THE ATTACKS AND THE 
WAY PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN 
TREATED, WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS
ISRAELI AGGRESSION AND AFTER
