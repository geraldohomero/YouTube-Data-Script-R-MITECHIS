BY NEGLIGENCE BY CANADIAN
JASMINE HARTIN FROM KINGSTON,
ONTARIO AFTER ADMITTING SHE SHOT
AND KILLED A BELIZE POLICE
CHIEF.
>> I WANT THE FAMILY TO HAVE
PEACE AND I WANT THE WHOLE THING
BEHIND ALL OF US SO WE CAN HEAL.
>> TAKING ALL THINGS INTO
CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY HEAVY
ON HEART CONSIDERING NOT PUT THE
FAMILY OF THE VICTIM THROUGH
ANGUISH OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH
A TRIAL PROCEEDING.

FACTOR.

JUDGE MAY CONSIDER A
NONCUSTODIAL SENTENCE WITH
HARTIN ORDERED TO PAY A LARGE
FINE OR COMPENSATION TO THE
FAMILY.

SITUATION LIKE THIS.
THE ONLY THING THAT CAN HAPPEN
IS PARTIES INVOLVED CAN NOW GET
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE ON WITH
THEIR LIVES.
