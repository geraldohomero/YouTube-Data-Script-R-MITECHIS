UM Han Algul found refuge in a
school managed by the UN near
The border with
Egypt the first day of the war we saw
missiles passing over our
Heads Our neighborhood is dangerous is
On the side or this we were afraid of
stay at home God knows how we go out
but
We escape our situation is very hard
This is not a solution children
The agency of
UN for Palestine refugees
You can't offer us anything this is ours
Fourth day at school I have the
high tension and diabetes and I can't

Thousands of people have fled the majority
But not all before their homes and
neighborhoods will be reduced to debris

Psychological but its number increases
The ability of a roa is greatly
For 150,000 displaced and there is also a
Great financial problem to attend
All these people also lack
appropriate personnel to help

UN displaced centers
Israel's total siege on the strip
of gauze has cut the supply of
Water Food Medicine and
Electricity we lived in a safe place
The war broke out the attack came without
prior notice and we had to leave
We walk about 7 kmos until we get here
hoping to find a place
Sure but not the way there is no water
nor food the sewer network is

They hope a thirst will pass
