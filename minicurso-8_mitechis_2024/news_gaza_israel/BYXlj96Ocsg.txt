NEGOTIATIONS.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TURN TO CTV'S
PAUL WORKMAN IN UKRAINE FOR US
IN LVIV.
AT THE LOW TO YOU, PAUL.
RUSSIA -- HELLO TO YOU, PAUL.
RUSSIAN AND UKRAINE ALLOWING
SAFE PASSAGE OPTION TOPPING THE
AGENDA BUT THAT PLAN IS NOT
HOLDING AS RUSSIA CONTINUES TO
TARGET AND BOMBARD CIVILIANS.
>> Reporter: HI, MARCIA, GOOD
MORNING.
YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS WAS GOING
TO PLAY OUT.
WHEN RUSSIA IMMEDIATELY SAID
THIS WANTED TO LARGELY FUNNEL
PEOPLE FROM UKRAINE TOWARDS
BELARUS AND TOWARDS RUSSIA
ITSELF THAT THE UKRAINIAN
GOVERNMENT WOULD SAY THIS IS
UNWORKABLE.
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
UKRAINE SAID PEOPLE SHOULD BE
ABLE TO GO TO THE WESTERN PART

WHAT'S THE LATEST?
>> Reporter: WELL, CERTAINLY
TO THE NORTH IT DOESN'T LOOK AS
IF THAT MASSIVE CONVOY IS MOVING
ANYWHERE.
ANALYSTS THINK IT'S STUCK IN THE
MUD AND MAY BE PRACTICALLY
USELESS; HOWEVER, THERE IS A
MASSING OF RUSSIAN TROOPS ON THE
WESTERN SIDES, THE NORTHWESTERN
SIDE COMING TOWARDS KYIV IN THE
MIDDLE AND COMING FROM THE EAST
AS WELL.
THAT WOULD BE -- ALLOW THEM TO
ENCIRCLE KYIV IF THEY POSSIBLY
CAN IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH FORCES
TO DO THAT.
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE GAME PLAN
