There was a lot of difference in me, see sir
If you are able to explain, I will tell you one thing
Which is the area of Gaja, it meets Egypt
It has happened and all this desert inside Egypt
These people are here many ways here
Can be here, but they have ever emerged
Acomodeative ment is also facing there
Shabab and Brotherhood which is their organization
Which is their territory organization there
She is the people of Gaza who are people of Hamas
Those people coordinate with them
Misar Government will never want to gaze
People came here now this is Israel South
Gaza is attached here from here
But he does not want to come here
It is going that their people come here inside it
This thing is different, this desert area is different
Porusion which is all desert here
But they can definitely come but Israel him
Those who are coming out of South Israel
Somewhere around the military camp in the border
Those who leave from here are being kept
There are displaced people for Israel
What is the challenge, this challenge is the biggest
It has been that if it goes inside it
All will be attacked again by attacking
Can miss this land above them and here
This land of this land which is land
It can also be missed by us
Today is a supporter and there can be attacks from here too
There is a lot of fears from Egypt than Hai Faga
Is that even supporters of Hamas attack from here
Can be on Israel because people constantly
South Gaz is going from North Gaz
Thank you very much sir
