Yes, look,
the situation in the Red Sea began with a distress call from a cargo ship there.
Us navy choppers responding at that point.
They say they were fired on by Houthi
rebels and return that fire sinking three ships,
killing 10 men on board those ships.
It's the first response we've seen from us troops that have ended with a fatality
that certainly ramps up the situation which has
been escalating over the last month or so.
Us troops have been fired on from
organizations in Yemen in the Red Sea and surrounding areas.
So a lot of concern there while Israeli troops continue
to gather along the border with Lebanon, more troops moving in more equipment,
tanks and
other equipment there and that's a continuous back and forth.
So not only here in Israel but globally,
there is a big concern that this could ultimately become another front in this war.
All of that while the ongoing war in Gaza continues
with a lot of focus right now in the Ho
Yis area,
we know that it is a densely populated urban area.
The fighting has been very intense.
The IDF says that they believe Hamas leadership is hiding
in that area.
And so they're really focused on trying to find all
of that while they continue with airstrikes as well.
They do say that they've eliminated a lot of the command and control structures,
a lot of the
military facilities including some of the missile launch sites.
And they say that they are continuing to find
and eliminate tunnels in that region as well.
And what leadership here in Tel Aviv and military leaders on the ground in Gaza are
saying is that this is a process that's going to continue months into the New Year.
That's the latest from here in Tel Aviv. I'm Jay Gray. Back to you.
