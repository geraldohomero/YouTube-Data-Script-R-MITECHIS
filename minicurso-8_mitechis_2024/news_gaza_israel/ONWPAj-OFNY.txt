lebanon and israel have contested their
land and maritime borders for
decades including an area on the edge of
three lebanese offshore energy blocks in
2018 lebanon signed its first
contract for offshore drilling in two
blocks in the mediterranean for oil and
gas with a consortium
comprising of energy giants
while the initial drilling in block 4
had shown traces of gas but no
commercially viable reserves were
detected exploration of block 9 has not
started
and is far more controversial because of
disputed ownership
resolving the dispute would be a
significant political achievement and
could
mitigate risk for energy companies
looking to drill
in a volatile region
