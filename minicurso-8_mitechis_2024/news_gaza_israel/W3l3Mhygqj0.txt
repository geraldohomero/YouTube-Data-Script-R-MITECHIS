A video completed from Dagistan, Russia
This video is becoming viral in the world
It is visible that thousands of runways
But people descended to a plane from Israel
Claims that the crowd is surrounded
Most of the Muslims were Makha Sh Kali
By attacking the airport and breaking security
Had entered inside and was on their target
Jewish Israel's Gaza Strip from Israel
Angry crowds came on the plane
Jews used to harm
Not only on the runway but from the airport
Each of every car out
Riot crowd passport after stopping cars
Started asking for the people of Israel
Tax can be damaged by about one
This was the same for one and a half hours
Dagistan Police and Russian Central Police
Handed up and broke on rioters
The wind of rioters came out as soon as police action
Many arrested on violent mob
Hardly controlled with great effort
After the er report was opened back now here
The question arises that Russia's stains suddenly
Why is Israel Hamas Sleep due to war
Gaya to understand this, the population of this area and
It is necessary to know history first
Tell you where it is in Russia
Give it to the western shore of SPM Sagar
Situated on Northern Cox, this state is located
Georgia Chechnya on one side and on the other side
Azerbaijan is adjacent to and the population here
It is about 31 lakhs first it comes in Chechnya
Was later made a separate Republic
Most of the population in this area Sunni
Muslims belong to and it is also the area that
Russia is plagued by Russia
The only part is where more than 30 languages
Moscow is spoken in 2010
There was a suicide attack at the metro station
Dagini extremists had a hard hand
Apart from this, many extremists here in Russia
This is the reason for the terrorist attack
Israel is from religious in Hamas war
A big group suddenly turned into a riot congestion
And broke on the aircraft from Israel
Although Russian President Putin's interference
After the blockade has been blocked in the entire area
But the big question is about the storm of hate
The population here provokes to revolt
Stayed
