We find our correspondent for
Jerusalem Stéphane Amar Stéphane Hello
fights and stiffness therefore have a
again intense this night yes
absolutely as you said
mainly around hospitals
Gaza and de Ranunz which are according to the army
Israeli of the bastions of the combatants
of Hamas who would be refugeed from the
Departure of the operation in October
but also in recent weeks of
several groups of combatants at
times Hamas but also jihad
Islamic would have returned to its
hospitals to find shelter where also
There are many weapons caches
still according to the Israeli army which has
interviewed it was broadcast at the
Israeli television of combatants
Palestinians captured in these hospitals
who actually testified that he
found and well uh many centers
neuralgic fighter movements
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip
must know indeed that
Israeli infantry is sustained
systematically by aviation which
explains the extremely high number of
bombings that continue in the
Gaza strip there was also this
Mohamed Dif audio message
commander -in -chief of the armed branch
Hamas do we know a little
more then what we know is that
Moedev who is therefore considered to be the
Number 2 of Hamas in the Gaza Strip
After Ir Sino Noir while number 3
would have been eliminated according to
the Israeli army and well Mohameddev
considered the great architect of
the infrastructure of the armal in the band
of Gaza it would be expressed
and he would have highlighted the cause of
Jerusalem The cause of the Alaxa mosque
He called all the Arab countries all
Arabs all Muslims in the world to
Solidize with the Palestinians
To defend the mosque inAxa it is necessary
understand that from the start of
this operation from the massacres of 7
October and Hamas highlighted
The cause of Alaxa the cause of the mosque
of Jerusalem where I am because
This cause is considered
extremely unifying for the world
Arab and for the Muslim world in
general but for the moment you know
that Ramadan started we had very
fear here in Jerusalem and although the
situation ignites for the moment here
The situation is calm around the
Mosque in Laxa Thank you Famar you in
Direct from Jerusalem
