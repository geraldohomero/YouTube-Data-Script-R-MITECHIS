>>> A SENIOR ARAB OFFICIAL WITH
DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF NEGOTIATIONS
CONFIRMS TO NBC'S RICHARD ENGEL
THAT A TRUCE EXTENSION WILL
HAPPEN.
LET'S BRING IN NBC NEWS FOREIGN
CORRESPONDENT RAF SANCHEZ BACK
WITH US IN TEL AVIV.
RAF, WHAT ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT
THE FINALIZATION OF SOME KIND OF
DEAL?
>> Reporter: SO, ANA, WE'VE
KNOWN FOR DAYS THAT BOTH SIDES
WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS AS A
POSSIBILITY.
WE HEARD PRESIDENT BIDEN
YESTERDAY EXPRESSING OPTIMISM
THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN.
HAMAS SAYING THEY WERE OPEN TO
IT.
ISRAELIS SAYING THEY WERE OPEN
TO IT.
NOW THIS SENIOR ARAB OFFICIAL
WITH DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE
TALKS SAYS A TENTATIVE AGREEMENT
HAS BEEN REACHED TO EXTEND THIS
FOUR-DAY CEASE-FIRE UNDER THAT
PRE-AGREED FORMULA.
THAT IS ONE ADDITIONAL DAY OF
CEASE-FIRE IN EXCHANGE FOR TEN
ADDITIONAL HOSTAGES.
AS OF NOW, THE CEASE-FIRE WAS
SUPPOSED TO END GOING INTO
TOMORROW.
SO IT DOES APPEAR LIKE WE'RE
LOOKING AT LEAST TUESDAY WILL BE
ANOTHER DAY OF QUIET INSIDE
GAZA, ASSUMING THIS AGREEMENT IS
FINALIZED AND ASSUMING THAT
NOBODY BREAKS THE CEASE-FIRE
WHICH SO FAR HAS NOT HAPPENED.
THIS CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN
STRAINED, BUT IT HAS NOT BROKEN.
THAT WILL BE ENORMOUSLY WELCOME
NEWS FROM THE FAMILIES OF
HOSTAGES HERE IN ISRAEL WHO HAVE
NOT YET HAD THEIR LOVED ONES
BACK.
WE KNOW THERE ARE AROUND 40, 50
WOMEN, CHILDREN, WHO FIT THE
CRITERIA FOR THIS DEAL BUT HAVE
NOT YET BEEN RELEASED.
IT WILL ALSO BE AN ENORMOUS
RELIEF FOR PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS
INSIDE GAZA WHO HAVE HAD THESE
THREE DAYS OF CAM AFTER 49 DAYS
OF ISRAELI BOMBARDMENT IN
RESPONSE TO THE HAMAS OCTOBER
7th TERROR ATTACK.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET
ACCESS TO THAT HUMANITARIAN AID
WHICH HAS BEEN COMING IN TO
GAZA, AROUND 200 TRUCKS EVERY
DAY.
THAT'S STILL A FRACTION OF WHAT
CIVILIANS INSIDE GAZA NEED, BUT
IT'S MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT
WAS COMING BEFORE.
ONE OF THE BIG SOURCES OF
TENSION THROUGHOUT THESE PAST
FOUR DAYS OF CEASE-FIRE AND
LIKELY IN ANY COMING DAYS OF
CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN WHETHER OR
