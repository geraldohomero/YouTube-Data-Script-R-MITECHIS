Israel from October 7 between Palestine
Palestine's life and goods in the ongoing war
Israel suffered heavy losses
Along with killing many of Hamas's fighters
Thousands of innocent civilians women and
Children were also killed by this
Even after Israel and America are supporting it
No major success in this war so far
Not found
The second thing is that towards Israel
Palestine and in the attacks to be done
On being killed by common citizens of Gaza
America and Israel with their countries
Protests are also taking place in other countries and
Israel also in International Court of Israel
Male Sanghar case is going on against
If you say Bow clearly, Israel was involved in this war
Protests are facing a tough challenge and
Due to challenges, Israel from his
Soldiers also started removing
Let me tell you that Israel in this war
Even though there is success in air strikes
But he has no major success on the ground
Israel of big leaders of Hamas
Nothing spoiled

Was Val Street General an American officer
Quoted as saying that 5000 to 9000 dead
Apart from terrorists, 10000 to 11000 Hamas
He is injured in fighting
Many of these injured fighters wars
Can return in
He is more responsible for fighters
Playing the responsibility of at least two to three fighters
are
There is a big thing that has also come out
That Hamas attacked Israel for months
The firepower to do is intact on the other side
Hamas also established his police again
Is engaged in doing it, Israel also
The path is not very easy for perhaps
Understanding the matter, Israel and America now
Accepting your failure your steps
Slowly pulling back from war
Are
