HAVE FULL CONTROL OF A NOW
NON-OPERATIONAL CHILDREN'S
HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN GAZA.
IT CLOSED LAST THURSDAY.
TODAY, THE IDF IS INSISTING
HAMAS WAS USING THE COMPLEX TO
HIDE HOSTAGES, EVEN RELEASING
FOOTAGE THEY CLAIM SHOWS WHERE
SOME WERE BEING HELD.
MEDICAL PERSONNEL FROM
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS,
PALESTINIAN AMERICAN GROUPS AND
OTHERS, AND U.S. GROUPS, REFUTE
THAT CLAIM AND SAY THEY HAVE
NEVER SEEN HAMAS ACTIVITY AT
THEIR HOSPITAL.
THE FACILITY WAS THE ONLY ONE IN
GAZA SPECIALIZING IN TREATING
CHILDREN WITH CANCER.
MANY YOUNG PATIENTS HAD BEEN CUT
OFF FROM CHEMOTHERAPY FOR MORE
THAN A MONTH SINCE THE WAR
STARTED.
UNTIL THE WHITE HOUSE,
PALESTINIAN CANCER ADVOCATES,
AND ST. JUDE'S HOSPITAL FOR
CHILDREN STEPPED IN.
VICTORY AT LAST FOR THIS
10-YEAR-OLD, ONE OF 21
PALESTINIAN CHILDREN WITH
CANCER.
SAFE IN AN EGYPTIAN HOSPITAL,
FLASHING A SIGN OF VICTORY.
THE CHILDREN WITH PARENTS OR
GUARDIANS AT THE CENTER OF A
SECRET INTERNATIONAL MISSION
SINCE THE WAR BEGAN TO RESCUE
THEM FROM GAZA.
THEIR JOY TEMPERED BY REALITY.
SHE SAYS, I WOULD LIE IF I SAID
I WAS OPTIMISTIC AND MY FAMILY
IS STILL IN GAZA.
I'M AFRAID FOR THEM AND OUR
HOUSE HAS BEEN HIT.
THEY CAME TO EGYPT, LEAVING
BEHIND THEIR FAMILY FOR THE
CHANCE TO SAVE HIS LIFE.
SHE SAYS, I HAD THE FEELING OF
ANY MOTHER WHO WAS AFRAID FOR
HER SON.
I WAS AFRAID THAT HIS TREATMENT
WOULD STOP. ISRAEL
WARNED THE HOSPITAL AND THEN
ATTACKED.
THE EVACUATION INITIATED BY
CANCER ADVOCATES AT THE
PALESTINE CHILDREN'S RESCUE
FUND, AND ST. JUDE'S HOSPITAL,
WITH HELP FROM EGYPT, JORDAN,
AND THE U.S.
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS CLOSELY
INVOLVED IN HELPING CHILDREN GET
OUT OF UKRAINE THAT WERE -- THAT
NEEDED CANCER TREATMENT.
IMMEDIATELY UPON HEARING ABOUT
THIS REQUEST, THE PRESIDENT
DIRECTED US TO DO WHATEVER WE
COULD TO HELP THESE CIVILIANS
WHO WERE IN VERY ACUTE
SITUATIONS GET OUT OF GAZA.
>> Reporter: THIS 2-YEAR-OLD
LEFT HER MOM AND SIBLINGS SS
BEHIND.
SADNESS MIXED WITH RELIEF.
>> SMILING FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND THEY START TO FEEL SECURE.
IT IS VERY RELIEVING AND WE HOPE
THAT WE CAN DO THAT FOR ALL THE
NEEDY CHILDREN IN GAZA.
>> ONE MORE CHILD DID GET OUT
TODAY, BUT WITH THE CHILDREN'S
HOSPITAL IN GAZA NOW CLOSED, 30
CHILDREN REMAIN TRAPPED IN THE
WAR ZONE.
SOME APPROVED TO GET OUT, BUT
