AND JUST PRAY.
PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES.
>> THE VATICAN SAYS POPE
FRANCIS' HEALTH SIM PROVING.
ESPIONAGE HOSPITALIZED WITH A
RESPIRATORY INFECTION AND HE HAS
RESUMED WORKING WHILE TREATMENTS
CONTINUE.
NBC'S REPORTER FROM ROME.
>> HI THERE, HOW ABOUT THIS FOR
A MODERN POPE?
POPE FRANCIS' TWITTER ACCOUNT
SENDING OUT A MESSAGE EVEN WHILE
HE IS ON THE TENTH FLOOR OF THE
HOSPITAL BEMIND ME THERE.
THAT'S THE FLOOR THAT CAN YOU
SEE ABOVE MY HEAD WHERE THE
BLINDS ARE PULLED DOWN.
POPE FRANCIS TWEETING THIS
MORNING, I'M TOUCHED BY THE MANY
MESSAGES RECEIVED IN THESE HOURS
AND I EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR
THE CLOSENESS AND THE PRAYER,
BECAUSE SOMETHING ONLY PEOPLE
WERE PRAYING FOR HIM OVERNIGHT.
OF COURSE HE'S 86 YEARS OLD,
SUFFERING FROM A RESPIRATORY
INFECTION, THAT IS CHALLENGING
FOR SOMEONE OF HIS AGE.
BUT THEN TODAY WE HAVE THIS VERY
POSITIVE NEWS FROM THE VATICAN,
SAYING THAT HE RESTED WELL
OVERNIGHT, THAT HE'S IMPROVING,
THAT THIS MORNING, HE WAS ABLE
TO HAVE BREAKFAST, READ THE
NEWSPAPERS, DO SOME WORK AND
EVEN BEFORE LUNCH HEAD TO THE
PRIVATE CHAPEL.
HE ACTUALLY HAS A PRIVATE CHAPEL
THERE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR
PRAYERS.
SO FOR MANY OF THE 1.4 BILLION
CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD AND
FOLKS OF OTHER FAITH, BECAUSE OF
COURSE POPE FRANCIS HAS REACHED
OUT TO MANY OTHER FAITH DURING
HIS PAPACY, THIS IS THEIR PRAYER
ANSWERED.
FOR YOU, IN THE HOSPITAL, DON'T
KNOW WHETHER HE WILL BE ABLE TO
MAKE IT TO PALM SUNDAY, NEXT
WEEK OF COURSE IS HOLY WEEK FOR
CATHOLICS, THE MOST IMPORTANT
WEEK OF THE YEAR EASTER SUNDAY
JUST TEN DAYS AWAY.
SO SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUT FOR
ANYONE WHO RESPECTS OR LOVES
POPE FRANCIS, BUT STILL A LITTLE
BIT TO WORRY ABOUT.
HE IS 86, HE DOES HAVE A NUMBER
OF HEALT
