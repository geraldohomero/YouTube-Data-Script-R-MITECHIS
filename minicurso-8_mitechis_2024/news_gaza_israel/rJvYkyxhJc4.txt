obviously worrying a situation
catastrophic is being lived in the
Gaza Strip because not only as
We said before

atmosphere hury for the rapid and
Wide spread of rodent insects
that can carry and transmit
diseases and obviously to
Propagation of virus and bacteria

The population in the Gaza Strip has
access to drinking water that comes from
Egypt and what is good for droppers no

They are not very little very little
Propic for health and this does
that they continue to spread the
