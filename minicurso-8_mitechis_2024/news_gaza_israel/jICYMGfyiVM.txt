it's been bloody it's been brutal and
intense and it could go on for two more
months Israeli media reports the Army
wants 3 to four weeks to conduct
operations in an around Kan Yunis before

Gaza and that could take a further month
one expert told Al jazer a long War

Hamas in Gaza but what is the plan
Beyond it and by alienating the
Palestinians the Palestinians in Gaza in
the West Bank as well and probably the
region they yeah but there might be some
tactical achievements but strategically
if Israel wants to live in peace with
its neighbors and first and for almost
with the Palestinians they might
actually cause more harm than than any
good Israel's defenseman Minister has
already spoken about a long and
difficult battle in Gaza and at the end
of the ceasefire talked about two more
months of intense
fighting I expect that at least in the
next month or two in December and
January and even after that that there
will be intense and powerful
fighting but the idea of the fighting
stretching beyond the end of the year
will concern America in Contra although

Israel to speak to the Israelis about
the next stage in the war when told it

deadline to the end of the war even as
it's concerned about the growing number
