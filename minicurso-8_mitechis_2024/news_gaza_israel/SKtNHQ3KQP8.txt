>> Lisa: ICE THAT TOOK 2,000
YEARS TO FORM IS MELTING AWAY ON
MOUNT EVEREST.
NOW THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS BASE
CAMP IS BEING MOVED FURTHER DOWN
THE MOUNTAIN SO CRACKING ICE
DOESN'T CLAIM MORE LIVES.
CTV'S TOM WALTERS ON THE END OF
AN OLDER, COLDER TIME.
>> Reporter: THE SOUTH BASE
CAMP ON MOUNT EVEREST IS JUST
THE STARTING PLACE FOR CLIMBERS
BUT LOCATED ON A THINNING
GLACIER, IT'S BECOMING
INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS.
BEFORE MAKING HIS SECOND TRIP TO
THE SUMMIT EARLIER THIS SPRING,
ARTHUR PRESTIGE CAMPED NEAR A
ROCK RETAINING WALL.
>>> THAT COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF
MELTING ICE.
>> OF COURSE HE SAW CREVASSES
DURING THE CLIMB, BUT OFFICIALS
IN NEPAL SAY THEY'VE BEEN
OPENING UP UNDER THE TENTS AT
BASE CAMP AND WHILE PRESTIGE WAS
THERE HE WAS ABLE
TO WASH CLOTHES IN AN EVER
GROWING STREAM OF MELT WATER.
>> THAT RIVER WAS QUITE SMALL
INITIALLY WHEN WE GOT THERE.
WHEN WE LEFT, IT WAS PRETTY BIG.
HUGE IN FACT.
>> Reporter: WITH SOME 1500
PEOPLE THERE DURING THE PEAK OF
THE SEASON, HUMAN PRESENCE AND
HUMAN WASTE MAY HAVE SOME LOCAL
EFFECT, BUT THE MELTING IS
HAPPENING HIGHER UP THE
MOUNTAIN, TOO.
PESTIGE SAW IT HERE ON THE FIRST
PART OF THE ASCENT.
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF ICE MELT
THERE IN THE FALLS.
>> Reporter: THE COLD FACT IS
THE WHOLE HIMALAYAN RANGE IS
WARMING UP.
A TEAM FROM WESTERN WASHINGTON
UNIVERSITY STUDIED CONDITIONS
THERE IN 2009 AND AGAIN IN 2019.
>> THE MOUNTAINS ARE PROBABLY
20ยบ WARMER.
EVERYTHING IS MELTING MUCH MORE
QUICKLY.
>> Reporter: IN FACT THE
ANNUAL RATE OF GLACIAL MELTING
DOUBLED IN THE PAST 20 YEARS AND
IF THE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE RISES
JUST TWO DEGREES OVER THE NEXT
80 YEARS --
>> ALMOST HALF OF THE GLACIERS
WILL BE MELTED AWAY.
>> Reporter: THAT COULD
THREATEN WATER SUPPLIES TO SOME
OF THE MOST HEAVILY POPULATED
COUNTRIES ON EARTH.
WHICH MEANS THAT FOR NOW, A PLAN
TO MOVE THE BASE CAMP ON MOUNT
EVEREST IS A SHARP REMINDER THAT
THE WHOLE WORLD IS FACING AN
UPHILL CLIMB.
