STATES AND OTHER ALLIES ARE
CURRENTLY SPENDING A LOT OF TIME
NEGOTIATING WHAT HAPPENS ON DAY
TWO, EVEN IF THE IDF MANAGES TO
DESTROY HAMAS.
THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION, CHRIS.
>> I ALSO WANT TO BRING IN NBC'S
JOSH LEDERMAN IN TEL AVIV, AND
JOSH, WE HAVE HEARD THE REPORTS
OBVIOUSLY FROM RICHARD ENGEL
ABOUT THIS UPTICK.
WE HAD GOTTEN A VERY BRIEF
STATEMENT FROM AN IDF SPOKESMAN
BASICALLY AFFIRMING THAT THEY
HAVE BEEN INCREASING THE BOMBING
IN GAZA, BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT
JUST MOMENTS AGO YOU GOT SOME
MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT THEIR
GROUND OPERATIONS IN GAZA.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT,
CHRIS, WE'VE SEEN THIS UPTICK IN
AIR STRIKES NOW CONFIRMED BY THE
ISRAELI MILITARY, BUT JUST IN
THE LAST FEW MINUTE, THE ISRAELI
MILITARY SPOKESMAN HAS SAID THAT
GROUND FORCES ARE ALSO PREPARING
TO EXPAND THEIR GROUND
OPERATIONS INTO THE GAZA STRIP
THIS EVENING, AND SO THIS WOULD
BUILD ON THE GROUND RAIDS THAT
WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST 48
HOURS FROM THE ISRAELI MILITARY,
GOING BRIEFLY INTO THE GAZA
STRIP TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS ON
HAMAS INFRASTRUCTURE, ON THEIR
TERRORIST TUNNELS AS WELL AS ON
THEIR COMMAND CENTERS AND
ANTITANK POSITIONS.
THESE ARE WHAT MILITARY EXPERTS
REFER TO AS SHAPING OPERATIONS.
THEY ARE TRYING TO ESSENTIALLY
SOFTEN THE GROUND FOR WHEN
ISRAEL EVENTUALLY GOES IN WITH
THIS LONG PROMISED GROUND
INCURSION, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST
SIGNAL THAT WE'VE GOT FROM
ISRAEL'S MILITARY THAT THIS IS
NOT LIMITED TO AN UPTICK IN AIR
STRIKES.
THEY ARE PLANNING MORE
OPERATIONS ON THE GROUND.
AND I JUST SPOKE WITH AN IDF
SPOKESMAN WHO ALSO TALKED ABOUT
THE KEY CHALLENGE THAT IS BEING
POSED BY THAT TUNNEL SYSTEM THAT
GAZA, THAT THE HAMAS
ORGANIZATION HAS BUILT
UNDERNEATH THE GAZA STRIP.
THAT APPEARS TO BE PART OF WHAT
THEY ARE TARGETING AS THEY GO IN
TONIGHT BOTH BY AIR AND ON THE
GROUND WITH THIS SPOKESMAN
SAYING THAT THIS IS BOTH AN
ADVANTAGE FOR HAMAS AND THAT
THEY CAN HIDE IN THOSE TUNNELS,
BUT IT ALSO CAN BE A WEAKNESS
BECAUSE IT CAN BECOME A DEATH
TRAP FOR HAMAS WHEN ISRAEL'S
MILITARY GOES IN.
THE OFFICIAL SAYING THAT ISRAEL
HAS A VERY SOLID IDEA RIGHT NOW
ABOUT THE NETWORK OF TUNNELS
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
DEAL WITH AS THEY GO IN ON THE
GROUND.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG
