shifting focus to israel now which is
set to hold its fourth snap election
next week days before the crucial polls
thousands of israelis have taken to the
streets to protest against prime
minister benjamin netanyahu's policies
and his leadership
local reports suggest that more than 20
000 protesters
gathered at the paris square close to
netanyahu's official residence
the protesters waved flags and carried
posters shouting
bibi go home
we are here to protest against netanyahu
and his corrupted government
this is our last chance before the
election i came to
speak and protest about the situation
when the government is
probably going to win this election
and somebody needs to
stop this because
[Music]
the government will be worse than it was
used to be and
the people must vote differently i'm
here to overthrow benjamin netanyahu
we have been here since the summer
expecting it to be better in israel
israel has been witnessing weekly
anti-establishment protests since last
year
but the saturday protests were the
largest since the beginning of the
demonstrations
the protesters demand that the prime
minister resign immediately over the
alleged corruption scandals against him
and the mishandling of the pandemic
under his leadership
netanyahu has been in power for the last
12 years and the leader hopes to retain
his seat in the tuesday vote
one thing to note here is that netanyahu
is the first israeli prime minister
to be indicted in office for corruption
and bribery
however he has denied any wrongdoings
the series of elections have been going
on since april 2019
but the winning parties failed to form
the government experts say that
netanyahu's liquid party is likely
to emerge as the biggest player but
opinion polls have not suggested a clear
winner yet
