folks i've just
spoken with prime minister netanyahu
earlier today i spoke with president
al-sisi of egypt
minister prime minister netanyahu
informed me that israel has agreed to a
mutual
unconditional fire began in less than
two hours
the egyptians have now informed us that
hamas
and the other groups in gaza have also
agreed
in my conversation with president
netanyahu i commended him
for the decision to bring the current
hostilities to a close within
less than 11 days i also emphasize what
i've said throughout this conflict
the united states fully supports
israel's right to defend itself
against indiscriminate rocket attacks
from hamas
and other gaza-based terrorist groups
that have taken the lives of innocent
civilians
in israel you know we've held intensive
high-level discussions
hour by hour literally egypt
the palestinian authority and other
middle eastern countries
with the name of avoiding the sort of
prolonged conflict we've seen in
previous years
when the hostilities have broken out
these hostilities have resulted in the
tragic deaths of so many
civilians including children and i send
my sincere condolences to all the
families
israeli and palestinians who have lost
loved ones
and my hope for a full recovery for the
wounded
the united states committed to working
with the united nations and we remain
committed to work in the united nations
and other international stakeholders to
provide rapid humanitarian assistance
and emotional international support for
the people of gaza
and the gaza reconstruction efforts
we will do this in full partnership with
the palestinian authority
authority in a manner that does not
permit hamas to simply restock its
military arsenal
i believe the palestinians and israelis
equally deserve to live safely and
securely
and to enjoy equal measures of freedom
prosperity and democracy
my administration will continue our
quiet relentless diplomacy toward that
end i believe we have a genuine
opportunity
to make progress and i'm committed to
working for it
you
