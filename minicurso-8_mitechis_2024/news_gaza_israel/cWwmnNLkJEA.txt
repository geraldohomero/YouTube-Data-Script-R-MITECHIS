a growing rift in the democratic party
over the u.s
government's unconditional support of
israel
the escalating violence between the
israeli military and hamas
is proving a big foreign policy
challenge for the biden administration
while diplomatic outreach has been
ongoing the administration has been
walking a tightrope
offering support for israel while
acknowledging palestinian hardships
israel has a right to defend itself from
these rocket attacks
but we are deeply concerned with the uh
the loss of life
among civilians especially among
among children palestinians have a right
to live in in security
and to live in peace just as israelis do
but recent polling among democrats shows
growing skepticism about israeli
policies
a gallup poll in march found that for
the first time
a majority of democrats now want to see
the u.s government apply more pressure
on israel
to resolve the conflict with
palestinians 53 percent
compared to 43 percent in 2018
and a new crop of younger democrats in
congress
is taking up the charge we must
condition aid to israel
on compliance with international human
rights and
end the apartheid we must with no
hesitation
demand that our country recognize the
unconditional support of israel has
enabled
the erasure of palestinian life in the
denial of the rights of millions of
refugees
let me be clear every single death
in this conflict is a tragedy every
rocket
and bomb that targets civilians is a war
crime
and instead of condemning play in crimes
against humanity and human rights
abuses many members of congress
have instead fallen back on a blanketed
statement
defending israel's airstrikes against
civilians
under the guise of self-defense while
the u.s government has restarted
financial aid to the palestinians
it has yet to reopen the u.s consulate
in jerusalem
a key campaign promise nor has biden yet
appointed
an ambassador to israel
at least
