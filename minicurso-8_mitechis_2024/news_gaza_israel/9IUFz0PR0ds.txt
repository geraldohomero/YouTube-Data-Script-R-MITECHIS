can you see
me the idea that this happened without
Iranian involvement is
laughable 93% of the budget over decades
the training the equipment all coming
from the
ayatolla I come here to let Israel know
that America will be with you I come
here to let the Arab world
know let's make peace if we
can destroying Hamas is
non-negotiable how we do it let's talk
so so we're here today to give Israel
what they need to do the job of
destroying the
modern-day version of Nazis Hamas we're
here today to tell Iran we're watching
you if this war grows it's coming to
your
backyard there won't be two fronts
there'll be
three I do not hate Palestinians I hate
am us I know the difference the goal
going forward is to take from this
horror and try to make this a better
world in Israel and I want to thank that
my colleagues that are traveling with us
the crimes that were committed the
barbaric actions that were committed
were committed against Israel and the
victims but these were crimes against
humanity we are all involved in
this it's in the United States interest
it's in the interest of of the civility
of of our
planet for us to Stand
United against AAS and andas never again
being able to just do this type of harm
to anyone today all of us met with a
group of families of
hostages and I cannot stop thinking
about a little three-year-old girl named
Abigail who has been taken hostage by
Hamas this is her picture her mother was
murdered and her father was murdered as
he was trying to rush little Abigail
away what kind of people commit such
atrocity
this is not a close call this is a clear
case Hamas is a terrorist group and we
must do all that we can to support
Israel in its quest to eliminate
Hamas came here
today and I think I have never seen any
group of colleagues so moved today one
of my
cousins is on the front in the
IDF when I met with those
hostages I saw in every one of
them my
family they
are Americans in their dedication to
freedom and the values of America and in
their
grief and
fear they can unite
America
