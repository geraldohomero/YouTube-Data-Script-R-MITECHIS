the applicant has now sought to invoke
this
term in the context of Israel's conduct
in a war it did not start and did not
want a war in which Israel is defending
itself against Hamas Palestinian Islamic
Jihad and other terrorist
organizations whose brutality knows no
bounds the applicant has regrettably put
before the court a profound distorted
factual and legal
picture the entirety of its case hinges
on a deliberately curated
decontextualized and manipulative
description of the reality of current
hostilities South Africa purports to
come to this court in the lofty position
of a guardian of the interest of
humanity but in delegitimizing Israel's
75-year existence in its opening
presentation
yesterday that broad commitment to
humanity rang
Hollow and in its sweeping
counterfactual
description of the Israeli Palestinian
conflict it seemed to erase both Jewish
history and any Palestinian agency or
responsibility that if there have been
acts that may be characterized as
genocidal then they have been per
perpetrated against Israel
if there is a concern about the
obligations of States under the genocide
convention then it is in relation to
their
responsibilities to act against hamas's
proudly declared agenda of
annihilation which is not a secret and
is not in doubt astonishingly the court
has been requested to indicate a
provisional measure calling on Israel to
suspend its military
operations but this amounts to an
attempt to deny Israel its ability to
meet its obligations to the defense of
its citizens to the hostages and to over
110,000 internally displaced Israelis
unable to safely return to their homes
it is respectfully submitted that the
application and request should be
dismissed for what they are a
liel designed to deny Israel the right
to defend itself according to the law
from the unprecedented Terrorist on
Onslaught it continues to
face and to free
the 136 hostages Hamas still
holds
