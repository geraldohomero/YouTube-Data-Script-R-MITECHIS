After the delay that we now know about
to the deal between Israel and Hamas.
Qatar has just announced that the truce
between the two warring parties begins
at 7 a.m.
local time.
And about ten, 11 hours later, the first
batch of Israeli hostages will be
released to probably the Red Cross in
the Gaza Strip, after which Israel will
also release Palestinians, both women
and people under the age of 19 that are
currently in Israeli prisons.
Now, unlike what we knew before, today's
announcements by Qatar, which is the
main mediator in this conflict and truce
deal, it looks like the release of
Israeli hostages will take place in
basically four batches along the along
the truce, a four day long truce.
That's what the Qataris and Israeli
Defense Ministry have just said
basically over the last few minutes.
I mean, is there any expectation that we
could see more hostages being released
that this program could run for extra
days?
The idea being that we also get extra
days of troops as well.
Well, the idea that idea has already
been built into the to the current truce
agreement.
So if after the release of 50 Israeli
hostages, Hamas decides to release or
agrees to releasing more four, four, ten
hostages, it gets another day of
extension to the truce.
So that idea is also already there.
And obviously, it was one of the main
driving forces when Qatar and others
mediated this deal because they're
hoping to basically create some time for
diplomacy to work.
Right.
Israel wasn't really looking at the idea
of of a of a cease fire very warmly just
until a couple of weeks ago.
But now that they have this deal,
they're hoping that the mediators are
hoping that they can work something out
of it and by giving diplomacy more time.
Now, as things stand, now that the
chances for that kind of longer term
cessation of hostilities looks a bit
slim, but that's what the mediators are
definitely hoping for.
And yes, the key to that would be for
Hamas to release more hostages every day
and get an extension.
And that gives more time to diplomats
and mediators to basically work
something out for the longer term.
