We will continue with more information than
It has to do with Middle East no longer
promptly
geographically in Gaza but with
some alternatives that have to do
With Pro Palestina Camila protests with
the information good day how are you doing
Good morning David and if exactly in
London this Saturday a march was generated
Pro Palestine in opposition to the offensive
from Israel who wants to be doing
against the Palestinian territory we are
speaking that tens of thousands of
people were the ones who participated
This weekend in a prog march
Palestine more specifically in the
London center expressing your
opposition to Israel's offensive in
Gaza Strip and asking for the end
immediate of the hostilities between
Israel and Hamas this march was
Organized by the British Coalition
Stop the war that would be high to war
near the Israel embassy in the
West of London as reported by the
local media on the one hand
organizers said that in the march
They participated to a quarter of
Million people is to say a lot
people as we are seeing here in the
images and what a protester said
is I think it is becoming stronger
I think the marches depend on how
The government responds to many things but
I think that ultimately the
Public opinion has changed a lot in
The last 4 months bombarded the
people who moved I'm lying
You know that is what happened this is a
genocide is what another of the
protesters who were in the
march there were a total of 100 agents of
Police from all over Britain that were
recruited to maintain this
public order in London during the end
of week and this high coalition to the
Stop The War War said this guy
of marches will continue until
reach a high permanent fire
between Israel and
never
