INTERNATIONAL OF IB Very good morning
Hello very good morning Ev is good
we dawn with what have been
statements last night last night
From the Israeli prime minister of Benjamin
Netanyahu talking about what is going to
spend that day after war
in front of ever in Gaza and in which
Somehow has clarified his words
He has said they don't seek to govern Gaza in
what seems like a clarification after
That this week did notice how I was going to
be necessary to be lived in a way
indeterminate in time does not
guaranteeing the security of the area no
I know how much that Netan's speech
Yaju how he settles that day later and
Gaza Well future I think now
There are many theories and now is the
moment a little of thinking with with
cold mind about what is what
more convenient for Gazat√≠ for
Israelis their safety but also that
The international community accepts it
Israel is suffering pressure from
of huh many countries some of them
members of the Security Committee of the
United Nations is therefore normal
that there are these bane at the time of
make a decision about the day after
In Gaza huh to govern so to speak
say effectively govern
Eh one of the regions more densely
populated from the world where it never is
intrinsically huh represented in all
the
eh different social sectors and and
politicians is very complicated too
Egypt has manifested and also Egypt
now has lessons and in a few days
has expressed against any
EH occupation by Israel in
gaza therefore we are facing a
Scenario now Arenas
Mobilizes where eh are being done
Many statements some of them
that they have a clear reading in politics
Interior of Israel other of them that
They are part of a war propaganda and
Then we also have others
statements that are more realistic and
that could seek that consensus I don't think
that right now they leave what are the
exact and precise plans that we will see in
The next weeks once leave
completing that military mission
Israeli in the Gaza Strip
