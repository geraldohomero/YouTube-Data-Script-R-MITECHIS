FIRST, WE WANT TO START LIVE IN
JERUSALEM WITH NBC NEWS
CORRESPONDENT KELLY COBIELLA,
WHAT IS THE STATUS OF KNOWS
THEY'RE IN AS FORCES PREPARE
FOR A GROUND INVASION?
>> WELL, THOSE ISRAELI
AIRSTRIKES HAVE CONTINUED
THROUGHOUT THE OVERNIGHT AND
INTO TODAY IN NORTHERN GAZA.
JUST EAST OF GAZA CITY AND ALSO
IN THE SOUTH WHERE PEOPLE WERE
TOLD TO EVACUATE TO SAFETY.
PEOPLE ARE STILL FLEEING
NORTHERN GAZA.
THEY ARE GOING BY ANYWAY THEY
CAN.
IT IS A DIFFICULT JOURNEY, NOT
ONLY BECAUSE, FRANKLY, BECAUSE
OF THE BOMBARDMENTS BUT ALSO
BECAUSE OF THE BLOCKADE THAT
HAS BEEN IN PLACE NOW FOR ABOUT
A WEEK.
THERE ARE VERY LIMITED SUPPLIES
OF FUEL.
FUEL IS RUNNING OUT.
PEOPLE SIMPLY CANNOT FEEL THEIR
CARS TO GET SOUTH.
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH TAXES TO
GET SOUTH.
SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT EVEN AWARE
OF THIS WINDOW OF SAFE PASSAGE
THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT
ANNOUNCED EARLIER TODAY.
THEY SAID THAT BETWEEN THE
HOURS OF TEN AND FOUR IN THE
AFTERNOON THERE WOULD BE TOO
SAFE PASSAGE ROUTES FROM THE
NORTH, DOWN TO THE SOUTH.
THIS COMING AFTER A CONVOY OF
EVACUEES WAS HIT BY AN ISRAELI
AIRSTRIKE LATE YESTERDAY.
70 PEOPLE KILLED, MANY OF THEM
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING TO GET
OUT.
IT IS INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS,
ESPECIALLY AS WE GET TO THE
EVENING HOURS NOW.
THERE IS A ANOTHER EMERGENCY
QUICKLY DEVELOPING ON THE
GROUND IN GAZA, AS WELL, RIGHT
NOW.
THAT IS THE LACK OF DRINKING
WATER.
THE UNITED NATIONS HAS SAID
THAT LIVES ARE AT STAKE NOW.
THE TAPS NOT RUNNING ANYMORE
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUEL THE
WATER SYSTEMS ARE NOT WORKING.
THE WATER TREATMENT BUT THE
SYSTEMS USED TO MOVE THE WATER
THROUGH THE PIPES.
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO DRINK
