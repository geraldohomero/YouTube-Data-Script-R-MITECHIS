ACTION FROM THE U.S. AND FROM

HOLDING AIGIL WEDNESDAY NIGHT
AT THE U.S. CAPITAL AND PLANNING

A WEEK AGO TODAY WE STOOD ON THE

OMIR.
WE SCREAMED HIS NAME THROUGH
SPEAKERS.
>> CAN YOU HEAR US?
WE'RE HERE.
WE'RE REALLY CLOSE TO YOU.

22-YEAR-OLD BORN AND RAISED IN
LONG ISLAND.
>> LOVES SPORTS.
>> WHAT'S HIS FAVORITE SPORT?
>> BASKETBALL AND VOLLEYBALL.
>> HIS PARENTS EMIGRATED FROM
ISRAEL 24 YEARS AGO.
THEIR FAMILIES HOLOCAUST
SURVIVORS.
WHEN OMIR DECIDED TO TAKE A GAP
YEAR BEFORE COLLEGE AND ENLIST
IN THE IDF, THEY SUPPORTED HIM.
>> BASICALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE
CAN'T JUST BE A BYSTANDER.
HE KNEADSNEEDS TO JOIN THEM AND
SHARE.
>> WERE YOU AFRAID OF THE
DANGER?
>> YES, BUT WE COULD NEVER
IMAGINE THIS SITUATION.
>> NO ONE DID.
ON OCTOBER 7th, OMIR WAS
STATIONED ALONG THE GAZA BORDER.
>> HE WAS IN HIS TANK WITH HIS
TEAM AND THEY WERE AMBUSHED.
THEY FORCED HIM OUT AND THEY
TOOK THEM.
>> WE ARE PRESSING FOR ACTION
FROM ANYBODY THAT WE SEE,
WHETHER IT'S STATE DEPARTMENT OR
FBI OR ISRAELI AUTHORITIES.
>> MANY HOSTAGE FAMILIES ARE
DEMANDING THAT ISRAEL AGREE TO A
CEASE FIRE.
>> IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, IT'S TOO
DANGEROUS.
WHATEVER THEY'VE ACHIEVED SO FAR
THEY CAN CONTINUE DOING THAT
OTHER AFTER THEY BRING THEM OUT
ALIVE.
>> LEADERS IN QATAR HAVE SAID
THAT HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE
RESUMED, WITH QATAR RELAYING
PROPOSALS BETWEEN HAMAS,
