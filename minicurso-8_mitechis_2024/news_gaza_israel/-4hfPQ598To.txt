This attack is an unprecedented
situation, and I think it completely
changes the tales in the market,
really.
And it's coming on the back of a 20%
rally in oil prices.
Already this year, bond prices in the US
have gone from three or five to about
355 already.
Well, 350 already.
And so that I think it is only going to
begin to tell on consumer sentiment.
And if oil prices stay higher for long
relative to the counterfactual, I think
that will have an impact on the economy,
especially at a time when the markets
are already fully pricing in a cyclical
recovery.
So I think it really does mean that
volatility changes, skew changes.
And while this could be near-term
inflationary, I think this is medium
term pre disinflationary.
I was going to ask you, actually,
there's almost an assumption that it's
automatically inflationary because it
means that there's more, I guess, on
shoring or end of multilateralism.
So talk me through why you think it's
the beginning of deflationary.
Well, because if oil prices are higher
relative to the kind of remember what
happened in 2022 when everybody was
worried about the Russian war, was that
in the latter half of the year, energy
prices came off significantly.
And that was one of the main reasons why
we saw Goldilocks in 23 and early parts
of 24.
So if you're beginning to see a little
bit of an oil, the early parts of an oil
shock, I mean, it's still early to call
it that.
The curve is backward, dated now only
about $7.
So if energy supplies are quite tight at
any case and uncertainty is increasing,
that brings increasing risks for the
global economy at a time when the
markets are nowhere close to price for
it.
At a time that the markets are priced
for perfection, they are priced for
Goldilocks.
This does add caution into the markets
and really says that at 450 the ten year
US Treasury is quite attractive relative
to some of the equity markets which are
trading at a 20 to 21 times forward
earnings.
So I think from that perspective this
makes that more compelling, the bond
versus the equity story.
