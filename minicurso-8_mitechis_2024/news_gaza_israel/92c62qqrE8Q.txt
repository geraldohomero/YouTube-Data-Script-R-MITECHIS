Well it's like a machinery not what
Israel is doing in the strip of
Gaza because it does not stop but
perfect and is increasingly lethal
During the last hours they were recorded
new attacks in Yan Yunis that is
Maybe the focus of conflict
important at this time in that
territory and we have the images clear
To share with you

operated close while they located
A drone and eliminated him in Jan Junis

They directed a helicopter to attack and
eliminate a terrorist
