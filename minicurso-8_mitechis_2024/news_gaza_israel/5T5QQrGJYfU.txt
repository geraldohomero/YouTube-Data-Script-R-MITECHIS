under growing pressure from members of
his own party
to do more to halt the conflict between
israel and hamas
president joe biden spoke by phone with
the israeli prime minister
monday evening while still expressing
support for israel to defend itself from
rocket attacks
a white house statement also said the
president expressed his support for a
ceasefire
and discussed u.s engagement with egypt
and other partners towards that end
that marks a shift in policy for the
administration
which had indicated it would not
pressure the two sides for a ceasefire
earlier in the day the white house press
secretary said the focus was on quiet
and intensive diplomacy our objective
is to just like it is with other
countries and our partners around the
world
is to play the role we can play in the
most constructive way possible
to bring to reduce the violence to
de-escalate the situation on the ground
and a great deal of that is going to be
through intensive quiet diplomacy behind
the scenes
still on monday the biden administration
blocked for a third time
a u.n security council statement that
would have expressed
grave concern over the worsening
violence and loss of civilian lives
while biden faces a growing chorus of
democrats urging him to call for an
immediate ceasefire
republicans are pressing the president
to reaffirm
unwavering support for israel
the united states needs to stand four
square
behind our ally and president biden must
remain strong against the growing voices
within his own party
that create false equivalence
between terrorist aggressors and
a responsible state defending itself
so far israel has resisted efforts by
egypt and other regional players to
broker
a ceasefire
