in Iran's Capital there were calls for
revenge and a settling of scores with
Israel Over the military leaders killed
earlier this week in Damascus
Syria we expect our government to put
Israel in its place said a
protester the seven Iranians among them
two top generals were in a diplomatic
building when Israeli missiles
annihilated the
premises since October the 7th Israel
has accused Iran of coordinating attacks
on Israel the incident threatens to
escalate what is essentially being a
shadow war between the two countries
into a full-blown one Iranians are
expecting retaliation this professor in
tyan who was at those funerals said
Iran's leaders will try to punish Israel
but not hit back hard enough to trigger
a wider war that it will
be uh hard enough to make them regret
the crime that They carried out uh but
also to keep the focus on their criminal
activities in in Gaza and the West
Bank what form Iran's response will take
has consumed discussion on Israeli news
programs some have touted Israel's
anti-missile defenses and profiled
people preparing for the worst including
a man who bought solar panels in case
generating stations are
hit Israel has also scrambled GPS
signals to thwart Iran from aiming
guided missiles giving commuters in Tel
Aviv wildly false readings no it's not
work it's it's says that we are in
Beirut while Israel has not admitted
responsibility for the Damascus strike
it has acknowledged hitting many Iranian
link targets such as Hezbollah and
Lebanon over the past 6 months G
Israel's prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is already promising a
response to Iran's
response whoever hurts us or plans to
hurt us we will hurt them he said as
Israelis play a grim guessing game of
what will come next Chris Brown CBC News
