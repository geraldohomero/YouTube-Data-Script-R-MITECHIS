you can't see or hear it but out in all
that vast emptiness there is a war
underway and it is now
escalating on Jordan's borders with Iraq
and Syria us-based Tower 22 is the
epicenter of rising tensions after three
American soldiers were killed in a drone
attack blamed on Iranian backed
militia in the nearest towns people are
worried that a conflict that began in
Gaza May soon spread
the situation generally is not stable as
long as there is a war in Gaza and the
same for the whole of the Middle East
and in Western
countries the Gaza war is unfair it's
killing children killing women and
there's no justice we'd lose everything
we'd lose hope if the war spreads across
the region we're about as close as we
can get to T 22 here given that it is a
closed military zone but across the
deserts of Jordan Syria and Iraq there
are many such American bases that have
come under increasing number of attacks
since the beginning of the Gaza War by
Iranian backed militia Joe Biden's
challenge is to take action that is
strong enough to deter any more of those
attacks but not so severe that it tips
the region into a much bigger
War us reprisal now seem imminent after
President Biden was asked has he decided
how he'll respond to the attack
yes and he was asked does he hold Iran
responsible I do hold respon them
responsible in the sense that they're
supplying the weapons to the people of
it may well be the most consequential
decision of his presidency a huge amount
is at
stake America's enemies and Iran's
allies across the Middle East are
watching in Yemen issuing more defiant
propaganda videos houthi Rebels are not
backing down despite us British air
strikes and Lebanon Iranian bat hisbah
militia keep up their dangerous
brinkmanship with Israel experts say the
danger is America's response only
encourages its enemies to up the
anti-2 this militia like hisbah militia
or irgc militia in in this area just
waiting when and how this next strikes
will happen in the region and then they
are coming to a next level of the
escalation from their side against the
Americans we expect that very well
across the Middle East they are holding
their breath awaiting America's next
