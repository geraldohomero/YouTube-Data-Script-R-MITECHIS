 
PARADE -- 
>> MANY SAY THEY HAVE HAD 
ENOUGH.
>> Todd: BEGIN OUR FINAL HOUR 
WITH THIS, HAPPENING TODAY, 
100,000 PLUS WILL GATHER AT THE 
NATIONAL MALL TO MARCH FOR 
ISRAEL.
>> Ainsley: GRIFF JENKINS JOINS 
US FROM THE NATIONAL MALL, WHAT 
IS GOING ON?
>> 
>> Griff: IT IS A BIG EVENT.
LET ME GIVE YOU A LOOK, YOU CAN 
SEE THE CAPITOL THROUGH THE 
ANNING OF THE STAGE.
THIS IS WHERE THE MARCH WILL 
TAKE PLACE AND ON THE STAGE BIG 
NAMES INCLUDING SPEAKER JOHNSON 
AND MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK 
SCHUMER AND HAVE ISRAEL'S 
PRESIDENT HERZOG ALONG WITH MARK
HERZOG, AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., 
HERE.
YOU CAN GET A FEEL, THERE ARE 
COP CARS AND SECURITY HERE.
HERE ARE CHAIRS SET UP FOR VIP 
DONOR PEOPLE WITH A GIFT BAG.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN THERE.
LOOK ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE 
MONUMENT, THEY HAVE SECURITY, 
PERIMETER ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE
12 TO 14 BLOCKS AND SECURITY IS 
SOMETHING THEY ARE TAKING INTO 
CONSIDERATION.
BUT WHILE YOU ARE SEEING PEOPLE 
TURNING OUT TO SUPPORT ISRAEL, 
TO FREE THE HOSTAGES AND STAND 
UP AGAINST ANTISEMITISM, YOU 
HAVE SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, 
THE SQUAD, SPEAKING OWL AND 
CALLING FOR A CEASEFIRE.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DOES 
NOT REPRESENT JUDAISM OR JEWISH 
VALUES.
AND THE JEWISH PEOPLE, IT DOES 
NOT.
>> CEASEFIRE IS NOT JUST AN 
OPTION, IT IS OUR ONLY WAY OUT 
OF THIS.
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN, I HOPE YOU 
ARE LISTENING, I'M CONSISTENT IN
TELLING THIS OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN, LISTEN TO THE MAJORITY OF
AMERICANS CALLING FOR A 
CEASEFIRE NOW.
>> Griff: ONE THING, WE'VE BEEN 
WALKING AROUND THE SECURITY 
PERIMETER TRYING TO SEE IF THE 
MARCHERS HAVE COME DOWN.
WE SAW ONE SIGN FOR THE MARCH 
ALREADY BEING DEFACED WITH "FREE
PALESTINE AND GENOCIDE" WRITTEN 
ON IT.
THAT IS WHY SECURITY IS TIGHT.
MAY OOROR /* -- MAYOR BOWSER HA 
DEPLOYED THE NATIONAL GUARD.
THE APPROXIMATELY WILL NOT BE 
HERE, PERHAPS THERE WILL BE SOME
LATE ADDITION.
I GIVE YOU ONE LAST LOOK, 
REMENTES ME WHEN YOU HAD THE 
PRO-PALESTINE MARCH A FEW WEEKS 
AGO, THEY WERE AT FREEDOM PLAZA 
AND MARCHED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
THIS WILL NOT BE A MARCH, IT 
WILL BE A RALLY.
TENS OF THOUSANDS WILL TURN OUT,
BEING BUSSED FROM PLACES TO 
RALLY FROM 1:00 TO 3:00 P.M.
THAT IS THE MAIN EVENT.
THEY ARE GETTING THE SOUND 
SYSTEM SET UP.
THERE WILL BE MUSICIANS AND AN
