THANK YOU.
BRET.
>> THEN THIS HAPPENED.
LISTEN.
>> THAT IS A STRIKE HAPPENING
VERY CLOSE TO THAT ROITERS
CAMERA.
WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT A ROITERS
CAMERAMAN WAS KILLED AND THE
AGENCY ISSUED A STATEMENT WHICH
SAID, "WE ARE DEEPLY SADDENED TO
LEARN THAT OUR VIDEOGRAPHER WAS
KILLED AND HE WAS PART OF A
SCREW IN SOUTHERN LEBANON
PROVIDING A LIVE SIGNAL.
WE'RE URGENTLY SEEKING MORE
INFORMATION WORKING WITH
AUTHORITIES IN THE REGION AND
SUPPORTING SAM'S FAMILY AND
COLLEAGUES.
ROITERS JOURNALISTS ARE SEEKING
MEDICAL CARE.
WE HAVE A PHOTO OF THE
VIDEOGRAPHER THAT WAS KILLED AND
IT SHOWS THE DANGERS OF
HEZBOLLAH GETTING INVOLVED HERE.
WE HAD IT IN 2006 AFTER THE
KIDNAPPING OF THE ISRAELI
SOLDIER IN GAZA.
THEN HEZBOLLAH GOT INVOLVED
ABOUT THREE WEEKS LATER, JULY 12
AND FIRING THE ROCKETS ON THE
BORDER INTO ISRAEL AND BORDER
SKIRMISH AND THREE ISRAELI
SOLDIERS KILLED AND ISRAEL WENT
IN HARD WITH AIR STRIKES
HEZBOLLAH IS FAR BETTER ARMED
AND ORGANIZED THAN HAMAS IN GAZA
AND HEZBOLLAH HAS TARGETTER
PRECISION MUNITIONS AND PRESENT
A FAR GREATER THREAT EVEN THAN
HAMAS DOES TO ISRAEL.
IT'S A VERY TENSE SITUATION AND
NO ONE WANTS VIOLENCE BREAKING
OUT ON THE LEBANON ISRAEL
BORDER.
>> Bret: YEAH, JONATHAN, IT IS
TRULY SAD TO HEAR THIS ANDS AND
AN EXAMPLE HOW DANGEROUS IT IS
TO COVER A WAR ZONE OVERALL AND
WE HERE AT FOX HAVE FELT THAT
DIRECTLY WITH BENJAMIN HALL AND
HIS CREW, THE LOSS OF CAMERA MAN
PIERRE AND A TRANSLATOR AND
FIXER.
THERE'S NO MORE WORD ABOUT OTHER
SKIRMISHES ALONG THAT BORDER AND
THIS INCIDENT TRACKS WITH WHAT
SANDRA AND TREY WERE TALKING
ABOUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE
HOURS.
>> YEAH, IT SEEMS TO BEAN
EXCHANGE OF FIRE OFTEN A DOZEN
CHANGES AND I WANT TO CAUTION
OUR VIEWERS ABOUT THAT AND WE
HAVEN'T HEARD OF ROCKETS COMING
IN ANY GREAT NUMBERS FROM
HEZBOLLAH INTO NORTHERN ISRAEL
AS YET.
BUT THAT WOULD BE THE FEAR.
PUSHING FIST INDICATED ROCKETS
INTO ISRAEL AND ROCKETS THAT CAN
HIT ANY CITY, ANYWHERE IN
ISRAEL.
THEY HAVE THE PRECISION TO DO
THAT AND HAVE THE RANGE TO DO
THAT.
HEZBOLLAH WILL DO WHAT IT WANTS
TO AND BY THAT IT MEANS WHAT
IRAN WANTS IT TO DO.
BRET.
>> Sandra: JONATHAN, OUR
HEARTS AND THOUGHTS AND
EVERYTHING, OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH
THE FAMILY OF
