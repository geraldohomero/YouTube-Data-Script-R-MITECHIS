in an exclusive interview for weon the
outgoing defense minister of Israel
Benny Gantz shared his views on the
current government formation with our
Network we uncorresponded in Jerusalem
Jody Cohen brings us this exclusive
interview take a look
minnes what do you say is the priority
for the opposition now
I think uh we have to be there make sure
that Israel stays in the right direction
support whatever can be supported and
reject whatever need to be rejected
uh we'll do it in a stated manner
but we are very worried with the
directions that the Prime Minister
future Prime Minister Netanyahu is
taking the country we are very upset
from one of the from few of his
nomination on the split of offices and
we'll be there to protect the Democracy
of Israel as much as needed
when you spoke with President Abbas what
was discussed between the two of you
first of all we conclude the two years
of operating with one another uh it's
not a secret that we had many
differences between us
but we had good coordination and I spoke
about the importance of keeping the
security coordination with one another
in promoting economical activities
between the two entities and the
dialogue which I think is very important
we have an argument about what will be
the end of the process but nevertheless
the Palestinians are not going anywhere
we are not going anywhere with Israelis
and eventually we'll have to figure out
ways to leave one with inside another
it's been talk about
what do you think Netanyahu really wants
to pursue that or will he
um see potential peace with Saudi Arabia
as a reason not to pursue that uh I hope
that we can promote peace with Saudi
Arabia this is a very important and
Central Arab government in this region
I don't think an annexation will serve
the right direction for the state of
Israel and Netanyahu used to be very
responsible about this issue let's see
how well the future takes us
thank you very much
