It's a standstill or it's just a frustrating situation
In front of us stands a man without feelings without values
Unhuman that's hard to come by Agreements
We're talking about Sinwar A on Bibi now
I didn't talk about Sinwar, I didn't understand
unequivocally the answer Because my baby is too
The Prime Minister answers all of these questions head on
My government is the only answer I can
To say that it certainly is Not just this frustrating situation
This is my job and my prime minister
Private is in charge of her, so of course January is a problem
A is an obstacle, but it is not an obstacle
The only obstacle is that there is no policy
Our sovereign people in his amazing country And for that
My cabinet governor and prime minister
My Prime Minister Netanyahu is even going on an outline
Huge it isn't. Only a deal is also a series in Gaza and with
Saudi Arabia normalizes if this event is imminent
Consenting to a Palestinian state is insane
In terms of The State of Israel I oppose, I think
This is a poison pill that Israel must not take
Thinks she undermines everything That we're fighting
What are we talking about the next day
Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip as in Judea
The West Bank is not a security citizen How can you
To control security in the territory of another country if
We are talking about a Palestinian state after the return
October is like talking After the 1st of September
A state that does not recognize a Palestinian state is nothing
Only we don't have to get it to us
We need to get out A travel tour of the United States
That explains why to establish a terrorist base in the heart of the Land of Israel
It would undermine all regional stability
