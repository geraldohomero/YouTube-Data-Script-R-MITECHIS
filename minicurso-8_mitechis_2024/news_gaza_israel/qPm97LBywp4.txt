victim gunned down in the car park
outside his mosque the community is
still in shock
was everything for us
along with the grief is raw anger
there's a huge amount of anger towards
the Israeli establishment towards the
occupation Authority because it is not
doing its job in relation to protecting
the Palestinian minority here it is
solely responsible for this chaos the
motives behind this murder spree appear
to be various there are family feuds
Financial disputes gang turf wars but
increasingly it seems to be groups vying
for political influence
in August the council Chief in the town
of Tira was shot dead other recent
victims had just announced their
candidacy in the Municipal elections
upcoming in November the mayor of
kufakara is considering a run for
re-election but he's worried
these crimes directly affect the local
elections in a negative way we are
seeing candidates who have withdrawn
their candidacy because of these crimes
and because of death threats
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
promised a crime task force but the
overwhelming public opinion is that
Israeli police treat the killing of
Palestinians very different to that of
Israelis the Israeli police issued a
solently statement saying that the crime
wave is a top priority and the
substantial resources have been
dedicated to it they said they thwarted
44 attempted murders so far this year
and are targeting the financial assets
of suspected criminals recent protests
have drawn thousands of demonstrators
many carrying symbolic white coffins
Israel's Palestinian citizens have long
complained that they don't receive the
rights that they're entitled to the
unabated killings suggest there's
evidence for that belief Paul Brennan Al
