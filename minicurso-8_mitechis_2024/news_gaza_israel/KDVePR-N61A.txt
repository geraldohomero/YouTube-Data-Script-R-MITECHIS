COVERAGE RIGHT NOW.
>>> HELLO I'M ANA CABRERA
REPORTING FROM NEW YORK.
WE BEGIN WITH BREAKING NEWS THIS
MORNING, A TENTATIVE HOSTAGE
DEAL REACHED PENDING ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT APPROVAL.
NOW, THE ISRAELI PRIME
MINISTER'S OFFICE JUST
ANNOUNCING THE WAR CABINET WILL
CONVENE AT 11:00 A.M. EASTERN
TIME.
SO ONE HOUR FROM NOW.
THIS AFTER A HAMAS LEADER SAID
THE GROUP IS, QUOTE, CLOSE TO A
TRUCE AGREEMENT WITH ISRAEL AND
MULTIPLE NEWS REPORTS ARE
OUTLINING THE POSSIBLE FRAMEWORK
OF A DEAL THAT WOULD INCLUDE A
TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE AND THE
RELEASE OF AT LEAST 50 HOSTAGES
HELD BY HAMAS IN EXCHANGE FOR
PALESTINIAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN
IN ISRAEL.
LET'S GET RIGHT TO NBC'S KEIR
SIMMONS IN TEL AVIV, ISRAEL.
AND GABE GUTIERREZ IS WITH US
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE
DETAILS OF THIS PLAN?
>> Reporter: WELL, WE KNOW THAT
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU HAS
SAID THAT HE HOPES THAT THERE
WILL BE GOOD NEWS SOON, THAT
THERE IS GOING TO BE A SERIES OF
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT MEETINGS
COMING UP IN THE COMING HOURS
THAT WILL FINISH WITH A MEETING
OF THE GOVERNMENT AT 8:00 HERE.
NOW 5:00.
THAT'S THREE HOURS AWAY, IN
WHICH THERE WILL BE A VOTE.
THAT MEETING HAS BEEN OPENLY
DESCRIBED AS ONE THAT WILL
DISCUSS THE DEVELOPMENTS AROUND
THE HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS.
SO, IT IS LOOKING VERY, VERY
PROMISING.
I KNOW GABE HAS SOME MORE
REPORTING, BUT I WILL JUST SAY
THAT MULTIPLE REPORTS HERE IN
ISRAEL, SOURCING BOTH THE
ISRAELIS AND HAMAS, ARE TALKING
ABOUT A DEAL THAT LOOKS AT
AROUND 50 HOSTAGES RELEASED IN
WAVES OVER A NUMBER OF DAYS,
MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS, THEY
WOULD ALSO LIKELY BE
HUMANITARIAN AID AS PART OF THE
DEAL.
THAT MIGHT WELL INCLUDE FUEL.
THERE HAS BEEN CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT WHETHER THAT WOULD ALSO
INCLUDE NO LONGER HAVING DRONES
FLY OVER SOUTHERN GAZA FOR A
PERIOD OF TIME.
SO, ALL OF THESE DETAILS I
SUSPECT WILL EMERGE WHEN WHAT WE
THINK MAY HAPPEN ASSUMING THIS
ALL HAPPENS AND IT IS NOT DONE
UNTIL IT IS DONE, PEOPLE ARE
SAYING THAT, MANY OFFICIALS ARE
SAYING THAT, WHEN WE THINK THIS
HAPPENS, THERE WILL BE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE QATARIS WHO
HAVE MEDIATED THE TALKS AND
WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT EXACTLY
WHAT DEAL THEY HAVE MANAGED TO
