AND DEMONSTRATIONS AS PEACEFUL
SEE HERE. BACK TO YOU FROM
TIMES SQUARE.
>> THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT
TO US, NATALIE.
>>> ISRAELI'S WAR WITH HAMAS
CONTINUES TO ESCALATE WITH MORE
MISSILES RAINING DOWN ON THE
GAZA STRIP. THE MILITARY WARNS
A MASSIVE MILITARY GROUND
ACTION IS IMMINENT. THIS IS
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS
ON THE MOVE AFTER LEAFLETS WERE
DROPPED FROM THE SKY ASKING
>> CBS 2'S IAN LEE JOINING US
NOW FROM TEL AVIV. LET'S TALK
MORE ABOUT THOSE EVACUATION
PEOPLE NORTHERN PART OF GAZA,
THAT JUST SOUNDS LIKE A
MONUMENTAL THING TO DO AS AN
INDIVIDUAL, LET ALONE THAT MANY
PEOPLE. WHAT'S HAPPENING? CAN
>> Reporter: YEAH, DANA. ALL
DAY WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE STREAMING
SOUTH FROM THAT NORTHERN
ENCLAVE OF THE GAZA STRIP, BUT
IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE THAT MANY
PEOPLE, OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE,
DOWN SOUTH. THE INFRASTRUCTURE
ISN'T THERE FOR IT AND THERE
ISN'T THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO
HOUSE THAT MANY PEOPLE. THEY

OVERFLOWING WITH THE INJURED.
MORE THAN 1,800 PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN KILLED ACCORDING TO

OPERATION WILL LOOK LIKE. WE'VE
HEARD FROM ISRAELI MILITARY
OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE HAD
TROOPS IN TANKS INSIDE GAZA ON
RAIDS GOING AFTER MILITANTS,
ALSO LOOKING FOR CLUES AS TO
TRYING TO FIND THOSE PEOPLE WHO
ARE TAKEN HOSTAGE, BUT REALLY
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE A SHIFT
FROM THE AIR WAR THAT'S TAKING
PLACE WITH BOMBS DROPPED IN
GAZA TO THE START OF WHAT LOOKS
LIKE THE BEGINNING OF A GROUND
INCURSION.
>> IAN, IN THE BRIEF TIME THAT
WE HAVE, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT
THE U.S. IS DOING ABOUT
AMERICANS AND SOME NEW YORKERS
WHO REALLY WANT TO GET OUT OF
ISRAEL?
>> Reporter: YEAH. THERE ARE
ROUGHLY 20,000 AMERICANS WHO
WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE. THE
UNITED STATES SAYS THEY'LL TRY
TO DO IT BY LAND, SEA, OR AIR.
THERE'S CHARTERED FLIGHTS
THEY'RE LOOKING INTO. THERE'S
ALSO REPORTED TO BE HUNDREDS OF
AMERICANS STUCK IN GAZA AS
