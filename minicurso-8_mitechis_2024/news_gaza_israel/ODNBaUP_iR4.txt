prime minister naftali bennett landed in
the gulf state of bahrain bennett's
lightning trip to the gulf is the first
public visit by an israeli prime
minister to bahrain the visit also comes
two weeks after the country signed a
defense agreement to counter rising
tensions in the gulf bennett's two-day
trip to bahrain is also the highest
level visit since the u.s broker 2020
abraham records which defied decades of
arab consensus that ruled out ties in
the absence of a solution to the
israeli-palestinian conflict
i think especially in these tumultuous
times
it's important that from this region
we send a message of goodwill
of cooperation
of standing together
against the common challenges
and of building bridges to the future
the israeli prime minister is also
expected to meet bahrain's crown prince

to strengthen bilateral ties with a
special focus on economic and diplomatic
ties apart from this bennett who is also
set to see other top officials and
members of the jewish community said
that he will hold a series of meetings
with a common goal that is to fill with
energy and content and send a message of
goodwill in recent times israel has
stepped up cooperation with the gulf
states
