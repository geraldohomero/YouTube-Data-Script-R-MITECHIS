canada's relationship with the u.s has
also
weathered some rough patches and tonight
the same white house trade advisor who's
targeted this country in the past
is now insulting the contribution of our
troops
in afghanistan ctv's richard madden on
peter navarro's comments
u.s president donald trump makes no
secret what he thinks about canada
but now his top trade advisor peter
navarro is questioning the value of
canadian soldiers
who risked their lives in the u.s led
war in afghanistan
were they doing us a favor or were they
bought into the idea that
they needed to do that as part of a
global effort against terrorism
i mean if they were just doing us a
favor
maybe their government should have been
thrown out of office
i mean it was like every time that that
a canadian shows up in a uniform
it's like doing us a favor i mean how's
that work it was
mind-blowing to me here you have
arguably america's closest ally in many
respects and the dismissiveness canada
joined the afghan war after 9 11.
158 troops died thousands more suffer
mental
and physical injuries a commander of the
mission general rick hillier
calls navarro's comments outrageous
every canadian should be insulted by
comments like that and to put it all in
sort of that view
is just ignorance and ignorance perhaps
is more frightening than being insulted
navarro's remarks are in a new book by
journalist jim sciutto called the madman
theory
he explores how trump's unpredictable
style and threats are alienating allies
and empowering america's enemies there's
a very zero-sum approach that navarro
and the president have
sort of what have you done for us lately
kind of approach and it's not just
soldiers
navarro views canada's liberal
government with disdain
i mean what's good about canada i mean
they are
they are much more kind of bernie
sanders elizabeth warren
former u.s defense secretary leon
panetta tells ctv news
trump's vision of america first has
become america
isolated it sends a signal
to the rest of the world that they
cannot trust
the united states and trump is expected
to continue his nationalist agenda if he
wins a second term
although his party didn't bother writing
a platform at the convention
just a ringing endorsement of his world
