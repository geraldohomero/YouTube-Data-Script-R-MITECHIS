And of course we can not forget
What happened in Israel with this brutal
attack around 14 people who
were brutally murdered between
They children older adolescents
And of course before the Viip it was generated
made a great exhibition in tribute
no and showing who these were
People these victims of the brutal
ever attack by the University of
Telavid was the one who organized this then
exposure this brutal attack of the 7 of
October perpetrated by armed men
of ever
Eh the truth is that good there in this
exhibition could be seen photographs not
of the people who died that were
kidnapped also or are
missing after the attacks that
thus perpetuated death not because of
assumption of these more than 1 around
14 people in this case could be seen
What were this number also
seats no more than 1000 than where
They were there in this main auditorium
of the campus a space that is normally
used to house graduations and
Good events in each armchair in each
seat was the photo of each of
the victims who were taken by this
group never between those who died and for
assumption those who are kidnapped
Also the initiative launched on 19
October was organized by the union of
University students and is part
also of a broader project
called united against terrorism that
involves other institutions of
Europe and the United States with the objective
to raise awareness about attacks
of October 7 as always we show
What happens not the victims on the side
of gaza of course civilians
Palestinians who die that lose the
life in these brutal attacks but
We also show what happens in
Israel not with the number of victims
They were brutally
