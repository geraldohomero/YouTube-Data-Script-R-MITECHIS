I come to Israel with a single message
you're not
alone you are not
alone as long as the United States
stands and we will stand forever we will
not let you ever be
alone most
importantly the uh I know the recent of
terrorist assault on the people of this
nation has left a deep deep wound more
than 1,300 innocent Israelis killed
including at least 31 American citizens
by the terrorist group Hamas hundreds
hundreds of young people at a music
festival the festival was for peace for
peace gunned down as they ran for their
lives scores of Innocence from infants
to elderly grandparents Israelis and
Americans taken hostage children
slaughtered babies slaughtered entire
families
massacred rape beheadings bodies burned
alive
Hamas committed atrocities that recall
the worst ravages of Isis unleashing
pure unadulterated evil upon the
world there's no rationalizing it no
excusing it period the brutality we saw
would have cut deep anywhere in the
world but it cuts deeper here in
Israel October 7th which was sacred was
sacred Jewish holiday
became the deadliest day for the Jewish
people since the
Holocaust it has brought to the surface
painful memories and scars left by
Millennia of anti-Semitism and the
genocide of the Jewish
people the world watched then it knew
and the world did
nothing we will not stand by and do
nothing
again not today not tomorrow not ever
to those who are living in limbo waiting
desperately to learn the fate of a loved
one especially to families of the
hostages you're not
alone we're working with Partners
throughout the region pursuing every
Avenue to bring home those who are being
held captive by
Hamas I can't speak publicly about all
the details but let me assure you for me
as the American president there's no
higher priority than the release and
safe return of all these hostage
just
