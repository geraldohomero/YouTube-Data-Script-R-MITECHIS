samira dejani budari and her husband
adele
most likely have just two months left in
the family house
she grew up in i'm thinking a lot about
that sometimes i
say talk to myself samira stop thinking
think about another things the israeli
courts which will
soon issue a final ruling regard these
cases in sheikh jarrah as
private property disputes between
palestinians and
jewish settlers it's usually to yell at
me but i didn't do this
you are stealing my house and if i don't
steal it someone else is going to steal
it
no the budaris and other families who
face eviction from the neighborhood
say it's the latest example of them
being forced out
and replaced with jews back in the 1950s
when samira's family arrived from
israeli west
jerusalem as refugees her father named
the new garden trees
after his kids unfortunately
my tree and without leaves now and
without the
green branches but the roots are very
deep
so deep these latest proposed evictions
have led to protests
scuffles and fights with israeli
settlers already in the area
eventually escalating into the deadly
airstrikes and rocket attacks
this month when the state of israel was
founded hundreds of thousands of
palestinians lost their homes and their
land
and became refugees a few moved into
sheikh jarrah
supported by jordan and the un then in
1967 israel occupied east jerusalem
including sheikh jarrah most countries
still consider that
illegal jews with historical links to
the land could
claim ownership palestinians have no
equivalent legal right
to reclaim homes and land they've lost
this is
one of the pictures that i love the
budari's daughter rasha now lives in
canada
and finds it hard to watch this play out
from afar
i'm so proud of what they're doing
speaking up
not giving giving up not never backing
down
the sense of community and how how the
neighborhood residents just are coming
together
it's not a tenants versus landlord case
rather are we're fighting for
our right to exist to maintain living
in jerusalem a city where there's little
room left on which to build
and if palestinians leave they can lose
residency rights
we are both in the 70s
and to begin a new life in this age
it's not possible but on august 1st it's
likely
they will have little choice redmond
