a gutted Road still bearing traces of
the passage of Israeli bulldozers
crumbling buildings in storefronts and
power lines barely hanging on by a
thread these scenes of Destruction have
become commonplace in the West Bank Camp
of Nur Shams where the Israeli Army
regularly carries out military
operations they broke Windows they
demolished houses mine was raised twice
by bulldo it's intentional look at the
streets there no electricity 3 or 4 days
a week no water either the seage water
spreads everywhere in the
camp the Israeli Army says raising the
roads is necessary in order to prevent
Palestinians from targeting their
convoys with explosive devices but many
here feel there's more to this
strategy the intention behind this
demolition operations is to rile up the
population in nor shams
but it's also a continuation of Israel's
terrorist campaign against unra in
refugee camps which is a result of the
atrocities committed during the
nakba nakba catastrophe in Arabic a
reference to The forc Exodus of hundreds
of thousands of Palestinians in the 1948
Arab Israeli War and which many feel
never truly ended in this Camp more than
350 families have seen their homes
completely or partially destroyed since
October 7th and when the city attempts
to rebuild Israeli forces come back and
Destroy
again Municipal teams engage in repair
work on the roads to allow traffic to
resume but these are small interventions
and we don't have the capacity to fully
rebuild the streets it cost us â‚¬3.7
million EUR in repairs in the past 6
months
alone nor Shams is one of four refugee
camps in the north of the West Bank all
have paid a heavy price since the start
of the war on October
7th
