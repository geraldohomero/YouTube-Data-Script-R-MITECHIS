what is striking in the attack
which took place yesterday is that there were 24
Israeli soldiers who were killed on
figure CERT is important but what
move the population is the 21
reservists then in Israel all
world is reservist men and women
Everyone does their military service
Resilience is part of life is
Beat to ensure the security of Israel
know that you are sending your own on the side
of the Gaza Strip is part the
daily life of Israelis and they
agree behind this idea
fundamentally uh but then you
have the reality that catches up and when
You have relatives that these are
young children who at one point
Finally are more young children but
These are I was going to say young people
who at one point come to find
Death or older people
Inevitably after a given moment
Mark the opinion behind you have
also another problem is that
Uh 21 reservist soldiers 24 in all uh
It was a lot indeed they were
So killed with a rocket attack
at the RPG but behind it also means
that you have real fights in the
Gaza strip and that now you
are in the war that Israel leads
Since its history which is the most
long that she is never known
this longest war and therefore
necessarily the number of deaths will also be
important and what we have today
is that we have a certain number
indications on the number of deaths of
side of Israeli soldiers we don't have
On the side of the wounded on the side of the injured
Israeli communication is
extremely silent certainly
Because the figures are also
important and reality is that
obviously Israel is strong on the side of
Gaza band I remind you that
Face we are the Hamas gives the figure of
25,000 people who were killed
Certainly civilians but behind it
means you have real
fighters and that Hamas today
These are people who are cured are
people who fight like an army
These are people who will seek in
the urban fight that will seek in
intelligence and that actually
You have attacks that are
extremely hard and that the army
Israeli therefore effectively wiped out
heavy difficulties to advance it the
done and she does it with method but
Obviously she also I was going to say a
price to pay
