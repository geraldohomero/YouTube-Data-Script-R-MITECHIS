 
FOR TRAVEL BETWEEN MAY 15TH AND
MAY 21ST.
NOW, BACK TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S TRIP.
JUSTIN TRUDEAU IS IN SOUTH 
KOREA WHERE HE STRUCK NEW DEALS
TO SECURE VITAL SUPPLY CHAINS, 
BUT THE DISPUTE OVER A WINDSOR 
EV
BATTERY PLANT HAS FOLLOWED 
THE PRIME MINISTER OVERSEAS.
GLEN MCGREGOR IS TRAVELLING 
WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND 
JOINS ME FROM SEOUL WITH THE 
LATEST.
GLEN, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
THE P.M. ANNOUNCED DEALS ON 
SUPPLY CHAINS. 
>> YOU DIDN'T GET A WHOLE LOT 
OF DETAIL ABOUT THIS.
A BIG POTENTIAL MARKET FOR 
CANADA SELLING OUR CRITICAL 
MINERAL TO KOREA AND 
PARTICULARLY KOREA'S AUTO 
SECTOR.
THEY'RE DESPERATE TO OBTAIN THE
SUPPLIES THEY NEED TO MAKE 
BATTERIES.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE WHOLE BUSINESS INVOLVING 
THE FACTOR IN WINDSOR, ONTARIO,
A CONSORTIUM OF STELLANTIS AND 
LG
ENERGY WHICH IS A KOREAN 
COMPANY HAS PUT A REAL CLOUD 
OVER THIS WHOLE -- A MINI TRADE
MISSION THE PRIME MINISTER IS 
CONDUCTING HERE.
HE WAS JUST -- JUST CAME BACK A
FEW MINUTES AGO TO THE HOTEL 
FROM A STATE DINNER WITH SOUTH 
KOREA'S PRESIDENT AND A LOT OF 
HOPE THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME 
FACE-TIME OR HISTORY MINISTER 
WOULD GET FACE-TIME AT THAT 
EVENT WITH LG
OFFICIALS.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY 
HAPPENED THERE.
WE KNOW THE PRIME MINISTER POKE
VERY WARMLY ABOUT THE 
CANADA/KOREA RELATIONSHIP.
HE TALKED ABOUT THE DEAL REALLY
SAYING VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT.
I THINK WE GET THE SENSE FROM 
THE PEOPLE AROUND THE PRIME 
MINISTER THAT THEY AREN'T 
EXPECTING A BREAKTHROUGH TO 
OCCUR IN SEOUL.
GOING HAVE TO COME BACK IN 
CANADA, PARTICULARLY THIS 
GOVERNMENT -- THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S OFFICE VERY FIRMLY 
BELIEVES THAT IT'S UP TO
MILITARY AGGRESSION BY BOTH 
THOSE COUNTRIES CONTINUED TO.
MISSILE TESTING BY NORTH KOREA 
IS A CONSTANT WORRY HERE IN THE
SOUTH AND IN THE REGION AT 
LARGE, OF COURSE, CHINA'S 
AGGRESSION TOWARDS TAIWAN 
CONDUCTING NAVAL EXERCISES IN 
THE WATERS NEARBY.
A VERY UNSETTLED.
THESE ARE THEMES DISCUSSED HERE
BETWEEN THE KOREAN PRESIDENT 
AND JUSTIN TRUDEAU, BUT ALSO A 
THEME THAT'S GOING TO CARRY 
OVER WHEN TRUDEAU LEAVES 
TOMORROW HEADING TO HIROSHIMA, 
JAPAN TO THE G7 SUMMIT.
THESE ARE ITEMS ON TOP OF THE 
AGENDA AND A THE SITUATION 
INVOLVING RUSSIA IS THE TOP 
AGENDA IT
