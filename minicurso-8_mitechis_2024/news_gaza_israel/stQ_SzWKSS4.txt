the message was clear
as the un relief agency chief visited
sheikh jarrah at the start of this month
he called on israel to cancel the
evictions in the occupied east jerusalem
neighborhood
onward continues to call on the israeli
authorities to out
this displacement and to protect the
rights and dignity of palestinian
refugees in the west bank
including here in sherdara where we are
today
this eviction
violates international law and israel's
obligation as an occupying power
for unawa
palestinian refugees are facing a second
displacement in living memory
as sheikh jarrah families wait for the
courts to decide whether they can stay
in their homes
hundreds in gaza have had theirs reduced
to rubble
children pick through what's left of
their belongings
trying to find items to salvage
mansour and manal abdulgadjun lost the
home they shared with their 11 children
in the recent israeli bombardment
one day we had a house the next day we
had nothing our house was shot by the
occupiers two reconnaissance strikes hit
the house without warning and we escaped
immediately we went to a school then we
came back home but there was no house
left
i don't have shelter anymore i'm
homeless and at the moment i'm living on
the street and the children are living
in school we don't have shelter anymore
this naxa day the whole family will
commemorate the losses of the 1967
six-day war from a temporary shelter
in the immediate aftermath of their own
terrible loss
at the moment i don't want anything from
this world except to live a normal life
with my family to have inner peace
security and to live according to human
rights safe and sound god willing this
will be the case
the un human rights council has said it
will undertake an open-ended
international investigation
into rights violations during the latest
attacks on gaza
and into what they call
systematic abuses in the occupied
palestinian territories and inside
israel
for the latest victims of israel's
aggression
this year the remembrance of what took
place 54 years ago on naxa day
will likely feel closer than ever
