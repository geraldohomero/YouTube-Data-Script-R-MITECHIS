let's go wounded a lot of confusion and
tensions in Jerusalem Israel thought
commemorate this Monday the reunification of
The city and well the day has turned into
Palestinian resistance days with
A new act at the end of the day
Gwendoline de Bono Le Hamas who orders
The withdrawal of Israeli forces
deployed on the mosques esplanade
Yes absolutely then Hamas launched a
ultimatum in the Israeli government and
asks him to withdraw and well
police forces deployed on a lake
sister I quote this press release he asked
also to withdraw the forces from
police who are deployed in the
district of Cheikh Jarrah is where
live families threatened with expulsion
They also ask for release
Palestinians
And although they were imprisoned these
last days then according to our
Information in any case my knowledge
Police forces have gone from
The esplanade of mosques around noon
on the other hand of course there are always
police officers who are deployed in this
rue du district of Sheikh Jarrah where
live these families threatened with expulsion
It is true that Healy has a lot of
tension also in parallel to
Jerusalem in the Gaza Strip there
should not forget it in several
Roquettes were fired last night
Several rockets were pulled this
morning and there is the will on the part of the
government to pay attention to this
that it happens at the borders with Gaza
It is perhaps in this context that he
must understand the cancellation of this
settlers' walk is a walk that has
place every year traditionally
For this day of Jerusalem
settlers normally involves the door of
Damascus one that is the bastion is
young Palestinians who face there
the police every night they continue
then in the Muslim district of the
old town and well the route of this
walking has been changed and then it has everything
simply been canceled after several
calls from security managers
government of Benyamin Netanyahu has
ended up going back to soothe the
situation in Jerusalem certainly but
in any case to pay very attention to
What this
what the situation in the band of
Gaza does not take one does not take
enormous proportions with others
Roquette attacks
Thank you Gwendoline de Bonhommes Jerusalem
