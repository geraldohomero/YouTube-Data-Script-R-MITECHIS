the names of the dead in gaza read aloud
outside the israeli embassy in
washington israeli airstrikes have
killed more than 200 people in the
besieged strip and dozens of them are
children the disproportionate attacks
have mobilized and angered many here
they're demanding the u.s make its
relationship with israel a conditional
one over and over and over again you see
our voices silenced you see policy
makers not give a damn about
palestinians
similar scenes played out in new york
city
and dearborn michigan which boasts the
largest arab american community in the
u.s
this as president joe biden arrived in
town on a visit to the ford electric
vehicle center we are here today to make
sure that president biden knows that the
dearborn community and the arab american
community and all of michigan that we
are not going to stay silent while he
waltzes into our city while saying he is
giving unwavering support to the israeli
government the president was greeted by
rashida tlaib the only
palestinian-american in congress and an
outspoken critic of israel he later
addressed her directly
i want to say to you that
i admire your
intellect i admire your passion
and i admire your concern for so many
other people
and it's my from my heart
i pray that your grandmom and family are
well
i promise you i can do everything you
see that they are on the west bank
but the white house has done little to
pressure its ally israel to pull back
mass protests have taken place across
the u.s all week including this one in
chicago a major hub for palestinian
americans
the scale of these protests is
unprecedented and much of that is
because there's been a notable shift in
the narrative on palestinians in this
country a lot of that stems from the
organizing of black lives matter
protests last year and the messaging on
rage resistance and solidarity
we are challenging this system this
movement has so much to do with social
media so much to do with solidarity and
so much to do
and it's here in the u.s capitol where
protesters know their leaders have the
leverage to end the bloodshed ismin
