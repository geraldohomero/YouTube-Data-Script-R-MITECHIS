>> Sandra: MIKE, WEAVER SEEN
LIVE VIDEO OF A WOMAN HELD HOES
TANGERINE BY HAMAS AND HER
MOTHER IS RE-CASSIOPPIING.
MIKE.
REPORTER: YEAH, HAD A
CONVERSATION WITH HER MOTHER,
SANDRA.
KAREN SHEN SAID SHE TRUSTS HER
GOVERNMENT, TRUSTS THE ARMY TO
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT CONDUCTING
THE GROUND OFFENSIVE DESPITE THE
OBVIOUS VULNERABILITY OF HER
DAUGHTER.
WHAT IS IT LIKE WHEN YOU LEARN
YOUR CHILD HAS BEEN TAKEN
HOSTAGE?
>> IT'S THE WORST NIGHTMARE FOR
EVERY MOTHER IN THE WORLD TO
KNOW THAT HER CHILD HAS BEEN
TAKING HOSTAGE BY ANIMALS.
YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GIVING
HER FOOD OR A PLACE TO SLEEP AND
IT'S THE WORST MIGHT MARE IN THE
WORLD.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF SHE'S DEAD OR
ALIVE.
I KNEW NOTHING UNTIL YESTERDAY.
I SAW THIS VIDEO AND THE FIRST
REACTION WAS SCREAMING AND
SHOUTING AND THE OTHER REACTION
WAS AT THIS MOMENT IN MY LIFE
AND THE THIRD REACTION WAS AFTER
EVERYBODY WENT HOME AND I SAT
ALONE AND WATCHED THE VIDEO.
I SEE MY BABY IN PAIN, PHYSICAL
PAIN.
SHE'S VERY SCARED AND SHE'S VERY
WHITE.
REPORTER: DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE
TO HER CAPTOR S?
>> I DEMAND YOU TO BRING MY BABY
HOME NOW.
THE SAME SITUATION SHE IS IN THE
VIDEO, YOU CAN'T TAKE A CHILD, A
INNOCENT CHILD THAT'S JUST GOING
TO A FESTIVAL TO HAVE FUN AND TO
SHOOT HER AND TO DRAG HER AND TO
SQUARE HER AND GOD KNOWS WHAT
ELSE.
REPORTER: YESTERDAY A SPOKESMAN
FOR THE IDF WHEN YOU MEET THE
NEEDS OF THE ARMY TODAY COLONEL
RICHARD SAID EVERYONE IS TALKING
ABOUT A GROUND OFFENSIVE AND
SANDRA.
>> Sandra: OBVIOUSLY JUST
COMPLETELY HEART BREAKING TO
HEAR FROM THAT MOTHER THERE.
MIKE, SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW
TOO IS WHEN A VIDEO LIKE THAT IS
RELEASE WHEN HAD IT TOOK PLACE
AND WHEN THEY TOOK THAT VIDEO OF
THEIR HOSTAGE AND WHETHER OR NOT
SHE'S STILL ALIVE TODAY.
REPORTER: NOT NECESSARILY PROOF
OF LIFE IS SOMETHING THAT'S
REQUIRED FOR ALL HOSTAGE
NEGOTIATIONS AND IN FACT SOME
PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT THEM AND
DETERMINED IF THAT VIDEO IS A
COUPLE OF DAYS OLD.
ALL YOU CAN GO ON WITH THAT
VIDEO IS THAT SHE APPEARS ALIVE
IN SOME WAY HEALTHY BUT SCARED
IN THE VIDEO.
>> Sandra: HOPE SHE'LL BE
RETURNED SAFELY
