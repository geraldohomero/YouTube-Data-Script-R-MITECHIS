Is Iran then bracing for a potential
counterattack from Israel?
Morning, Tom.
Publicly, that's the important caveat.
But publicly, no.
There may be plenty of organization
going on behind the scenes, but I think
Iran is very keen to to present a
picture where life is continuing as
normal in Iran.
That's, of course, very unlike what we
saw in the past week in Israel with
these mobilizations and disruptions to
normal life.
So far, the only disruption we've seen
is cancellation of flights yesterday in
many of Iran's major airports, but
that's been now lifted.
So the message is one of normalization,
at least publicly, as I say.
At the same time, I think you had the
the threat there from the military
official that if Israel does respond
aggressively, Iran is sending a message
that it will be prepared to attack again
and is keen to sort of strike that
balance and say this is done, but we are
prepared to come back here if we're
forced to.
And Patrick, of course, it signals to
many that the conflict, the tensions
between between Iran and Israel, long
running as they have been have come have
come out of the shadows then.
What does it mean, though, for the
shadow war that had been prior prior to
this weekend and the tensions between
these two sides?
That's right.
There was some really interesting
comments from Iranian military and
government officials yesterday where
they said, for example, this strike
marks a new equation in that
relationship or is the end of what they
call strategic patience, where they've
been willing to sort of let Israeli
attacks slide and strike back when it
suits them rather than being rushed into
things.
The message now is that whenever
excuse me, whenever Israel does strike,
Iran does strike Iranian strikes, its
assets, its interests
be that in Iran or abroad that Iran will
be willing to strike Israel directly in
the way that we saw over the weekend.
That's new.
That dynamic is new.
And I think that makes for a much more
fragile dynamic in that shadow war,
where with previously incidents that
have been perhaps allowed to let slide
or they've been escalated through
through revenge.
Much further down the line.
Iran is signaling publicly, at least,
that from now on that won't be the case.
The response will be immediate and it
will be direct.
