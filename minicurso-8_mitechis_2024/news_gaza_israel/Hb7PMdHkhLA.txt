INTERNATIONAL GOODWILL IN ORDER
TO ADVANCE ITS GOALS AGAINST
ISRAEL.
>> EYLON, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THAT INTERNATIONAL GOODWILL,
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE IS A JUMBO
JET FULL OF EMERGENCY SUPPLIES,
MEDICAL SUPPLIES, THAT IS
SITTING IN EGYPT.
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
HAS APPEALED TO ISRAEL TO
PLEASE ALLOW THEM TO BRING BACK
AID IN.
I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, WHAT
IS ISRAEL'S STANCE NOT LETTING
THAT AID ENTER INTO GAZA, WHERE
YOU KNOW, I KNOW BECAUSE YOU
HAVE SEEN THE PICTURES, PEOPLE
ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE THERE
RIGHT NOW, AND THERE IS THAT
MASS MOVEMENT OF PALESTINIANS
TO TRY TO GET OUT TO THE SOUTH.
>> THE SITUATIONS AND THE SEAMS
INSIDE THE GAZA STRIP ARE VERY
DIFFICULT TO WATCH.
I HAVE TO SAY, EVERYONE IN THIS
COUNTRY IS EMOTIONALLY
EXHAUSTED, AND PULVERIZE FROM
THE GRUESOME IMAGES WE'VE BEEN
SEEING ON OUR SCREENS SINCE THE
OCTOBER 7TH MASSACRE.
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO
UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THE
SITUATION ON THE GROUND IS ON
ISRAEL.
ON SATURDAY MORNING, HAMAS
ATTACKED AND DESTROYED THE
CROSSING BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE
GAZA STRIP.
THE HEIRESS CROSSING.
IT TOOK THE CROSSING, IT NO
DOUBT EVERYONE IT COULD, IT
BLEW UP AS MANY FACILITIES AS A
GOOD, AND THAT CROSSING IS NO
LONGER OPERATIONAL.
NOT ONLY, THAT BUT THE ENTIRE
SITUATION IS A WAR ZONE RIGHT
NOW.
WE HAVE HAD OVER 6000 ROCKETS
FIRED AT ISRAEL OVER THE SPACE
OF THE LAST WEEK.
MANY OF THOSE ROCKETS FLYING
ALMOST ON A MINUTE BY MINUTE
BASIS ON THE AREA IMMEDIATELY
ADJACENT TO THE GAZA STRIP.
ESSENTIALLY, THE ONLY ENTRY
INTO ISRAEL, THE ONLY ACCESS,
THE OPEN --
FROM ISRAEL AND THE OPEN STRIP
TO THE --
THAT HAMAS BLEW UP, WHEN IT
SENT IN ON SATURDAY MORNING IN
ORDER TO PUT, SHERPA, HEAD BURN,
AND BRUTALIZED ISRAELI'S.
THE ISRAELI DOES NOT HAVE AN
OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE
SUPPLYING THE RESOURCES THE
ENEMY NEEDS IN ORDER TO
CONTINUE ADVANCING ITS ASSAULT
AGAINST ISRAELI CIVILIANS, BUT
ALSO, THE SITUATION ON THE
GROUND IS SUCH THAT ISRAEL
CANNOT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED
TO DELIVERIES TO PORTER CROSSES
THAT NO LONGER EXIST.
>> EYLON LEVY, FOR THE ISRAELI
