South no arrives at the UN field
Hospital in Rafa it was a pretty heavy
Mission but we are really happy that it
was successful we already could evacuate
two patients last Saturday and we hope
that we can proceed like this because

doctors confirm no is critically ill
they'll transfer her to a hospital
abroad in the coming
days she has weak blood and has chest
infections as a result of the nature of

will receive full care and the necessary
medications doctors are confident that
with the Right medical treatment nor can
recover but there are many more
