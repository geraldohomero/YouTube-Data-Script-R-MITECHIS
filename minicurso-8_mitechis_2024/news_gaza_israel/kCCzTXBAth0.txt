have been multiple releases that
They arrived from the northern border to
High Galilee cities in the north of
Israel precisely most of these
launches were intercepted by
the iron dome the system of
defending
against Israel missiles but some
They managed to fall into open space inside
from Israel or even generated some
minor damage to cities and a person
As at least it was injured by remains
Of one of these impacts obviously
When the releases come from the
LEBANO The first thing that is thought of is
Hezbollah but at the moment no group
has assumed the responsibility of these
launches the channel wing the village
Saudi Arabia Channel Exit Fuentes
flying pointing that the Lebanese group
I would not be behind these releases
but rather grows the theory that
It could have been some Palestinian faction
that acts from that area of the
Lebanon
It was in the previous these releases
issue a statement by solidarity with
the Palestinians for the incursions
Two nights of police incursions
Israeli in the Alaxa mosque of
consecutive way and the Genopo Group
He said he was going to support all the measures
that they decided to take the groups of
Palestinians in this regard are expected
again that these tensions have to
be vigilant to what happens on
All night because after two
consecutive nights of incidents and
Also of launches from the strip
From Gaza the attention is high and from there
also that the Israeli government has
determined to summon your cabinet of
Security led by the first
Benjamin Minister after almost two
months without gathering tonight to
Analyze the security situation both
Here in Jerusalem like what is
happening from home and from Lebanon
