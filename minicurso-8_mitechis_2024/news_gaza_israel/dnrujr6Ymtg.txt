>> Aishah: HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S 
DAY 21 OF ISRAEL AT WAR.
THE IDF POUNDING HAMAS POINTS IN
GAZA.
THERE WAS A SECOND LIMITED 
INCURSION AHEAD OF A FULL SCALE 
GROUND INVASION.
TREY YENGST IS LIVE IN ISRAEL 
WHERE THE IDF IS CRANKING THINGS
UP.
WHAT DO YOU HEAR AND SEE?
>> ABSOLUTELY THE ISRAELI AIR 
FORCE HAS BEEN POUNDING THE 
NORTHERN PART OF THE GAZA STRIP 
TODAY.
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING AS THE 
STRIKES TAKE PLACE NOT JUST FROM
THE AIR BUT ALSO FROM THE GROUND
USING ARTILLERY UNITS ALONG THE 
BORDER TO HIT DIFFERENT ISLAMIC 
AND JIHAD CELLS WORKING TO CLEAR
A PATH TO HAVE GROUND TROOPS GO 
INTO GAZA ACCORDING TO THE 
DEFENSE MINISTER.
I SPOKE WITH HIM EARLIER TODAY.
THE ISRAELI PENTAGON IN TEL AVIV
IS WHERE I SPOKE TO HIM.
WE HAD A SMALL GROUPING.
A GROUP OF SIX JOURNALISTS AND 
THE DEFENSE MINISTER ASKING 
QUESTIONS AS THE WAR ENTERS THE 
21ST DAY.
ROCKETS WERE FIRED TOWARD TEL 
AVIV AFTER THE MEETING.
WHAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID, 
THE COUNTRY IS PREPARING FOR 
MONTHS OF WAR .  INSIDE GAZA.
HE WOULDN'T GIVE US A PRECISE 
DAY BUT SAID SOON ISRAELI FORCES
WILL ENTER THE GAZA STRIP AND 
TALKED ABOUT THE LEAD-UP TO THIS
AND DID NOT BELIEVE IRAN 
DIRECTLY ORDERED THE MASSACRE ON
OCTOBER 7TH BUT INDICATED THEY 
HAVE TRAINED AND SUPPLIED FUNDS 
TO HAMAS AND ISLAMIC JIHAD FOR 
YEARS.
I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS AND TALK 
ABOUT EASTERN SYRIA.
OVERNIGHT AMERICAN F-16s 
TARGETED IRANIAN PROXIES THERE.
THERE IS AN IRANIAN BASE IN 
EASTERN SYRIA THAT IN 2019 FOX 
NEWS USED CIVILIAN SATELLITES TO
LOCATE AFTER WE RECEIVED 
INTELLIGENCE FROM WESTERN 
SOURCES THAT INDICATED THE 
IRANIANS WILL START SUPPLYING 
WEAPONS TO THESE PROXIES.
NOW WE HAVE FOUR YEARS LATER AN 
INDICATION THAT THEY ARE USING 
THIS BASE TO LAUNCH ATTACKS 
AGAINST AMERICAN FORCES IN THE 
REGION AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY 
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ORDERED
THOSE STRIKES.
ON THE GROUND BETWEEN THE 
ISRAEL/GAZA BORDER WE UNDERSTAND
THE ISRAELIS WILL CONTINUE TO 
LAUNCH NIGHTLY RAIDS.
LAST NIGHT THEY USED THEIR NAVY 
TO LAUNCH A RAID IN SOUTHERN 
GAZA AND KILLED A NUMBER OF 
HAMAS MILITANTS THERE IN THE
