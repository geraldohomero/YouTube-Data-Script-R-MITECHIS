these mourners in gaza are waving the
black flag of the islamic jihad movement
in palestine
a top military commander of the group
was killed by an israeli airstrike on
tuesday morning
he was at home in gaza city when the
missiles hit before dawn
at 4 am around the time of dawn prayers
we heard the sound of the explosion i
lived next door i went out to check on
him i saw smoke rising and people and
resistance fighters were blocking the
road
the strike killed others alongside
including his wife in a joint news
conference with prime minister benjamin
netanyahu the chief of general staff of
the israeli defense forces said the
attack was necessary
this man was alive
even in recent days he worked and
planned attacks and was meaning to carry
them out
we tried to prevent his operation in
various ways but unsuccessfully
in the circumstances created we
recommend it to the politicians to
target him
the attack apparently wasn't the only
airstrike targeting the islamic jihad on
tuesday morning the group accuses israel
of targeting the home of its political
leader akramel ajuri in the syrian
capital of damascus al-azuri survived
but one of his sons was killed
our palestinian nation announces to
everyone that we will continue to fight
and will make this entity specifically
the mad netanyahu pay a high price and
we will continue to fight until we
destroy the occupation and free
palestine all of palestine islamic
jihad's response has been quick they've
fired numerous rockets into israel from
gaza
most have been intercepted by israel's
missile defense system
but some have landed
some observers worry this exchange will
lead to a new round of fighting in gaza
the strip is ruled by hamas islamic
jihad's rival but they will now face
pressure to respond to israel and that
could provoke a greater response from
israel and be a recipe for more
suffering in the small besieged
palestinian territory
