THE ISRAELI MILITARY NOW
STARTING TO BRING PEOPLE OUT OF
THAT TOWN, TRYING TO GET A
BETTER IDEA OF JUST HOW
WIDESPREAD THAT EVACUATION IS,
AND THE REASONS FOR IT.
KATIE, JONATHAN?
>> U.S. EMBASSIES OFFERING TO
EVACUATE AMERICANS BY SEA ON
MONDAY.
DO WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY
PEOPLE COULD BE EVACUATED, AND
WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE?
>> IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MANY
PEOPLE WILL FIT ON THAT SHIP.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID
THAT THIS WILL BE A FIRST COME
FIRST SERVE BASIS, IN TERMS OF
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO
EVACUATE IN THAT WAY.
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY
TOLD PEOPLE.
THEY NEED TO BE IN HAIFA, WHICH
IS A CITY IN THE NORTH, BY 8:00
IN THE MORNING.
NO PETS ALLOWED, YOU HAVE TO
SHOW PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP OR A
GREEN CARD, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE PASSAGE OR HAVE A VISA,
BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE U.S..
THEY WILL THEN MAKE A 10 TO
12-HOUR BOAT RIDE TO CYPRUS, AT
WHICH POINT THEY WILL BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING CARE OF
THEMSELVES.
THEY'LL HAVE TO ARRANGE THEIR
OWN HOUSING, ARRANGE THEIR OWN
OUTWARD TRAVEL TO THE UNITED
STATES TO GET BACK WHERE THEY
DECIDE TO GO.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THIS
ISN'T THE ONLY OPTION FOR
AMERICANS.
THERE IS NO CLEAR NUMBER OF
STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS HOW MANY
AMERICANS ARE DUAL CITIZENS IN
ISRAEL AND MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE.
THEY'RE MAKING THIS OPTION
AVAILABLE TO THOSE AMERICANS
WHO DO WANT TO GO.
WE KNOW THAT FLIGHTS ARE
EXTREMELY RESTRICTED HERE, MANY
AIRLINES HAVE CANCELED FLIGHTS
AND HAVE STOPPED FLYING HERE,
INCLUDING THE MAJOR U.S.
AIRLINES.
SO THIS IS YET ANOTHER OPTION
FOR AMERICANS WHO WANT TO
LEAVE.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAYS
THAT THEY WILL STILL MAKE
CHARTER FLIGHTS AVAILABLE ON AN
AS THE BASIS, BUT IT'S NOT
CLEAR WHEN THAT MIGHT HAPPEN.
FOR NOW, THE OPTION FOR
AMERICANS HERE IS TO GO BY
BOAT.
THAT'S FROM HAIFA, A CITY TO
