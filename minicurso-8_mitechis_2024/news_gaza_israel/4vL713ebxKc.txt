Israeli National Security Council continues
Advisory of Israeli living abroad
NSC can be attacked by citizens
Citizens living abroad were said from side
Israeli citizens remained alert to be vigilant
Has been warned of A Allah
Akbar Allah
Akbar see citizens living abroad
India has been asked to stay there
Advisory has also been issued on behalf of
Indians are living in Israel and without work
We should not be cautious from our homes
Along with special guests are also connected with whom
We are discussing Asthana sir how you
Seeing because it's okay Mossad's
Things are happening again and again that Mossad is not there
Somewhere the security agency is an intelligence agency
How did his inputs prove to be failed
The water of Hamas fought all three
Managed to infiltrate the fronts and
After that, such a big we are untouched
What is the picture ahead
Look at you, I have a fan
Obviously it is seen in front but
If I see it in strategic language most
The big thing is that we felt something
In time, Arab countries with Israel
Going close to him
If you have to stop in a manner, then Palestine
Which is the cose and what is their voice probably buried
Go and there are many countries that this alliance
From which Arab countries are happening with Israel
He was not happy, that's why they also support
Came and this has carried out such a big action
Completely come forward to do the ability to give
And this support is also an external hand
There is also silent hand and as far as mine
Idea is that financial support is also left
Is also from other countries that are not happy with this thing
Was that which is this Aut Uut Record or which one
Corridor was becoming India and European countries
Middle East and Israel and Europe
The corridor was not happy with it
So strategically, this is a big one of this
See it on the big table and Russia
The world already divided due to Ukraine war
It was seen and now in the middle East too
A new war front has opened Arab countries
What will be the attitude of this time
But we will also keep an eye because Saudi Arabia
Anyway, he pulled back from the deal
Hai stands with Hamas at the moment
Looks against Israel
