ISRAEL IN SUPPRESSING THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE FOR
GENERATIONS.
>> MATT BRADLEY FROM LEBANON,
THANK YOU.
>>> LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN
AMERICA ALSO ON HIGH ALERT IN
THE WAKE OF THE ISRAEL HAMAS
WAR.
FBI DIRECTOR SAYS THAT HIS
AGENCY IS LASER FOCUSED ON
MITIGATING THREATS.
IN NEW YORK CITY, POLICE ARE
BEEPING OF SECURITY MEASURES
WITH DEMONSTRATIONS THAT TAKE
PLACE NEARLY EVERYDAY.
TOM WINTERS JOINS US NOW.
TOM, WHAT EXACTLY IS THE NYPD
DOING AND WHAT ARE WE HEARING
AROUND THE COUNTRY?
>> IN NEW YORK, ALL OFFICERS
HAVE TO BE IN UNIFORM AND THAT
IS REALLY TO HAVE THE ABILITY
TO NOT ONLY SEND OFFICERS OUT
OF THE CLAIMANT AT ANY GIVEN
TIME, BUT ALSO TO HAVE THEM IN
FRONT OF HOUSES OF WORSHIP AND
PUBLIC PLACES WE ARE SEEING THE
SAME THING IN LOS ANGELES WITH
A POLICE PRESENCE WITH
SYNAGOGUE.

EXTRAORDINARY MEETING WITH AN
INTELLIGENCE COLLABORATOR THAT
OCCURRED IN SAN FRANCISCO.

PLANNED TO TALK ABOUT THREATS
FROM CHINA, BUT THEY ALSO SPOKE
ABOUT THESE ON GOING THREATS

ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND WE HAVE
SEEN THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY
OCCUR AND WHEN THOSE HAVE BEEN
MADE, THEY TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN

OFFICIALS HERE AND THERE
CONCERNED.

>> THE HARDEST THING TO TRY TO
FIND AND SOMEONE WHO HAS
ENGAGED IN ALL OF THIS
RHETORIC, AND LISTENING TO
THOSE CALLS ARE REFERENCED.
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. HOW DO
YOU POSSIBLY PREDICT WHEN
SOMEONE WILL DO THAT.
