In fact, especially for the strip of
Gaza in fact will have meetings with
Benjam√≠n Nanaho Prime Minister
In Tel Aviv and in fact also the

Something to the Security Council of the
United Nations but let's go for
Parts told them is the sixth tour

Between Morocco and Israel among others
But well negotiations in this
