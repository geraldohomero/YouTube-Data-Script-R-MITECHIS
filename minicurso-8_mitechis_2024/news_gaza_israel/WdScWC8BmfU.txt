The Israeli army said on Saturday (Oct 14) that 
it was investigating an incident in southern  
Lebanon in which a Reuters journalist 
was killed and six others injured.
A military spokesman said the death of 
Issam Abdallah was, quote, "a tragic thing."
A Reuters videographer who was at the scene on  
Friday said missiles fired from the 
direction of Israel struck the group.
Alongside journalists from Al Jazeera 
and AFP, the Reuters team was providing  
a live video signal for broadcasters near 
Alma al-Shaab, close to the Israel border
where the Israeli military and 
Lebanese militia Hezbollah have  
been trading fire in border clashes.
While other news outlets, including the Associated 
Press and Al Jazeera, said the missiles which  
killed Issam Abdallah were Israeli, Reuters could 
not establish whether they were fired by Israel.
Israel’s UN envoy, Gilad Erdan spoke 
to reporters at a briefing on Friday.
"Obviously, we would never want to hit 
or kill or shoot any journalist that is  
doing his job. But, you know, we're in 
a state of war. Things might happen."
UN Secretary-General Antonio 
Guterres said the incident  
underlines the danger of the conflict 
spreading, and the risks to reporters.
"I want to say how much this demonstrates the 
enormous risk of spillover of this conflict,  
namely in relation to Lebanon. And I want to 
pay tribute to the journalists that so many,  
unfortunately, the largest number ever last year,  
so many journalists are paying with their 
lives. The work they do, to bring truth to  
everybody in the world and I present to 
their families my deepest condolences."
The two other Reuters journalists, Thaer Al-Sudani 
and Maher Nazeh who were wounded in the incident,  
were released from a hospital 
after receiving medical care.
