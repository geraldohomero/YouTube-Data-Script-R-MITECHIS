NYPD WILL REASSESS THE RESPONSE
ON MONDAY. CHRISTINA FAN, CBS 2
NEWS.
>> THANK YOU. THE DEADLINE FOR
THE 1 MILLION PALESTINIANS TO
EVE ARCUATE NORTHERN GAZA HAS
COME AND GONE.
>> MASS EVACUATIONS ARE AHEAD
OF WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A
MAJOR GROUND OPERATION FROM
ISRAELI MILITARY. IAN LEE JOINS
US LIVE FROM TEL AVIV. WHAT IS
>> Reporter: HI DOUG AND
ANDREA. PALESTINIANS ARE TRYING
TO MOVE SOUTH WHETHER BY CAR,
THEY CAN GET TO SAFETY. STILL
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
REMAINING IN GAZA CITY, GOING
TO MAKE A DIFFICULT SITUATION
RESEND THE ORDER SENDING PEOPLE
DOWN SOUTH BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE
THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT
EXISTS A LOT MORE COMPLICATED.
WE KNOW SOME FOREIGNERS HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO GET TO EGYPT
ACROSS THE BORDER CROSSING BUT
THOSE ARE JUST A FEW PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TO
SAFETY. THE MAJORITY ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO SIT TIGHT WHEREVER
THEY ARE AS THIS OPERATION
ISRAEL HAS BEEN SAYING IS
COMING AS IT GETS UNDERWAY.
NOW, THERE WAS A WINDOW FOR

TARGETING MILITANTS AND ALSO
LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE
BEEN KIDNAPPED DURING THAT RAID
THAT IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR
ISRAELIS. WE HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF ISRAELI
SOLDIERS ALONG THE BORDER. WE
HAVE SEEN TANKS, ARMOR
PERSONNEL CARRIERS. THESE ARE
CRUCIAL FOR A GROUND INVASION
WHICH ISRAEL SAYS IS GOING TO
HAPPEN. WE ARE WAITING FOR THAT
OVER A WEEK TO GET EVERYTHING
IN POSITION BEFORE THAT
INVASION HAPPENED. IT WOULD BE
A FEW MORE DAYS IF THAT IS THE
SAME TIME LINE WE ARE
