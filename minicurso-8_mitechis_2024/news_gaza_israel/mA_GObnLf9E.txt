vote of a permanent member of the
council I now give the floor to those
members of the council who wish to make
statements after the vote I give the
floor to the representative of the
United
States thank you madam
president colleagues over the past few
weeks we have made incredibly clear that
the resolution before the council would
not achieve the goal of a sustainable
peace and may in fact run counter to it
proceeding with a vote today was wishful
and
irresponsible and so while we cannot
support a resolution that would put
sensitive negotiations in Jeopardy we
look forward to engaging on a text that
we believe will address so many of the
concerns we all share a text that can
can and should be adopted by the council
so that we can have a temporary
ceasefire as soon as practicable based
on the formula of all hostages being
released this temporary ceasefire is
critical to getting Aid into the hands
of Palestinian civilians who
desperately desperately need
it we should look towards this text so
that we can finally finally condemn
Hamas for their horrific attacks on
October 7th which set this conflict in
to motion so that we can Empower senior
coordinator Cog and the United Nations
because her success is the UN
success and it is so very needed to
ensure civilians get the aid that they
need more efficiently and effectively
and just more period
and so that ultimately we can together
help create a future in which Israelis
and Palestinians live in states of their
own side by side in peace we're
committed to engaging constructively on
our resolution with you all in the days
to come to that end and we will continue
to tirelessly engage in direct diplomacy
and negotiations on the ground thank you
