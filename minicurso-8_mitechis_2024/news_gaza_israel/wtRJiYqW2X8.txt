And for the first time from the start
of the war in Gaza the United States ready
to sanction Israeli soldiers from
members of the Nea Yehouda battalion are
suspected of having committed abuses
On Palestinians hello to you
Stéphane Amar you are in Jerusalem for
France 24 First Stéphane
Explain to us what military unit
We then speak Netzar Yuda it is a
a little special battalion that has
been created at destination of soldiers
often orthodox religious
that is to say very religious because
You know that traditionally and
well the Orthodox refuses to do
the army in Israel there was an agreement to
beginning of the creation of this state in
the 1950s to allow and well
Most students from Yeshiva C
Telmudic academy of being exempt from
military service and then over the
years and well some of them have
wanted to integrate the army there is also
Pressure from society so that it
do the army and therefore there are
Battalions a little special
Commearoda who were created where he
there are only men and where the rules
religious food rules
prayer rules and this are
respect to the letter and therefore
allow these Orthodox soldiers to
do their military service and
The occurrence of this Desar Lehoua battalion
essentially operates in what
Call here Samaria Judea
that is to say the Jordan S Jordan
So occupied the Hebrew state Stéphan says
do not be aware of the sanctions to
come is it a posture
In any case there is a certain
unanimity to refuse the prospect of
These sanctions because Benjamin Etanou
expressed himself on his information
reporting possible sanctions
against these soldiers but also
Benigand who is his political opponent
He centrist and who said he was
also scandalized by the perspective
of American sanction so I would say
that when it comes to the army there is
a form of sacred union in Israel a
common front of the right of a good
part of the left to defend the
soldiers and to defend integrity
morality of soldiers who is questioned
by the Americans thank you very much
Stéphane Stéphane Amar live from
