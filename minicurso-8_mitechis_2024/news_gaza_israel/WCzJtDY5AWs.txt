JOINS MEET THE PRESS  AS ITS
NEW MODERATOR.
SUNDAYS ON NBC.
>> WELCOME BACK TO NBC NEWS
DAILY.
WE WILL CONTINUE COVERAGE OF
THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR.
JOSH, WE SAW THE RELEASE OF TWO
AMERICAN HOSTAGES ON FRIDAY.
WHAT ARE WE HEARING?
I KNOW RICHARD ENGEL REPORTED
URGENT RELEASE OF THE TWO.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
YOU MET ALL WE KNOW IS THAT
HAMAS SAID THEY WERE RELEASED
ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS.
HAMAS HAS MADE A NUMBER OF
STATEMENTS ABOUT THESE HOSTAGES
THAT HAVE PROVEN TO BE FALSE.
TAKE THAT WITH A MAJOR GRAIN OF
SALT.
IT ALSO SEEMS VERY POSSIBLE
THAT HAMAS  IS RELEASING THESE
IN ORDER TO TRY TO SAVE OFF
THAT GROUND INCURSION THAT THEY
HAVE BEEN PROMISING FOR OVER A
WEEK NOW.
REMEMBER, HAMAS HAS PUT OUT
STATEMENTS THROUGH THEIR
MILITANT WINGS , AL-QASSAM
BRIGADES, SAYING THEY WERE
READY TO CLOSE THEM,  RELEASING
ALL THE CIVILIANS IN GAZA RIGHT
NOW IF ISRAEL WOULD HALT
AIRSTRIKES AND HAVE A CEASE-
FIRE.
ISRAEL HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IS
NOT ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.
THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE A
STRATEGY BY HAMAS  TO TRY TO
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT, LOOK, IF
ISRAEL WALKS US BACK A BIT,
HOLD OFF FROM THE GROUND
INCURSION, THERE IS A
POSSIBILITY OF GETTING HOSTAGES
OUT.
NBC NEWS HAS REPORTED BASED ON
FOUR U.S. OFFICIALS THAT ONE OF
THE REASONS THEY ARE NOW
ENCOURAGING ISRAEL TO HOLD OFF
ON A GROUND INCURSION IS
BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT
DOING SO COULD INCREASE THE
POSSIBILITY OF GETTING MORE
HOSTAGES, INCLUDING 10 AMERICAN
CITIZENS, SAFELY OUT OF THE
STRIP.
WE CANNOT CONFIRM THAT THESE
TWO ELDERLY ISRAELI WOMEN HAVE
MADE IT SAFELY OUT OF THE GAZA
STRIP.
WE KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED
FROM HAMAS CUSTODY,  ACCORDING
TO MULTIPLE ISRAELI OFFICIALS,
THE RED CROSS, AS WELL AS THE
FAMILY IS ONE OF THEM.
THIS WILL FOLLOW THE SAME
FORMAT AS THE LAST HOSTAGE
RELEASE, THAT AFTER ARRIVING AT
THE BORDER, THEY WOULD BE MET
BY ISRAELI OFFICIALS WHO WOULD
BRING THEM TO A SAFE LOCATION
TO BE REUNITED WITH FAMILY AND
FRIENDS, UNDERGOING MEDICAL AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS.
THEIR FAMILIES, OFFICIALS AND
OTHERS ARE WAITING TO SEE THEM
