>> GIVEN THE IMMENSE SCALE OF
SUFFERING IN GAZA, THERE MUST BE
AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE!
>> Steve: FOX NEWS ALERT, THAT
WAS VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS
TAKING A CLEAR STANCE ON ISRAELS
WAR OVER THE WEEKEND CALLING FOR
AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE AS THE
COUNTRY IS REPORTEDLY BOYCOTTING
GAZA CEASE-FIRE TALKS IN CAIRO.
LIVE IN TEL AVIV, TREY GOWDY.
>> HEY, GOOD MORNING.
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER
PRESIDENT BIDEN EATING ICE CREAM
SAYING HE HOPED FOR A CEASE-FIRE
BY MONDAY.
IT IS MONDAY AND THERE IS NO
CEASE-FIRE.
HOWEVER, WE DO UNDERSTAND THERE
IS A DELEGATION OF HAMAS
DELEGATIONS IN CAIRO AND ARRIVED
YESTERDAY TO CONTINUE THOSE
CONVERSATIONS APPEAR AT THE
ISRAELI TEAM DID NOT SEND THEIR
DELEGATION.
BEFORE THE MEETINGS TOOK PLACE,
THOUSANDS MARCHED IN HIS OR HER
CALLING FOR LOVED ONES AND
FELLOW CITIZENS TO BE RELEASED.
THEY WERE DISAGREEMENTS OVER
WHAT INFORMATION HAMAS IS TO
PROVIDE.
LOOKING FOR A LIST OF ALL
HOSTAGES THAT ARE STILL ALIVE.
EGYPTIAN STATE MEDIA SAID
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN
MADE TOWARD A CEASE-FIRE THAT
WOULD INCLUDE SIX-WEEK POSITIVE
FIGHTING AND RELEASE OF SOME
HOSTAGES.
ISRAEL WILL HAVE TO RELEASE
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AS ANY
AGREEMENT.
THE CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING
PLACE AS THE HOLY MONTH OF
RAMADAN SET TO BEGIN THIS
WEEKEND.
THE HOLIDAY HAS TRADITIONALLY
LED TO TENSION AND ESCALATION
ACROSS THE REGION.
150 DAYS IN THE CONFLICT AND
HAMAS, PRESSURE IS MOUNTING TO
GET A DEAL IN PLACE.
ISRAEL EXPECTED TO ENTER PUTIN
CITY OF ROTH THAT IF THE
NEGOTIATIONS FELL APART.
OVER THE WEEKEND THE
UNITED STATES CONDUCTED AIR
DROPS DELIVERING 38,000 MEALS TO
PALESTINIANS IN NEED.
SIMILAR AIR DROPS ARE EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS
IN THE CONVERSATIONS TAKING
PLACE IN CAIRO, MAINLY CONCERNED
THAT IF THEY DO NOT SUCCEED TO
THEM A BROADER WORK COULD ERUPT
IN THE REGION.
REMEMBER THE LEBANESE MILITANT
GROUP HEZBOLLAH IS INVOLVED IN
THE FIGHT AND KILLED ONE
CIVILIAN ALONG ISRAEL'S NORTHE
