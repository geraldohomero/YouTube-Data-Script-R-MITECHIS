fire in London around 100,000 have
marched most Saturdays mainly young many
from the UK's Muslim Community and from
the political left we can only hope like
we can we just have to keep going until
they do um there's power in people
there's so many people here and we just
have to keep going until they do listen
it's a Bloodshed and the Israelis are
targeting hospitals schools and you
can't we can't we can't stand by and
just watch
this it's been the same story in Berlin
and Paris and elsewhere there have been
isolated arrests for outright support of
Hamas but the demonstrations have still
continued meanwhile there's been a sharp
rise in both anti-semitic and
islamophobic incidents across Europe
leaving Jewish and some Muslim
communities feeling increasingly
threatened in the immediate aftermath of
hamas's attack on October the 7th
European governments rushed to support
Israel's right to defend itself while
while expressing concern over Regional
escalation despite the street protests
that hasn't
changed but as the Palestinian civilian
death toll Rises Europe's governments
have increased their calls for pause or
ceasefire to allow for greater
humanitarian Aid the EU is now the
biggest donor to the Palestinians and
this week announced another increase of
$27 million but concern for the
Palestinians is still tempered by
support for Israel's ambition to destroy
Hamas all of
us as
democracies and as human
beings have a responsibility do
everything possible to protect civilians
who are Caught In Harm's
Way so while Israel has the right to
fight Hamas it is also
essential that it strives to avoid
civilian
casualties and to be as targeted as
possible
because every human life
matters be it Israeli or
Palestinian the crisis in the Middle
East is creating real political tensions
in Europe governments of all political
complexions are struggling to steer a
path between historic support for Israel
and Rising domestic anger at the price
being paid by Palestinian
civilians
