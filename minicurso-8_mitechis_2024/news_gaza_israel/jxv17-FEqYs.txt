what's a standard commute for many is
risky for mohammed
he's one of many palestinians who go to
israel from the occupied west bank every
day without a work permit
muhammad studying nursing at the
university of ramallah
but to pay for his education and support
his family he needs a job that pays more
than he can make in the occupied west
bank
wages are better on the israeli side
there i can earn 69 a day whereas in the
west bank i can't get more than twenty
four dollars a day
when there's work muhammad pays a
smuggler 28 dollars to drop him off at
an opening in the border wall and
crosses over with the help of spotters
on the israeli side
if caught he faces deportation or prison
time
but he also risks being shot by israeli
soldiers
if we make it across there are cars
waiting for us it normally costs three
dollars to get to the workshop but since
we are there illegally they charge us
more in total it cost me 36 to get to
work on the way home it's another 28
dollars to get smuggled back to the
green line
and one in every five palestinians is
living on less than five and a half
dollars a day
analysts say israel's economic siege
makes jobs hard to come by
and so palestinians are forced to look
for work elsewhere
the international labor organization
estimates that more than 131 thousand
palestinians worked in israel in 2017
but rights activists say securing a
permit is very difficult
a palestinian can't have a previous
arrest record related to any anti-israel
activities including protests
there are other conditions such as being
married
plus the employer in israel must have
official paperwork that verifies the
palestinian employee is not involved in
the resistance against israel in any way
for palestinians like muhammad work
means survival even at the cost of
imprisonment and possible death auba de
hito trt world
