Rajel starts traces of ornaments from the
Sucot the Jewish party that culminated hours
before 7
October says the year will start with
Blessings but well came a
War months later his home exhibits
The wounds of the attacks ever here
He hid a day and a half until
managed to flee from the
city usually when there are alerts
I take my car and Alejo per
Inal terrorists we could leave although
It is still evacuated by the damage of a
rocket launched from Gaza has resumed the
Teaching and several
Volunteers before returning was
devastated I didn't know what was going to happen
When I returned to work and I saw what
I was happening I felt something else
relieved but my situation is very
difficult is like not having a
Home as Ragel about 26000 of 36000
inhabitants have returned to es Derot little
traffic and bass those are part of
The new life in the last city
Israeli to which the militants arrived
Moti reopened his restaurant only tr
weeks but already suffers from the lack of
staff ensures that your business barely
survived with state assistance
And donations from
relatives some of the people who
They work with me have not yet returned
For them it is very difficult to return
We received state aid but they arrived
late and not enough until
Now I have only received payments that cover
around 60 or 70 for what
I need part of Moti's income
They come today from groups that come to this
Drot to raise awareness about 7
October is the case of these students
high school that runs through the memorial
Next to the police station that was
20 hours of fighting with 35
agents and civilians
dead we want to remember all
fallen soldiers and people
murdered by terrorists their souls
They are here and will always be with
We are the mood in is Drot that
Drag the trauma and loss of 70 of
Its yah citizens
