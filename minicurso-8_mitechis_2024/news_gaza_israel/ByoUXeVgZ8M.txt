NATIONALS AND FILIPINO NATIONALS
WERE ALSO KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS ON
THE 7th, THEY WERE RELEASED AS
WELL.
ALL OF THESE HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN
THROUGH A TERRIBLE OR DEAL.
AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A
LONG JOURNEY OF HEALING FOR
THEM.
THE TEDDY BEARS WAITING TO GREET
THOSE CHILDREN AT THE HOSPITAL
ARE A STARK REMINDER OF THE
TRAUMA THESE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN
THROUGH.
AND AT SUCH A VERY YOUNG AGE.
JILL AND I ARE KEEPING THEM ALL
IN OUR PRAYERS TODAY.
TODAY, TODAY HAS BEEN A PRODUCT
OF A LOT OF HARD WORK AND WEEKS
OF PERSONAL ENGAGEMENT.
FROM THE MOMENT HAMAS KIDNAPPED
THESE PEOPLE, I ALONG WITH MY
TEAM HAVE WORKED AROUND THE
CLOCK TO SECURE THEIR RELEASE.
WE SAW THE FIRST RESULTS OF THIS
EFFORT WITH THE RELEASE OF TWO
AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN LATE
OCTOBER.
FOLLOWED BY THE RELEASE OF TWO
ISRAELI HOSTAGES.
I CONSISTENTLY PRESSED FOR A
PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING.
FOR TWO REASONS.
TO ACCELERATE AND EXPAND THE
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE GOING
INTO GAZA.
AND TWO, TO FACILITATE THE
RELEASE OF HOSTAGES.
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS,
I'VE SPOKEN REPEATEDLY WITH THE
QATAR AND THE PRIME MINISTER
NETANYAHU OF ISRAEL, TO HELP
SECURE THIS DEAL, TO NAIL IT
DOWN.
AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THREE
LEADERS FOR THEIR PERSONAL
PARTNERSHIP TO GET THIS DONE.
PARTNERSHIP TO GET THIS DONE.
I SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT, THE
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU TO
CONFIRM THE ELEMENTS OF THE
ENGAGEMENT.
AS I SAID, TODAY'S RELEASE ARE
THE START OF A PROCESS.
WE EXPECT MORE HOSTAGES TO BE
RELEASED TOMORROW.
AND MORE THE DAY AFTER, AND MORE
THE DAY AFTER THAT.
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE
EXPECT THAT DOZENS OF HOSTAGES
WILL BE RETURNED TO THEIR
FAMILIES.
AND ALSO REMEMBER ALL OF THOSE
WHO ARE STILL BEING HELD.
AND RENEW OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK
FOR THEIR RELEASE AS WELL.
TWO AMERICAN WOMEN AND ONE
4-YEAR-OLD CHILD, ABIGAIL, WHO
REMAINS AMONG THOSE MISSING.
WE ALSO WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE
GET THESE HOSTAGES BROUGHT HOME.
AND AN ANSWER TO THEIR
WHERE-ABOUTS.
