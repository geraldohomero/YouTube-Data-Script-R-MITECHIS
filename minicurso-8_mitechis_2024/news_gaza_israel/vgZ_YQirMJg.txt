it's kind of hard to wrap your head
around a situation like this um trying
to focus on the
positive um you know the hoping
everybody is um safe to some degree
and and is being kept healthy and we're
hoping to see them soon as we can but uh
every person that comes home is
a is is a huge
thing uh we're very hopeful that uh
alenna will be released in this um in
the ceasefire
um it's it's a very important start for
us um and we're very hopeful to see them
home soon uh one side I'm I'm happy
second uh I'm I'm worried okay because
uh nobody told me that my uh family will
be this in this uh this uh deal okay
there was 40 children in inside Gaza and
they go to R only 30
where are the others I don't know and I
hope that everybody will release until
all those hes will release we didn't we
didn't stop we continue day day on day
off uh to protect uh the right of the
hostages it's terrible 7 weeks it's I
think it's never happened in in in my
life for sure but uh in in in the
history of the
uh human being like too many hostages
too many children too many babies too
many
women um I don't know how I feel right
now I want to be sure that my family
will
release at least the the grandsons and
the my daughter low and I go to hug them
kiss them and I hope they and probably
they will be in hospital in the in the
first time to get the checkup and
everything but uh I don't know I don't
know I didn't think what I got to do and
what I going to
say I'm not counting hostages being
freed in this deal until I see them walk
over the border and be embraced
safely and
then God willing these 50 hostages are
released that's still still leaves
another 190 hostages that need to be
released my heart has been buried in
Gaza and every day I change the
number and I pray and hope that the
world will help all of us get our hearts
out of
Gaza and I also worry for the other
innocent people who are in Gaza also
suffering on the other side
there are good innocent Palestinian
people who are also there and we are
aware of
that
