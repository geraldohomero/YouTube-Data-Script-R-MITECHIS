We are going to link to Nuria Grio now
In special life in Israel Nuria
How good good morning here in the
Mexico City Good afternoon in
Israel and Nuria talk about what has
happened in the last hours there in
Gaza How Raimundo very good afternoon
From here from Telavi then look after
Several days of siege near the hospital
from alifa the great unknown not the great
Question what everyone did here was yes
Finally the army was going to occupy this
Hospital and as you explained
Also from the study this has happened
It has happened at dawn on Tuesday
Of course this operation has taken it to
carried out with the approval of states
United Raimundo because the United States
that asked the Israeli army was that
made this occupation without bombing
aerial without fire and finally eh
Tanks and
soldiers have broken into this hospital
Recall that in this hospital they continue
having many patients
displaced eh by bombings and
health personnel and what is happening
right now there as the
information that is coming to us
Raimundo is that they are producing
interrogations that soldiers are
Making records in basements in basements
Because what they say from here is that the
information that has given them their
Intelligence is that it is in the subsoil of
That hospital where the center of
ever command and that is why they have
carried out this operation but what
Soldiers burst into a Rayford Hospital
You can imagine that he has taxed
Much more eh the situation
director of this hospital what is
Saying is that patients are eh
Fearful remember that there are babies
premature and very worry life
of them and also of the rest of
patients the Israeli army for the moment
has transferred some
Images eh themselves entering
food and health material to this
Point but eh rights organizations
Humans are saying that what is
passing are war crimes so
This is a bit the situation right now
Eh raimundo seems that this war goes
to lengthen and the Israeli army is
convinced that as he said he is
The command center and let's see if
length of the day there are more information than
that there are there inside that hospital and
what are now the plans eh of the
Israeli army very good nuria
Thank you very much for a report
