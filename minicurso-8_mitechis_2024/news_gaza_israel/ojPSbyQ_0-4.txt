And we show you now how you live week
Santa in the old city of Jerusalem
With stores closed an atypical postcard
For this height of the year and of course
Cause a certain shudder between
Not only the transgatters but also
the merchants because they live
harshly in impacts on these
These lands is Holy Week and the
Old city of Jerusalem is
practically empty as they see in images
At this time this due to the impact of
The war in the Gaza Strip
Obviously shops are seen stores with
Few clients and also few
pilgrims while the Palestinians
Christians many residents in C
Jordan did not obtain permits to
Visit the Holy City some stores
they have the
Eh the opposite bolt is
completely closed and also for being
The month of Ramadan is another of the
issues and
Eh them
sellers are there passing
hours in stores and look at
The very few tourists who pass the
majority without buying
Nothing this
Clearly talks about what is lived
closely in the Middle East how it impacts
the
War also in
merchants in this war have already died
about 32500 Palestinians unfortunately
This caused Christian tourism and
Pilgrimages also to Holy Land
No
E are not even recovered
After the pandemic they could not
recover and reduced minimal
This speaks
Obviously of the miseries no
that are lived at the moment
there because in others
contexts these same halls and
staircases were very very very
crowded by tourists in a
so significant time also so
symbolic as is Holy Week for
Jerusalem but unfortunately
Not even the
history is
A call for tourists
because the conditions are not given or
at least
It is a clear example of the war
impacts beyond not
developing in this territory in the
