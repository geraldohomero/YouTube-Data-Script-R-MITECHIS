This battle for the city of Abdc in the
Donesk province in the Donbas makes
remember a lot to what was lived by the
neighboring city of Batmud that fell into
Control of Moscow forces in May
After the city of Abdc is also
practically destroyed because it comes
being attacked not only since the beginning
of October when this began
Russian offensive but it has been
attacked from the beginning of the invasion
On a large scale and this extends even
until 2014 when the forces
separatists supported by Moscow they took
The control of part of that area of the country
ABA is very close to the city of gifts
In control of these separatist forces
since then according to the police and the
volunteers who reach the city
There is still a corridor for which
They can enter there are 1000 people
And as happened in Bmou most them
They are older people who refuse to
Leave the city but every time they live in
more difficult but many circumstances
of them despite the
insistence they deny abandon and this
Although bombings and
attacks are growing according to
Ukrainian forces what do the
Russian forces are trying to surround the
City The Ukrainians are defending
With artillery and this has made
Avoid the arrival of Russian forces
especially have destroyed at least 100
Tanks and transport vehicles
armored and too
They have ended with large waves of
men commanded by Russian forces
that are increasingly looking for new
alternatives how to get there for example
There is already talk of tunnels that have ended
trying to reach positions
Ukrainian or use some robots some
robots cars that take ammunition
as far as they are located on the front
But as this said before
had great human losses and
Materials for Russia but also for
Ukraine as soldiers have said that
They are in the front that say the
situation although they maintain it and
defend is very difficult
