So let me tell you the northern of Gaza Strip
Nearly Israeli army completes in the area
Now occupied in one house
Searching is going on by entering the Israeli army
Large number before reaching the city
In Palestinian southern gaz
There are more than 50000 in a day tomorrow
Palestinian is killed in Southern Gaza
Now America is afraid that Israel
Somewhere permanent control over the gazelle
Do not do it and this fear is because Gaz
Israeli army entered into continuously
To eliminate the month of Hama
Israel's army made that Gaza Strip
Parted and captured where ever
People of Palestine roam freely
Were but now that side of the sea is Israeli
Arrived in the army of the army
But in the meantime, Israeli army's action
The plan has surfaced under which in Gaza
Israel's army takes action against Hamas
Wali
Hai is the place of the sea of Gaza
Rashid Street is usually quite a walk here
Used to live but now it is the Sahil of the sea
Is in Sai and Israel's army here
Paid on the waves of the sea
These are the weapons of Gaza
Humas has come to the fore
Used to occupy the dreaded commanders
Now Israel's army ha Israel is still there
Around 1500 hand grenade 760 RPG 427
Explosive belt and 106 rockets from this area
Has recovered
But the most important thing is that Israel
Killed Hamas's rocket man
Terrorist Mohsin Abu Jina was dropped by Hamas
Abu Jina was called rocket man of Hamas
Jina was the chief of the rocket factory
I would be made dangerous weapons and rockets
More than 1000 terrorists of Hamas and 20
Most big commanders are piled up
Israel entered Gaza and Hamas
No terrorists and its commanders
Killed but also destroy the tunnels of Hamas
Gave
In such a situation, the question arises whether
Sis fire only because of Hamas's broken waist
Demand
Lagged
