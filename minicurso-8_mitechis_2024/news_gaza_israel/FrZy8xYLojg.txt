[CC may contain inaccuracies] It is unfortunate that we are meeting at
a time of heightened crisis around the
world, certainly in the Middle East,
where I come from, where we're troubled
that we're pained by the suffering of
the human level.
And because as much as we
we're pained by by the losses of life on
the other side on October seven.
But through this crisis, through the
crisis in Europe, through multiple other
hotspots around the world, we see
through them hopefully towards a better
future.
And I think we in Saudi Arabia
are focusing on our long term objectives
of creating prosperity and creating an
example in the Middle East and the
broader areas around us.
We're focused on the betterment of
people.
There's much better alternative than
ideological tension
and conflict.
We're the ones neighbors.
Going back to the bigger question on on
the China
US relationships.
I agree with you, Stephanie, that
pragmatism is surfacing.
We heard it from the vice president
today,
a call for collaboration and coexistence
between the world's two economic
superpower and geopolitical
powers
as well, from the regional transition to
a region of prosperity.
I think it reminds us of something that
has existed in the Middle East for many,
many decades, since the 1940s, which is
a big part of the Middle East.
The Palestinian people have had their
basic rights
taken away and their right for statehood
and peaceful existence unfulfilled.
And it's time to use this awful
situation now to bring that to the fore
and to resolve it.
Saudi Arabia has put forward the Arab
peace plan for a long time,
and we remain
eager to see that plan coming to
fruition through a peaceful process.
You will see this week, in the next few
days, Saudi Arabia convening an
emergency Arab summit in Riyadh.
You will see Saudi Arabia convening and
Africa Saudi summit and that and in a
few days you will see Saudi Arabia
convening an Islamic.
Summer.
And in the short term, the objective of
bringing
these three summits and other gatherings
under the leadership of Saudi Arabia
would be to drive towards peaceful
resolution of the conflict.
