THESE ALSO OF COURSE,
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY LEADER --
JAKE SULLIVAN MET WITH HIM
TODAY AND THAT IS A CONTINUING
PROBLEM BECAUSE WHO WILL LEAVE
THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY?
WHO WILL LEAD THE WEST BANK?
THEY SAY A POST SHOULD
EVENTUALLY GOVERN GAZA AFTER
HAMAS IS ELIMINATED BUT
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU OPPOSES
THAT.
CRITICS SAY HE'S -- HOPING THEY
WOULD GET HIM RE-ELECT AND
DELAY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE
OCTOBER 7th INTELLIGENCE
FAILURE.
FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.
SAYS THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO
BEGIN MY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS
WANT TO ASK ABOUT THAT.
HOW MUCH OF THIS MANEUVERING
HAS TO DO WITH THE POLITICAL
SITUATION?
>> 101% ANDREA.
SINCE 629 A.M.
ON SATURDAY, OVER SEVEN -- HAS
BEEN DOING NOTHING BUT TRYING TO
MANAGE HIS POLITICAL ROLE
SURVIVABILITY.
THIS HAS TO DO WITH BLAMING THE
MILITARY.
BLAMING THE GENERAL SECURITY
SERVICE, THAT SHE BOUGHT,
BLAMING IMPLICITLY THE U.S.,
PRESIDENT BIDEN.
BLAMING EVERYONE BUT HIMSELF.
ALL HE IS DOING NOW IS ABOUT
POLITICAL SURVIVABILITY.
THAT BEING ESTABLISHED DOESN'T
MEAN THAT THERE'S NO JUST DEFIED
AN JUSTIFIABLE MILITARY
OPERATION GOING ON IN GAZA BUT
IF YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT HIS
DEMEANOR, HIS CONDUCT IS
PROSECUTION IS MANAGEMENT OF
THE WORK GETS 100% POLITICAL.
WE MET AMBASSADOR PINCUS WITH
THAT AND HOW DAMAGED HIS
POLITICAL STANDING IS WITH HIS
OWN PEOPLE THERE IS STILL REALLY
A UNITED DETERMINATION ON THE
PART OF ISRAEL TO ELIMINATE
HAMAS SHIP.
WE'RE SEVENTH IS RAW AND THE
SAVAGERY OF THAT AND THEY SEE
YOU NEXT ESSENTIAL THREAT
UNDERSTANDABLY.
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT
THAT.
YOU ARE RIGHT.
THE DEVASTATION, THE ANGER, THE
HUMILIATION AND THE EXACT
NATURAL HUMAN DESIRE FOR REVENGE
IS THERE.
AND TOPPLING HAMAS OR
ERADICATING OR ELIMINATING IT
POLITICALLY TO THE POINT THAT
POLITICALLY TO THE POINT THAT
IT HAS NO -- IT POLITICALLY
INCAPACITATED HAS NO RESIDUAL
POWER NEITHER POLITICAL NOR
MILITARY IS ABSOLUTELY
PREVALENT IN ISRAELI SOCIETY.
THAT DOES NOT ABSOLVE MR.
NETANYAHU OF HIS RESPONSIBILITY
AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO IN RECENT
POSTS AS RECENT AS THREE DAYS
AGO 72% OF ISRAELIS WANT HIM TO
RESIGN.
31% NOW AND 41% IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE WAR WHICH MAKES IT
72%.
DEFEATING HAMAS IS A CONSENSUS
IN ISRAEL.
