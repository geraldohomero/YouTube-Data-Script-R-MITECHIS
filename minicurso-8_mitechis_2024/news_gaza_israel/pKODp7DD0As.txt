that is going on these days and since
October in Palestine especially in the
Gaza Strip is already inhuman is by
Out of all the parameters of what
It has been seen in recent times in the
History of humanity is very serious
Really and now there is a kind of
tension in relation to what could be
Another attack but in the passage of Rafá is
The border with Egypt a very
important because through this
Corridor enters humanitarian aid is
Say Combustible Food Medicines
Well everything that is necessary
for survival and that could be
attacked by Israeli troops
narrow streets of the city of Rafá in
The southern end of Gaza were full
of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians because
Of course they have to leave what their
Life place basically not your
homeland if you want and pass this
Lugor to be more protected before
eh intense bombings Rafael mimics with
Egypt and it is the last place
relatively safe in Gaza Hogar
also of Palestinians expelled from
north and center of the strip from the
October 7 by the way the figure of
dead is approaching 30,000
There is approximately 29,000
figure that as we have seen from the
October 7 grows very quickly not the
monitoring of the death toll is going to
a really very high rhythm
residents say that food is scarce
that sanitary conditions are
deficient and that there are many
diseases too and it is not another way
to carry out a siege not to allow
The entry of medicines destroy the
hospitals is simply to let
germinates this chaos and that people follow
Dying Israel on the other hand waiting
continue with military operations
large -scale for another eight weeks
More so intense days come
especially for the gaza strip
Military bosses believe they can damage
significantly the capacities
RESTENT NEVER TAKING THE ROAD
also for a change of a minor phase
intensity will have to be seen when
It comes at the moment everything is chaos in that
place and so it seems that it will continue to
less for the next two
months
