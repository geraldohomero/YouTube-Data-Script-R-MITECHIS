May God bless you on Shabbat Shalom
Our forces are deployed throughout the country
Saturday in a far off area
From home today all of us Understand we're fighting for
Home's home
We're all fighting like
The soldiers and the soldiers of the police are bills
Civilians
And civilian security forces Medicine and Rescue
And you are citizens of Israel with the great spirit of volunteering
Yours that excites the world
All of us
We're all recruited
United many more It will be told of the heroic act of
We are in the dark days of pain and sorrow for her
Saturday
Damn stories that intertwined in history
Israel We will never forget the comparison they made
To us
I also spoke to some of the families today
They lost their loved ones or their fate - Unknown
Their world is a sword
About them I am
You will never forget the comparison
Our enemy and never
Forgiven and not given Never or anyone
To forget those armies that were not made for the people
Jews for decades
The last of us are eternally at an enemy with a powerless force
A precedent - I am
It underlines this just the beginning. Our enemies have just begun
Pay up
The price and I will not detail what will come next but
I say It's just you guys
The beginning of talks with President Biden and with leaders
We are others in the world and in many other efforts we are
Israel has international support
I met with the Secretary of State today
The United States is promising the continuation of the war
With more ammunition coming into the country Middle
Fighting we will eliminate the violence we will bring
Victory will take time, but we will end the war
This one's stronger than May God will give you
Our enemies rise up against us
We have Saturday before us
