>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL
REPORT.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M JUJU CHANG
AT ABC NEWS HEADQUARTERS HERE IN
NEW YORK. WE'RE INTERRUPTING
YOUR REGULAR PROGRAMING WITH
SOME BREAKING NEWS. ISRAEL HAS
INITIATED A RETALIATORY STRIKE
AGAINST IRAN. ACCORDING TO A
SENIOR US OFFICIAL. THIS COMES
JUST FIVE DAYS AFTER TEHRAN
LAUNCHED A DIRECT MILITARY
ASSAULT ON ISRAEL, FIRING MORE
THAN 300 DRONES AND MISSILES.
MOST WERE INTERCEPTED BY ISRAEL
WITH THE HELP OF ALLIES,
INCLUDING THE US. SINCE THAT
UNPRECEDENTED WEEKEND ATTACK,
ISRAEL HAS VOWED TO RETALIATE.
WE TURN NOW TO ABC'S MATT
GUTMAN, WHO IS IN ISRAEL WITH
THE LATEST REPORTING. MATT, WHAT
ARE YOU HEARING?
>> JUJU A SENIOR US OFFICIAL
TELLING US THAT ISRAELI MISSILES
HAVE HIT AT LEAST ONE SITE
INSIDE IRAN. NO REPORTS YET ON
CASUALTIES OR WHAT SPECIFICALLY?
THIS SITE WAS. AS YOU MENTIONED,
ISRAEL HAS BEEN TELEGRAPHING
THAT IT WILL RESPOND. OFFICIALS
TELLING ME AT THE TIME AND PLACE
OF THEIR CHOOSING, THEY DID NOT
SPECIFY WHAT THAT RESPONSE WOULD
BE LIKE, WE DIDN'T KNOW WHEN IT
WOULD COME. AND OF COURSE, THIS
IS IN RESPONSE TO THAT MASSIVE
MISSILE SALVO FROM LAST
SATURDAY, THE LARGEST BALLISTIC
MISSILE SALVO IN HISTORY. AND,
OF COURSE, IRAN HAS SAID THAT IF
ISRAEL CHOOSES TO RESPOND, THE
IRANIAN RESPONSE WOULD BE
SEVERE. AND IMMEDIATE.
>> JUJU, MATT, THANK YOU. FROM
THE LATEST IN ISRAEL. LET'S TURN
NOW TO CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS
ANCHOR MARTHA RADDATZ IN DC WITH
THE LATEST. MARTHA, WHAT ARE YOU
HEARING?
>> IT IS A SINGLE SENIOR US
OFFICIAL WHO SAID THAT IT HAD
STARTED THAT ISRAEL HAD
RETALIATED AND HIT ONE SITE IN
IRAN. THERE ARE REPORTS THIS
EVENING THAT OTHER PLACES, IRAQ
AND SYRIA HAVE BEEN HIT. THIS US
SENIOR OFFICIAL SAID THEY SIMPLY
CANNOT CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE
REPORTS YESTERDAY THAT ISRAEL
WOULD WOULD HOLD OFF ON THESE
STRIKES UNTIL AFTER THE
PASSOVER, AFTER PASSOVER. BUT
TODAY WE STARTED GETTING
INDICATIONS THAT IT COULD COME
MUCH QUICKER THAN THAT. THE
SENIOR OFFICIAL ALSO SAID THE
ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN QUITE
SECRETIVE ABOUT THIS, SO THERE'S
VERY LITTLE INFORMATION WE HAVE
AT THIS POINT ABOUT THE STRIKE
THAT THE US SENIOR OFFICIAL SAID
THAT ISRAEL HAD MADE INSIDE IRAN
.
>> WELL, MARTHA RADDATZ, THANK
YOU FOR THAT UPDATE. OF COURSE,
WE WILL RETURN TO OUR REGULAR
PROGRAMING REPORTING. THIS HAS
BEEN A
