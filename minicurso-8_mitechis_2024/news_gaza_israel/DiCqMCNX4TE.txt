I'm right for my ex -boyfriend
19 -year -old Lee Hyo -jeong's story yesterday
In the newsroom
I told you that the issue to be arrested for emergency
The perpetrator released because it is not
Since high school students, he has been chasing Hyojeong
It was confirmed by the girl.
I reported an assault on the police, but
I couldn't stop Bae Seung -ju
I'm a reporter, I was in the same high school
Since I started Mr. Lee
I was able to get out of graduation
I thought it would be
No, you can go to a better university
I was there, but I want to be with my sister
I followed it. As I became an adult, more often
I hit hard and bruised on my face
Sounds like eyes and completely unpleasant bottles
Listen to it
Get right
Most of them are obsessed with Mr. Lee
It gets worse.
I can't even go to that convenience store
Monitoring and leaving your hometown
Hyojung, who was there, was increasingly isolated
Because I hit my friends in front of my friends
My sister can't go a lot of people anymore
From December 2022 to 1 year
Only the number of times reported to the police
It's a case, but Kim hits it, but Jung is
If you defend or block it, it's a bilateral assault
Eventually, it was over.
If you just get angry, hit the bread
I did it, but she just cheated
Although the resentment was great and the resentment was great
Every time I ask you to break up, hit more and what
Hyojeong may have to throw away work again
I couldn't do anything
In fact, it is difficult.
Almost all the perpetrators have it
Not only I do it, but I will do my family
It may be, and in the end, my ex -boyfriend's hand
Hyojeong's survivor who died
In addition, I sued additional accusations for stalking
