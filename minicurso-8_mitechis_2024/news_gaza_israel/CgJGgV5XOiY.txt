FOR MORE THAN 6 MONTHS. NO
PROTESTERS HAVE SHUT DOWN A
FENCE AND INTERRUPTED SPEECHES
BY PRESIDENT BIDEN AND JUST
YESTERDAY THEY BLOCKED
CRITICAL ROADWAYS AND BRIDGES
IN CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO,
NEW YORK CITY. AND HERE IN
CHICAGO, MANY OF THESE
PROTESTERS ARE DEMANDING AN
IMMEDIATE ISRAELI CEASE FIRE
IN GAZA. BUT OTHERS ARE
CALLING FOR MUCH MORE AND SAY
THESE DISRUPTIONS WILL NOT
STOP INTEL IN THEIR WORDS,
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ARE FREE.
THE STATION'S BROOKE. SHAFER
IS LIVE IN. BROOKE, THESE
DISRUPTIONS ARE REALLY
BECOMING MUCH MORE ORGANIZED.
YEAH. AND NICOLE, THE GROUP
BEHIND YESTERDAY'S COAST TO
COAST PROTESTS DEMONSTRATIONS
THAT WE SAW FROM HERE IN MIAMI
ALL THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA SAID
THAT THEY WANTED A DID STRIKE
AGAINST THE U.S. ECONOMY. THE
GROUP BEHIND THOSE PROTESTS
THAT WE SAW YESTERDAY SAID
THAT THEY WERE PART OF A
MOVEMENT CALLED A 15 CALLING
FOR A CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA.
THEIR WEBSITE CALLING APRIL
15TH A COORDINATED ECONOMIC
BLOCKADE TO FREE PALESTINE.
THE GROUP ONLINE, WRITING
QUOTE, THERE IS A NEED TO
SHIFT FROM SYMBOLIC ACTIONS TO
THOSE THAT CAUSE PAIN TO THE
ECONOMY AND THAT IS WHAT WE
SAW YESTERDAY. MAJOR CITIES
NATIONWIDE FACING PROTESTS IN
NEW YORK. PROTESTERS MARCHED
ONTO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE
BLOCKING TRAFFIC THE SAME IN
SAN FRANCISCO. THE GOLDEN GATE
BRIDGE SHUT DOWN IN OAKLAND,
CALIFORNIA. PEOPLE CHANGE
RAHM'S BLOCKING AN INTERSTATE
AND THEN MANY TRAVELERS WERE
FORCED TO WALK WITH THEIR BAGS
TO THE AIRPORT IN CHICAGO AS
DEMONSTRATORS BLOCKED THE
ENTRANCE TO ONE OF THE
NATION'S BUSIEST AIRPORTS
TODAY. SOME ARE CALLING ON THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GIVE
ATTENTION TO THESE KINDS OF
DEMONSTRATIONS, INCLUDING SOME
IN THE PAST HAVE INCLUDED
AMERICA.
AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY FEEL
AND THEY ARE BEING ALLOWED
ACCESS TO CREATING THESE TYPES
DISTURBANCES AND THERE IS
AGAIN ABSENCE OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT. IT'S IT'S MIND
BOGGLING TO ME THAT THIS
DOESN'T DETRACT THE SORT OF
FEDERAL ATTENTION THAT SHOULD
PERHAPS ATTENTION IS DIVERTED
ELSEWHERE. BUT THIS IS EXACTLY
THE TYPE OF THREAT THAT NEEDS
TO BE A FORCE.
AND THE GROUP BEHIND THOSE
PROTESTS YESTERDAY NOT MEANT
TO JUST BLOCK THE ECONOMY HERE
IN THE U.S. THAT A 15 MOVEMENT
ANNOUNCING DEMONSTRATIONS
YESTERDAY FROM MEXICO CITY TO
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA. WE'VE
REACHED OUT TO THEM FOR
COMMENT. NICOLE. ALL RIGHT,
