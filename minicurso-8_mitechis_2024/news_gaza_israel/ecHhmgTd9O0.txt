After the rocket attacks of Iran
Israel has on the weekend
Defense Minister Claudia Tanner
On Monday again on one
Participation in Austria in the European
Air defense system Skyshield
Pounded it is out of the question that we
our
Strengthen air defense ability
So it is necessary to
European Skyschield to participate
Together with Switzerland and with 17
other countries a total of 19 one
Initiative that of Germany
went out and that in the
Possibility will put us against
All threats from the air too
Correspondingly equipped are no matter of
what range it is about one
Protection screen we over Austria
we will tension no tension
have skills without a doubt in
Area of air defense not
so that we are at the time
It would be possible to ward off 99% but it
Wä only one BR
Tanner expressed incomprehension about the
FPÖ criticism of Austria's participation
What European Skysild is one
Milbr. The states just
Your procurement cooperation we do it
In many areas they also have
Your skills have to retrofit in
the different ranges that means
A shell in three protective layers
Build that in cities
lives as well as that as that
in in Zurich and what brings the advantage
also from this procurement cooperation
It's faster it is without a doubt
Then also more efficiently cheaper
And that also interoperable and
We see that again and again
We can have last week
had an incident than a Turkish
Passenger machine no radio contact
no radio contact can be established
could it be over 12 minutes in
Austrian territory
On the way ours are on fiter
Fortunately, it was upset
also the radio contact also produced
But alone these examples will be the
pass in about 50 to 60 times a year
show that we are preparing
need to go to all sorts
Threats and and scenarios and me
think that is a very important one
Step and very openly I understand
not why it
meanwhile known that I
Name do not give why a uh one is one
something against the right side
can have that you
Austrians before
This protects the threats from the air
I am after this weekend and after
the pictures we also from the
Ukraine unfortunately God has been for so long
Long time see that is just not
understandable and
As I said, that's that
The task that we also in the area
become noble for defensive
It is different
