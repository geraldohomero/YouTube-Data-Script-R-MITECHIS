Un city because Northern Gaz you like I
I am telling Israel in most places now
The army flag is waving but right now
South Gaz is a challenge Khan Yani city air
A woman and child are shocking with strike
Claim of death claimed people buried in debris
Going data on behalf of Hamas
It has been claimed that till now in war
More than 11000 Palestinians have been killed
There are big of women and children in this
While 2700 Palestinians are missing
At the same time, the data released from Israel said
Is that Hamas's terrorist attacks from 1200
More Israeli has been killed while 239
If people have kept hostage, then Israel
Casuality of 1200 people is reported from side to side
And 239 people are reported hostage
While really from Palestine
Palestine is wrong to name it
Fighters to fight for fighters
Call damage because of and due to humas
If you get it, then from there
12000 is being told
Why and why should it be said
It has been that Khan's number has come to Khan
In Yunus you are watching strike
And it is part of southern gaz
That the number of Southern Gaz arrived
It is being said because Israel claims
Has done that now on the terrorist South Gaz
Are engaged in escaping and here I
Showing you the gaz strip that now
A map in your mind too
It must have become the bottom part of it
How much wide part you are looking here
This is the part that is the house and actually
Northern Gaz North Gaz This Wala here
Part which is in most places
Israel now proves its super messy
Diya is waving Israel's flags here
But this place on this place and especially Khan
The area of Yunus is on this side
Terrorists have run away, now that place
Consolidated is not identified these places
It is as I am telling you to Hamas
Terrorists have embedded themselves
Embraced with civilians
In such a situation with civilian bases
Identify and by pin pointing those places
Blowing where Hamas terrorists are hidden
Are it not easy task
