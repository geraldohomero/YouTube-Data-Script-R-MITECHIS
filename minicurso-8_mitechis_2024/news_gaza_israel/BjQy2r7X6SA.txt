Give karam first show fencing
Hundreds of fencing by breaking away from some of the fencing
Number of terrorists entered the village
And it must be seen in the front you
This fencing if you cross a little distance
If you go, you will see Gaza, we will come back
And here you break this fencing before
So the entire outer area was destroyed
Waste this, see which fencing broken
Has been entered from there and karma now
