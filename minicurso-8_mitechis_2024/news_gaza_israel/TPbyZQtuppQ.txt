it's not officially
a war but the images and the impacts
are the same ten members of a
palestinian family who had gathered for
eid were killed following an israeli
airstrike
a baby the lone survivor found clutching
his dead mother palestinians say at
least
140 people including 39 children have
been killed in gaza
since air strikes began on monday tammy
jacoby is a professor with expertise in
arab-israeli conflict
there's no middle ground and so people
are being radicalized
either anti-israeli pro-palestinian or
pro-israeli anti-palestinian that
doesn't really help
to de-escalate the situation there is
no active
mobilization for dialogue peace
moderation compromise u.s president joe
biden has spoken to israeli prime
minister benjamin netanyahu
and the president of the palestinian
authority mahmoud abbas
he's expressed his support for both
sides and for finding a peaceful
resolution to the conflict
but the militant group hamas controls
gaza
and it has fired roughly two thousand
rockets into israel
killing residents michael hemi is a
canadian living
in tel aviv a rocket just hit my uncle's
city today
um so i called him up immediately and
asked to check to see if he was okay
and i think about it i think about the
palestinians that are going through the
same thing and
you know the mothers and and fathers and
families are
calling up their their relatives to make
sure that they're okay
there are and will be no winner says
canada's
former ambassador to israel unless old
land claims are set aside
and new leaders chosen hamas is not
interested in a two-state solution so
they're happy to have a bibi netanyahu
and a very right-wing government
in power in israel because then they can
point to the occupier
and say that there's no partner for
peace
one high-rise building hit house
residents and
international media including the
associated press
that building provided the best vantage
point for the world
to see the events in gaza and now that
building
is destroyed and we will work
hard to continue to tell the world the
important
events of gaza israeli military
officials gave the building's owner an
hour's notice so it could be evacuated
saying it had information that hamas had
been using the site
