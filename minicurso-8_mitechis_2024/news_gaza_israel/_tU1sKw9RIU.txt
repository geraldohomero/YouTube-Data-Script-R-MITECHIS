8:30 in the morning
here noon in
gaza there we are seeing how I know
some centers of
assistance for all those
people who are homeless many of
They many of them hundreds of thousands and
We also see that in one of these
tents there is an ambulance and there
They perform the first assists and in
case they are necessary
to the hospitals that are also
overflowed and that they also have the
Infrastructure necessary for
attend them to imagine the amount of
injured people arrive every day
whom
Gaza saw several missiles falling
On different points of Gaza the
Israeli army then came out to clarify
that the attacks had been
targeted to other locations but without
However, the objectives have been very
very damaged between them as usually
Objectives occur
civilians the city of Gaza today is the
main bastion of ever of this group
terrorist is surrounded and Israel for its
Good part ensures that your troops
They advanced to the heart of the city
what they say is densely
Populated 1:30 in the afternoon now in the
Gaza Strip We are seeing images
in
I live this is happening now there we are
Seeing a kind of improvised center
of assistance to people
injured many people who are going to ask
For your relatives, remember that Israel
through Net Yahu for a request for
Jo Biden promised that it would be some
Non -hour attack intervals
logically considered
insufficient because attacks too
They arrive in many cases like
We mentioned
Before the attacks fall on rockets
drone bombs fall while
performing rescue tasks
Imagine that in this place now
A bomb falls a drone
They permanently produce these disasters
Because it is not a safe place power
Hey transfer them to hospitals because
As we were
Seeing and informing is precisely the
hospitals are not a place
Sure unfortunately
In fact to make a comparison the
first days after 7 of
October that was the date on which the
Group never attacked Israel two bombings
In 24 hours it was considered as a
intense attack now that period went from
24 hours at an hour nothing else that gives us
a guideline of how the ferocity of
Israel attacks
has increased significantly
