this edition in jerusalem where broof
clashes were reported between israeli
police
and palestinians at the al-aqsa mosque
on sunday
more serious injuries were reported and
israeli prime minister naftali bennett
ordered the police to continue allowing
jews to ascend temple mount
on the first day of tisha buharf no
further incidents were reported during
the jewish visits which lasted until
sunday afternoon
the prime minister also assured the full
freedom of worship
on the temple mount will be maintained
for muslims
who want to mark the day of arafah and
ill eid al-azha this week temple mount
is the third holiest site in islam
and the holiest for jews because it is
the location of biblical temples
it also has a history of being the site
of israeli-palestine
violence the most recent being an 11-day
war between israel and hamas militants
in the gaza strip tisha buhav is a day
of mourning
and repentance when jewish people
reflect on the destruction
of the first and second temples in
jerusalem both key events
in jewish history
yes
leon's correspondent geordie cohen has
this report from jerusalem
tishov ervil the ninth of the hebrew
month of of is the time when jews across
the world
mark the destruction of the first and
second temples in jerusalem
with fasting and prayer today al-aqsa
mosque stands where the jewish temples
once stood
but it remains the holiest place in
judaism
now in the six day war in 1967 jews took
back control of the holy site
that gave authority to the muslim work
to administer it for muslims to continue
to be able to pray there
over the years jews have been able to
visit the site but have not been
permitted to pray there for fear of
upsetting the status quo
now it seems that the police have been
turning a blind eye to silent
jewish prayer on the site as long as
nothing visibly jewish is on display
with prime minister naftali bennett
saying that both jews
and muslims will continue to have
freedom of worship
on the temple mount however public
security minister omar valev
subsequently suggested that the pm meant
to save freedom of worship for muslims
and freedom of movements for jews this
is jody cohen from jerusalem
for we on world is one
