BETTER NO ONE FEELS THAT MORE
THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
MR. PRESIDENT.
>> FOLKS, THERE'S AN IRISH POET
NAMED [ INAUDIBLE ], AND HE
WROTE A LINE AND SAID TOO LONG
SUFFERING MAKES THE STONE OF THE
HEART.
TOO LONG OF SUFFERING MAKES THE
STONE.
THE THING THAT I FOUND WITH ALL
OF YOU IS NONE OF YOUR HEARTS
HAVE TURNED TO STONE YET.
EVERY ONE HAS TALKED ABOUT WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO.
EVERY ONE HAS TALKED ABOUT
HAVING TO REACH OUT.
TALKED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
THEY'RE A JEW OR A MUSLIM, REACH
OUT.
YOU KNOW, I'VE OFTEN SAID HOW I
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT I
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT I
WAS IN ISRAEL JUST BEFORE THE
SIX-DAY WAR AND SHE WAS TELLING
ME HOW TERRIBLE EVERYTHING WAS
AND SHE WAS -- HE SHE KEPT
FLIPPING THE MAPS UP AND DOWN
BEHIND HER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS, WOULD YOU
LIKE A PHOTOGRAPH?
AND I THOUGHT, THAT'S UNUSUAL.
SHE JUST GOT UP AND WALKED OUT.
WE WERE OUTSIDE HER OFFICE.
STANDING THERE HAVING A
PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN LIKE YOU AND I.
SHE, WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME, SHE
TURNED, SHE LOOKED AND SAID, YOU
LOOK WORRIED, SENATOR.
I SAID I AM.
SHE SAID, DON'T WORRY.
WE JEWS HAVE A SECRET WEAPON IN
OUR FIGHT.
WE HAVE NO PLACE ELSE TO GO.
WELL, TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, IF
THERE WEREN'T AN ISRAEL, WE
WOULD HAVE TO INVENT ONE.
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, I
BELIEVE THAT -- WENT HOME AND
GOT IN TROUBLE AT THE TIME, BUT
IT'S TRUE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A JEW TO BE A ZIONIST.
AND I THINK THE SECURITY AND
SAFETY OF JEWS WILL WORLD IS
ANCHORED IN THE CONTINUED
VIBRANCE OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK IT'S ABOUT.
AT ITS CORE.
SO I'VE ADMIRED YOU ALL IN THIS
COUNTRY FOR SO LONG, AND I'M
CONVINCED THAT MORE PEOPLE KNOW
YOUR RESPONSES TO WHAT'S
HAPPENING, AS OPPOSED TO JUST
WHAT WAR AND PEACE IS ABOUT.
