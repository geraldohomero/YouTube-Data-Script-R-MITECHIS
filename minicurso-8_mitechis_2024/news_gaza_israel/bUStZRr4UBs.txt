HERE'S MORE FROM NBC'S RICHARD
ENGEL.
>> Reporter: FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN MONTHS, RUSSIAN TROOPS
ARE MAKING ADVANCES AFTER
LAUNCHED THEIR SECOND MAJOR
OFFENSIVE OF THIS WAR AND
UKRAINIAN COMMANDERS SAY THEY
SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FIRE
POWER TO STOP IT, DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH WEAPONS.
MOST UKRAINIAN TANKS LIKE THIS
ONE ARE ABOUT 50 YEARS OLD.
THEY ARE STILL BEING PUT INTO
SERVICE, THEY ARE STILL BEING
REPAIRED, BUT, LIKE OLD CLASSIC
VEHICLES, AND THIS IS NOW
PRACTICALLY A MUSEUM PIECE,
SPARE PARTS ARE A PROBLEM.
THEY ARE NOT MAKING SPARE PARTS
ANYMORE.
THEY'RE NOT MAKING AMMUNITION
ANYMORE FOR TANKS LIKE THESE.
THESE ARE SOVIET-ERA TANKS AND
RUSSIA STILL PRODUCING IS
AMMUNITION FOR THEM, BUT CLEARLY
RUSSIA'S NOT SUPPLYING THAT
AMMUNITION TO ITS ENEMY HERE IN
UKRAINE SO THEY ARE USING THE
STOCKPILES THAT THEY HAVE BUT
THOSE STOCKPILES ARE RUNNING
OUT.
IT'S GOTTEN TO A POINT THAT
COMMANDERS SAY THEY CAN ONLY
FIRE THESE TANKS WHEN THEY SEE A
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE.
IN THE SUMMER, THEY WERE FIRING
TANKS ALL DAY LONG, DAY AND
NIGHT AT RUSSIAN TROOPS.
NOW THE SUPPLIES ARE SO LIMITED,
THEY HAVE TO PICK THEIR SHOTS
AND USE THEM VERY CAUTIOUSLY.
THAT IS WHY UKRAINIANS ARE
URGENTLY ASKING FOR MORE
WEAPONS.
EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES
HAVE BOTH SAID THEY WILL SUPPLY
MORE MODERN TANKS BUT IT'S
UNCLEAR WHEN THOSE WILL GET
HERE.
SOME TRAINING HAS BEGUN.
AND UKRAINIANS SAY WHEN THEY DO
FINALLY ARRIVE, THEY COULD BE A
GAME CHANGER BECAUSE THE WESTERN
TANKS SHOOT FARTHER, THEY HAVE
THERMAL VISION AND OTHER MORE
ADVANCED TARGETING SYSTEMS, AND
CRITICALLY, THERE IS STILL A
SUPPLY CHAIN PRODUCING THE
AMMUNITION TO ALLOW THEM TO KEEP
THIS WAR GOING, AND UKRAINIANS
SAY RIGHT NOW, WITH WHAT THEY
HAVE, THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP
THEIR DEFENCES, BUT IF THEY GET
THE NEW EQUIPMENT, THEY WIL
