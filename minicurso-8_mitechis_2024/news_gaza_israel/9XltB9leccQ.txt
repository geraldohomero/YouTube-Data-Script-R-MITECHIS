the life of mustafa safadi has turned
upside down after his brother nidal was
killed in may
his death broke me he says
now mustafa's responsible for his
brother's three children and a
there were calls from locals to put out
a fire that settlers started in the
fields settlers were there shooting at
us protected by the army before my
brother was shot two others were wounded
by rocks and bullets
this is the moment before safadi was
shot
he was one of 11 palestinians killed
that day during confrontations across
the occupied west bank
human rights organizations say four of
them were killed during settler attacks
you can see the settlement of its how up
on the hill over there and what happened
is that settlers invaded the village of
reef israel has long allowed many of its
settlers to carry guns but the criteria
to get weapons was expanded in 2018
making it even easier for settlers to
obtain arm this violence is state-backed
this is not the work of lone wolves that
are acting as if by their own whim
but it's actually state policy it is
part of life in the west bank under
israel's apartheid regime palestinians
say settler attacks have become
organized
so far this year the un has documented
more than three hundred nearly a third
have led to injuries more than previous
years
suhera saida has experienced settler
attacks several times
none has been as devastating as losing
her son in may
we don't know who killed him we saw the
videos showing israeli soldiers and
settlers next to each other how would we
know
her son hossam was shot by the israeli
military in confrontations that began
after settlers attacked the village
palestinians accused the israeli army
often of backing settler attacks
the israeli army told al jazeera these
allegations are not true and it
regularly investigates operational
activities
one incident the israeli army says it's
investigating is of a settler taking a
soldier's weapon
many palestinians like safadi say these
investigations are a way to save face
because often no one
is held to account nida ibrahim
