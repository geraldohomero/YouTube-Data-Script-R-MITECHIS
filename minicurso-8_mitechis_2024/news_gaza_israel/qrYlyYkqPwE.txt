I one of five sons of J my mother she's
kidnapped byas and we expecting to get
back get her back home
now
a week and a
half
after October
7th
and IDF represent
presentative came to my sister's house
and told her told told us that she
is assumingly
kidnapped and they asked about my
brother-in-law and we didn't get any
answer on that
night his kids got the message that
their
father was murdered by
Hamas my
sister ER was uh hospitalized due to uh
breast
cancer personally I don't like to talk
about her uh her medical issues but in
this case because she was uh she was
after this uh
medical
surgery and that she needs her pills or
treatment it's very very important to me
to say that uh we need we need someone
to check to check up to see if she's
okay if she needs anything
because her condition her medical
condition might might get worse and we
are extremely
worried the least that I expect is that
my country my country will
do the best to release my my sister and
all the others that are kidnapped and
held by
Kamas this is my
expectation I want my prime minister I
want somebody to do his
best his best to bring them back

I'm
we're going to walk barefooted like hen
had to run from the terrorists that took
her we're going to walk from here from
Aima Square down
to the new square that symbolizes all
the
hostages
and it's something that just came from
Yan's
friends
we had team's Specialties to find the
footprints to track her they didn't find
any sign of battle or blood so we have
full faith that she's
fine
um the professional team gathered all
the information and after about 10 days
we got the official notification that
she's hostage in Gaza we don't have an a
lot of information but we have a lot of
Hope
in the first few days we were very
hopeful that it's going to end soon and
we'll see her very
quickly and we're hoping that no one
loses hope and continues to talk about
it to think about it and to push it
Forward I mean the government can't give
up on all of these
people they have families that are
waiting for them and we are
too
