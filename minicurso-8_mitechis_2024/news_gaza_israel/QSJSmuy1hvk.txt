THE IDF OFFERED PEOPLE IN THE
NORTH OF THE GAZA STRIP SAFE
PASSAGE INTO THE SOUTH OF GAZA
UNTIL FOUR PM LOCAL TIME.
THAT IS LESS THAN TWO HOURS
AWAY.
JOINING US NOW, NBC NEWS CHIEF
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT RICHARD
ENGEL'S REPORTING NEAR THE GAZA
BORDER IN ISRAEL.
RICHARD, WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THESE SAFE PASSAGE ROUTES?
ABOUT THESE SAFE PASSAGE ROUTES?
>> SO ISRAEL SAYS THAT THERE
ARE TWO SAFE PASSAGE ROUTES
THAT IT HAS CLEARED TO ALLOW
PEOPLE FROM THE NORTHERN GAZA
STRIP TO GO TO THE SOUTH OF
GAZA.
NOT TO LEAVE THE GAZA STRIP
ENTIRELY, JUST A MOVE FROM ONE
PART TO THE OTHER.
THIS, IN THE DISTANCE THERE,
WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE
RISING, THAT IS GAZA CITY.
THAT IS THE BIGGEST CITY IN
NORTHERN GAZA STRIP.
THAT IS HOME TO ROUGHLY THE
SURROUNDING AREA AROUND IT AND
HOME TO ROUGHLY 1 MILLION
PALESTINIANS.
ISRAEL EFFECTIVELY WANTS TO END
THE CITY SO THAT IT CAN MOVE IN
WITH ITS GROUND OFFENSIVE,
OFFENSIVE AGAINST HAMAS, AND
RESCUE OPERATION.
BUT MANY PALESTINIANS WERE
LIVING THERE I DON'T WANT TO
LEAVE BECAUSE THEY DON'T
BELIEVE THAT IT IS SOMETHING
THAT THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO
DO, THEY'VE BEEN REFUGEES
BEFORE, THEY DON'T TO BE
REFUGEES AGAIN.
THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY
SHOULD HAVE TO STAY IN THEIR
HOMES AND PAY THE PRICE THAT
HAMAS ATTACKS THAT THEY HAD NO
INVOLVEMENT IN.
OTHERS WHO DO WANT TO LEAVE SAY
THAT THEY ARE STRUGGLING
BECAUSE ISRAEL IS CUT OFF THE
ENTIRE GAZA STRIP, AND SO THEY
DON'T HAVE GAS FOR THEIR CARS.
ALSO, THE ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES
ARE STILL ONGOING.
THEIR ONGOING IN GAZA AND
THEY'VE BEEN CONCENTRATING ON
THE SOUTH OF THE GAZA STRIP.
THE SPECIFIC AREA WHERE PEOPLE
ARE BEING TOLD TO GO.
AND ONE REASON THAT MIGHT BE
THE CASE IS EARLIER TODAY HAMAS
ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THAT
ITS FIGHTERS HAD ONCE AGAIN,
LIKE THEY DID A WEEK AGO,
CROSSED INTO ISRAEL, BROKE
THROUGH THE FENCE IN SOUTHERN
GAZA AND ATTACKED ISRAELI
TROOPS.
AND SO THEY ARE DOING THIS
EVACUATION, SOME OF THEM,
THOUSANDS OF THEM ARE DOING
THIS EVACUATION, BUT THEY ARE
DOING IT UNDER FIRE WHILE HAMAS
