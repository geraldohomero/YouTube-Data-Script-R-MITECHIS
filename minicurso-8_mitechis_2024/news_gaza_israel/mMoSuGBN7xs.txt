No one will be quiet because Nilya has to ask
Own your heart and send it all
The candles
It's quiet you really, really want though In my heart not to tell
And when you say it with your heart, turn off the bitter with it
Po's ready. Ask her to
(Applause) (Applause)
I will
Yeah, when we were in Schneider's room, uh, we had to
Two days later we left
And we were told we could collect whatever they are
They made us in the room and Booth toys Daniel started
Pick things up and put in a bag and Amelia like that
I look at her and her mother says You're safe
Which we can allow the Hamsa to take all
The stuff
In the room now, I'm going to go for days
The first was They were really afraid of them
They can come here and do them harm
Here in Israel and took them to Daniel too And Sharon too
A few good days up
Get rid of that feeling
There if they say anything maybe to the media either
Let them say it will come Jesus killed them here, Daniel
When she spoke to us I almost wouldn't hear her as
Debra's like that so I tell her Talk more about it then
What it turns out
Which put some of the time to order them not to speak in a whisper
Now it was even more noticeable At Sharon's.
And the girls that it was we would talk about but took her
- Sort of
Two days he got used to talking in a normal way. They were most
The time
In the tunnels the food was very scarce
And Daniel says that sometimes she is
She wouldn't eat, say, to keep something
To Amelia In the evening, they would not have received it
There was food sometimes and there were always other people
There were eight people Ten people if
It was crowded so it was harder to breathe
And as far as Bauer and all that stuff and Lula is concerned, she said
That there's a mother Daniel was right in the moment
And she was kidnapped and taken from Daniel Daniel's hands
She screamed and said no, I don’t want that She did
They pointed a gun at me and said if you don't whistle
You're being shot. Sharon is very, very sensitive and in pain
Her husband I don’t know what’s going on with him and he’s alone
Here with
The bananas
