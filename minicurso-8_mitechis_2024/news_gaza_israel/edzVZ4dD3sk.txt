THE MILITARY WING OF HAMAS
YESTERDAY.
AND NOW IT INCLUDES ALL OF THE
ISRAELI CIVILIANS AS WELL.
>> ALL RIGHT, RICHARD ENGEL
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
KEEP US UPDATED AS YOU LEARN
MORE.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
>>> WE HAVE OTHER BREAKING NEWS,
NBC NEWS LEARNING BETWEEN 200
AND 300 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN A
BOMBING TARGETING A HOSPITAL.
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A
SPOKESPERSON FOR THE PALESTINIAN
HEALTH MINISTRY.
I WANT TO BRING IN CORRESPONDENT
RAF SANCHEZ, WHO'S IN ISRAEL,
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT
DOP
DEVELOPMENT?
>> Reporter: THIS IS DEVELOPING
AS WE SPEAK, BUT THE PALESTINIAN
HEALTH MINISTRY IS SAYING A
HOSPITAL IN THE NORTHERN END OF
GAZA HAS TAKEN A DIRECT HIT FROM
AN ISRAELI AIR STRIKE THEY'RE
SAYING HUNDREDS, AT MINIMUM, 300
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE
STRIKE.
WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD ANY
COMMENTS ABOUT THIS ALLEGATION
FROM THE ISRAELI MILITARY.
BUT THESE IMAGES THAT ARE COMING
OUT OF GAZA CITY ARE ABSOLUTELY
HARROWING.
IT APPEARS TO SHOW VERY, VERY
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN THE
COURTYARD AREA OF THIS HOSPITAL,
CALLED BAPTIST HOSPITAL, IN THE
CENTER OF GAZA CITY.
THE PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT, THE
HEAD OF THE PALESTINIAN
AUTHORITY IN THE WEST BANK HAS
DECLARED THREE DAYS OF MOURNING.
HE SAID ALL FLAGS WILL BE
LOWERED TO HALF STAFF BECAUSE OF
THE SCALE OF THE LOSS OF LIFE.
THE PALESTINIANS ARE CALLING
THIS A MASSACRE.
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONFIRMATION
YET FROM THE ISRAELIS.
THEY HAVE REPEATEDLY AT POINTS
DURING THIS BOMBING CAMPAIGN
DISPUTED THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE
FOR VARIOUS STRIKES.
THIS HAPPENED IN THE NORTHERN
HALF OF GAZA.
THIS IS THE AREA WHERE ISRAEL IS
TELLING PEOPLE TO GET OUT, TO
FLEE TO THE SOUTH AHEAD OF WHAT
WE EXPECT WILL BE THIS
LONG-AWAITED GROUND OFFENSIVE.
BUT CHRIS, WE ARE HEARING OVER
AND OVER AGAIN FROM PALESTINIAN
DOCTORS YOU CANNOT MOVE CHILDREN
WHO ARE ON VENTILATORS.
YOU CANNOT MOVE CHILDREN WHO ARE
IN INCUBATORS.
YOU CANNOT MOVE PEOPLE WHO ARE
ON DIALYSIS MACHINES OUT OF
THESE HOSPITALS.
THEY SAY THE PATIENTS CANNOT BE
MOVED AND THE DOCTORS WILL NOT
MOVE AND LEAVE THEIR PATIENTS TO
DIE.
SO THIS IS JUST ONE ILLUSTRATION
OF THE HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNFOLDING
INSIDE OF GAZA RIGHT NOW.
THE UNITED NATIONS IS SAYING
THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY FOR
PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS TO COMPLY
