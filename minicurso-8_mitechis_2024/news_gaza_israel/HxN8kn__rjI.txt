Muttalaba does the way in 1987
When it on Telius in Jaffna in Sri Lanka
If this kind of spice was taken, India's
The government through the plane
They were in Jaffna and made them eat more
Was reminiscent of America in this way
Batania is to France when another
Jungle Azim from 1948 to 1949 when Berlin
America was being captured by Soviet
Saying the union, a corridor was created so that
The people of Berlin can get food there
If all these things are in front, I appeal to you
I am sitting here sitting here

If you do not get Palestinians, you are standing
I was feeling troublesome for a while
For that your sister is near
I am pregnant, I am not a hospital
I salute those innocent children of Palestine
Whoever gives the dead bodies of his parents
Rising slogan Takbir Allah Akbar by raising the slogan
I salute Palestine
Mother who gave their children's corpses
Seeing it, we are saying that we are Betul Mukadas
I do not leave, I salute them
To the elderly who gave their children in their sham
Seeing the martyrdom, he also says that Salahuddin
Ayybi is not yet dead, we are alive
Ajj friends and elders for us
Have to pray and one more time with me
