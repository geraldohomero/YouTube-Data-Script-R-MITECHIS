 
SOLUTION," AND YOU KNOW WHAT 
THAT IS, DEATH FOR JEWS AND 
ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS THEM.
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY 
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE ASKED ABOUT 
RISE IN ANTISEMITISM YESTERDAY.
JUST WATCH.
>> WHAT IS THIS LEVEL OF CONCERN
RIGHT NOW ABOUT POTENTIAL RISE 
OF ANTISEMITISM IN LIGHT OF 
EVERYTHING GOING ON IN ISRAEL?
>> SO COUPLE OF THINGS.
LOOK, WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY 
CREDIBLE THREATS, I KNOW THERE 
IS ALWAYS QUESTIONS ABOUT 
CREDIBLE THREATS.
SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
IS OUT THERE.
MUSLIM AND THOSE PERCEIVED TO BE
MUSLIM HAVE ENDURED 
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF 
HATE-FILLED ATTACK AND PRESIDENT

ARE WAITING FOR A LEVER IN

VIOLENCE IN OUR STREETS.
>> Harris: WHAT ON THE BATTLE
