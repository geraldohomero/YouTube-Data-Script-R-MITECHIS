ismail abushada is a 95 year old
palestinian
he was born and raised in jaffa
he has witnessed the deaths of his
siblings and also his wife who died five
years ago
his memories of being young come
floating back when he visits a coffee
shop in a jaffa that dates back to the
ottoman empire
he also remembers the great catastrophe
nakba
the residents of jaffa did not leave it
voluntarily but rather fled because of
the bombings the houses and buildings
were subjected to more than four
thousand rockets immigration from zafar
i don't want to talk about this anymore
because i saw it with my own eyes this
is heartbreaking for me
and his relatives were forced to migrate
some of them to the gaza strip
nakba separated abushada and his family
his cousin super flattered the gaza
strip because of heavy israeli bombing
in jaffa supie died there 24 years ago
and his son rushti has never seen his
relatives who still live in jaffa here
at abushada's house we are bringing them
together at least digitally
welcome
fishy
separated these families but the ongoing
israeli siege on gaza meant they
couldn't be reunited
russia lives less than 150 kilometers
away from his cousin ismail
but can only dream of jaffa
now despite all the bad circumstances it
remains in our hearts we teach our
children not to forget jaffa nor do they
forget palestine we have a property in
jaffa in yavin and robin
all of palestine is our country and i'm
not limited to jaffa alone jaffa is the
most beautiful city in the mediterranean

this was the first time both cousins had
seen each other and rushdie says what he
hopes for is to travel to jaffa to meet
ismail in person and to see where his
family were forced to flee mustafa
hostiato world jaffa
