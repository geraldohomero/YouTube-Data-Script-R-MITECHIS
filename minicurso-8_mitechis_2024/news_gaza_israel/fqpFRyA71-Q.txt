 
STREETS AND IN THE COUNTRY'S 
PARLIAMENT.
CTV'S INTERNATIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT PAUL WORKMAN HAS 
MORE.
PAUL, WHAT IS THE REASON PEOPLE
TURNING OUT REALLY IN HISTORIC 
NUMBERS ON THE STREETS OF 
ISRAEL?
>> Paul: WELL, FIRST OF ALL, 
MARCIA, THIS IS THE MOST 
SWEEPING POPULAR PROTESTS EVER 
IN ISRAEL SINCE THE FOUNDING OF
THE NATION 75 YEARS AGO.
IT IS A VERY SEVERE, DRAMATIC 
TEST OF THE GOVERNMENT OF 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WHO IS 
TRYING TO REFORM THE JUDICIAL 
SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY WHICH 
WOULD MAKE IT -- WHICH WOULD 
TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE 
JUDICIALS' INDEPENDENCE AND A 
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWD ARE 
THERE FROM ALL SORTS OF WALKS 
OF LIFE ACROSS ISRAEL SAYING 
THIS WOULD DAMAGE DEMOCRACY IN 
THE NATION.
THE STRUGGLE HAS BECOME ABOUT 
-- ABOUT EXACTLY THAT.
A VERY PROFOUND MOMENT IN 
ISRAEL'S HISTORY.
NETANYAHU WILL -- THERE HAVE 
BEEN LOTS OF REPORTS THIS 
MORNING THAT NETANYAHU WAS 
GOING TO STEP IN AND STOP THIS 
REFORM PROTEST BECAUSE OF THE 
CHAOS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
LARGELY AFTER WEEKS AND WEEKS 
OF PROTEST LIKE THIS.
HE RISKS POPULAR PROTEST OR THE
TOLERANCE OF HIS MINORITY 
GOVERNMENT.
U. 
>> Marcia: WHAT IS HIS POSITION
RIGHT NOW?
WHAT IS HE SAYING?
THE RISK IS LOSING THE 
GOVERNMENT HE PUT TOGETHER 
RECENTLY SOME OF THE FAR RIGHT 
MEMBERS WOULD ESSENTIALLY 
RESIGN, NOT PART THE COALITION 
ANY MORE.
THERE'S UMPTEEN ELECTIONS IN 
THE LAST DECADE OR SO IN THE 
COUNTRY.
IT IS A GRAVE CRISIS FOR 
NETANYAHU, FOR THE COUNTRY 
ITSELF.
MANY PEOPLE FEEL IT WOULD RISK 
THE JUDICIAL REFORM THEY GO 
THROUGH.
RISK DEMOCRACY.
WOULD RISK THE SECURITY OF 
ISRAEL.
SO THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT AT 
STAKE HERE.
