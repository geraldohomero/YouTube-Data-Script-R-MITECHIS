SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ON
THE UPPER EAST SIDE. MAYOR
ADAMS MAKING REMARKS OF ONE OF
THE MANY SYNAGOGUES OR SERVICES
ARE TAKING PLACE ON THIS FRIDAY
EVENING. CBS2'S KRISTIE
KELESHIAN OUTSIDE A TEMPLE
>> Reporter: GRANTING MEDIA
ACCESS INTO FRIDAY NIGHT
SERVICES, SOMETHING IT DOESN'T
ALWAYS DO. THE RABBI SAID IT
HAS TO DO A DIFFERENT APPROACH
LIKE THIS FOR THE COMMUNITY TO
GARNER SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE OF
ISRAEL . AND AS YOU SAID MAYOR
ADAMS SPOKE AT THE SERVICE
TONIGHT AGAINST EIGHT AND USED
THE ANALOGY OF RIVERS AND SEAS,
SAYING WHAT HE CALLS A CIVILIAN
ARMY, NEW YORKERS SHOULD WORK
INTO THE SEA OF HATE. IN
RESPONSE TO HATE SPEECH HE HAS
SEEN THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. HE
WANTS NEW YORKERS IN NEW YORK
TO BE SEEN AS A STANDARD OF HOW
OTHER IMMUNITIES ACROSS THE
GLOBE TACKLE HEAT.
>> WE SHOULD BE THE BEACON FOR
THE ENTIRE GLOBE. WHAT HAPPENS
IN NEW YORK SHOULD CASCADE
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
AND CASCADE THROUGHOUT THE
ENTIRE GLOBE. THIS DARK
MOMENT, THIS PAINFUL MOMENT,
WE MUST TURN IT TO A PURPOSEFUL
MOMENT.
>> IT IS IMPORTANT IN MOMENTS
OF TRAUMA FOR US TO BE
TOGETHER. WE FIND STRENGTH TO
BE TOGETHER. ALL OF US ARE PART
OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE. AND
ISRAEL IS OUR HOME.
>> Reporter: I ALSO HEARD FROM
ATTENDEES TONIGHT, JUST AHEAD
OF THE SERVICE TONIGHT. A LOT
OF THE ATTENDEES TOLD US THEY
WERE NERVOUS FOR THEIR SAFETY
WHEN COMING IN HERE. I ASSURE
YOU THAT THERE WAS QUITE A
HEAVY NYPD PRESENCE AROUND THE
TEMPLE ITSELF AND INSIDE. THIS
OF COURSE IS NOT THE ONLY
SERVICE TAKING PLACE TONIGHT.
YOU WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THE
SERVICES TAKING PLACE IN THE
CITY AND AS WELL IN NEW JERSEY,
TONIGHT AT 11:00. KRISTIE
