Ukraine President Valod Mir Jailonsky
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to Iron Dome Air Defense System
It was sought so that it was of Russia's air strikes
Could answer but Israel to Ukraine
At that time he refused to give iron dome
Israel had argued that if that iron
If Dome gives Ukraine to Iran
There was a danger of falling in hands because Russian
Army became western in Ukraine
Weapons reverse engineering to Iran
Was giving for it but in reality Israel
It was a big reason behind this decision
It was that Israel Russia President Vladimir
Did not want to offend Putin
Because the Russian army strong in Syria
There is a catch even the sky of Syrian
Russia controls
And the terrorist organization of Lebanon in Syria

Army carries air attack and Russia to Israel
It also gives his permission and if Netanyahu
If I gave Iron Dome to Ukraine, perhaps Putin

Ukraine is also fighting the war in Gaza
To support Israel openly
Ukraine has announced that he says
Israel of Israel against Hamas's terrorist attack
Stands with perseverance together and this is the reason

He is a criminal in the eyes of the whole world
Anyone who nourishes terror
Criminals in the eyes of the whole world
Let me tell you that Israel on Ukraine
Ukraine supports support in Russian invasion
But Netanyahu did Ukraine
Although Israel did not give weapons
Human help is given to Ukraine
