Janine refugee
camp only aat amori was at home when
Israeli soldiers burst through the
door there were no Palestinian Fighters
here she says but after the Israelis
ordered her out of her home they blew it
up the officer came and told me to get
out and put my hands up so I did we're
all shocked why did they target our home
we are three women we don't hide anyone
there's no resistance
here more than 23,000 people were caught
in the middle of one of the biggest
battles between the Israeli military and
Palestinian Fighters that there's been
in months in the occupied West
Bank 14 Palestinians were killed at
their funerals on Friday many fighters
were visible among the
mourners is Israel has been conducting
these sort of destructive raids for the
last four or five years to try and
suppress the different Palestinian
fighting groups but it's not working
instead it fuels resentment and anger
and provides recruits for these fighting
groups at sua lahu school 250 6 to 10
year old girls were trapped all day
during the
fighting sua tries to distract the girls
with games and Treats but loud
explosions and gunfire terrifies
them it affects their mental health it
creates fear Terror psychological
problems and disturbing Dreams they're
afraid to come to school we've lost
about a 100 students who've moved to
other schools and after yesterday more
will
leave more than 20 raids have been
carried out here since October the 7th
Israel's military says it was conducting
counterterrorism operations but the
destruction that comes with them like
the deliberate ripping up of Roads
punishes
