we begin with the Middle East where as 
we've told you Iran yesterday launched  
an air attack on Israel we get the latest 
from Imtiaz Tyab in Tel [Music] Aviv the  
sound of sirens pierced the night sky as a wave 
of Iranian weapons were intercepted over Israel
the Israeli military says it was targeted 
by more than 200 drones cruise and ballistic  
missiles so far we have intercepted and are 
continuing to inter to intercept dozens of  
attack drones as well as cruise missiles and 
ballistic missiles outside of Israel's border  
on the streets of ton pockets of celebration 
for the unprecedented attack it's the first  
time in history Iran has directly targeted Israeli 
territory the assault was in retaliation for an  
air strike by Israel on Iran's Consulate in the 
Syrian Capital Damascus early this month killing  
revolutionary guard officers including senior 
commanders while the attacks were being carried  
out the gravity of the coordinated strikes 
was clear as President Biden and his National  
Security team monitored events from the White 
House Situation Room and this move by Iran marks  
the most serious escalation in an already unstable 
Middle East following hamas's deadly October 7th  
attacks which triggered Israel's massive assault 
on Gaza which has laid waste to the besieged  
Palestinian territory and already killed tens of 
thousands in a statement Iran's mission to the UN  
said the matter can be deemed concluded however 
should the Israeli regime make another mistake  
Iran's response will be considerably more severe 
despite initial reports of only limited damage the  
country says it will respond it's only a question 
of how and when President Biden has vowed Ironclad  
support for Israel but has also appealed for 
restraint appeals which have largely been  
ignored by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
over the past 6 months the fear now is this  
could be the beginning of a dangerous escalation 
that has the potential to spiral out of control
