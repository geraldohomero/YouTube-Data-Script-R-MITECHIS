Mos√©n is a 72 -year -old Argentine who
A long time ago he lives in Israel is more
He is a peace activist in this
situation that has been lived for many
years at the Gaza Strip was in his
Shelter as he never entered his
Home kidnapped him took him to
Gaza Strip because they were going to enter it
there to kidnap the people who
They had kidnapped it did not know which one was going
To be his answer that he was to
Gaza strip we do not enter we are going to
Listen to the survival testimony
From this Argentine
Rosen the shelter itself is a cabin
solid to deal with missiles
But this is another type of situation and in
the moment we are trying to
offer resistance in the sense of
avoid
What strange people can attempt
enter but at the moment they
They shot with their kalashnikov huh about
Let's say the Picaporte
eh the door
We opened we were injured
Bala obviously
eh my hands because it was support
The door my fortunately lord in
lesser extent and I with greater seriousness
eh because machine -grooming affected all
my hand huh and force us to go out and
accompany them and from the moment
of
That violent encounter us
They announce us that we are going to Gaza
The part of the part of them is in Arabic
And and from my part in English but in
Reality is not a conversation
fluid because we handle ourselves with signs
They mark us there and while
Come on while they drag us while
They push us while we are going
walking eh they say agasa and I
I say I show you that the way in
that they looked
so serious for hemorrhage eh and why
The wound is open that I
I need some kind of medical care
Hey
Of course this did not do them not
impact
mainly
