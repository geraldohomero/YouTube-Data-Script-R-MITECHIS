it's a symbol of how divided these two
societies have become the separation
barrier between israel and palestinian
land cuts into the occupied west bank
israel built it in the wake of the
second intifada as a so-called security
measure but it's left many palestinians
like issa ahmed living in its shadow
it restricted our movement we used to
move freely but now we're in an area
with restrictions dr maria bilharde says
the second intifada grew out of
frustration over the collapse of the
peace process in 2000 failure of camp
david the struggle for power between
barak and sharon and the idea of sharon
telling the world
i want to share it by force al-aqsa
mosque
and he provoked the whole world
especially the palestinians by entering
the site with 3 000 soldiers
what followed had a dramatic effect on
israel-palestine relations unlike the
first intifada palestinian tactics now
focused on suicide bombings rocket
attacks and sniper fire which israel met
with even deadlier force
the conflict ended in 2005 but not
before more than 3 000 palestinians were
killed
at first ibrahim mahmoud balusha didn't
believe his son had been hit by israeli
shelling until he found
when we finally found him we couldn't
recognize him because his face was
swollen from the shrapnel that hit him
in the back of the head he is not a
resistance fighter and did not get
involved in anything
more than one thousand israelis were
also killed roby demelan's son was among
them
when the army came to tell me
that david had been killed by a
palestinian sniper
the first thing i said i don't remember
this but this is what i'm told is you
may not kill anybody in the name of my
child one palestinian killed my child
not the whole palestinian nation
damelin then joined other families as
part of a group called the parents
circle families forum that focuses on
peace and reconciliation if we ever have
a peace political agreement there has to
be a clause for a reconciliation process
otherwise it's just another ceasefire
until the next time
she hopes speaking on the same stage as
palestinian mothers will serve as a
powerful voice for peace especially as
tensions over al-aqsa mosque grow
threatening to become a point once again
and drive the two sides even further
