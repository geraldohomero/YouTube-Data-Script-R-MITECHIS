question on the israeli-palestinian
conflict after finishing remarks on his
vaccination policy mr president will you
now insist upon a ceasefire given the
escalation of violence we've seen over
the weekend
i'll be speaking with the prime minister
in an hour and i'll be able to talk to
you after that
meanwhile as secretary of state anthony
blinken urged all sides to protect
civilians while on a diplomatic trip to
denmark
this coming after israel launched an
airstrike in a high-rise building
housing media including the associated
press amidst international criticism
that the u.s is not doing enough the
united states remains
greatly concerned by uh
by the violence by the escalating
violence
hundreds of people uh killed or injured
uh including
children being pulled uh from the rubble

region has seen in recent years
she did not give a direct answer when
questioned about the biden
administration's approval of 735 million
dollars in precision-guided weapons to
israel saying only it was approved
earlier in may the sale has come under
criticism by some house democrats it is
going to require both parties wanting to
engage in that and wanting to have a
discussion about the path forward and
who would be the point person from this
end we're certainly not quite there yet
it will be up to both parties to decide
if they want to move forward on that
pathway she also reiterated president
biden's commitment to a negotiated
two-state solution as the best path
forward
but as the war rages on and civilian
casualties mount the pressure is
building on president biden
