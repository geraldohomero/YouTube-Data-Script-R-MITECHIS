Attacks by the Yemeni Houthi militant group 
on ships in the Red Sea are forcing freight  
firms to reroute in order to avoid the Suez Canal.
This video was released by the Houthis on November  
20... showing armed men dropping from a helicopter 
and seizing a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea. 
The latest attacks came Monday when 
the Houthis said drones were launched  
against two cargo vessels in the area.
The Iran-aligned Houthis said the attacks  
are a response to Israel’s assault on 
the Gaza Strip, which Israel launched  
after the Oct. 7 rampage by Hamas militants.
The situation has prompted the United States  
and its allies to create a multinational 
operation to conduct joint patrols in the  
southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
In Israel on Monday, US Defense Secretary  
Lloyd Austin said no group or state 
should test America's resolve. 
In the Red Sea, we're leading a 
multinational maritime task force  
to uphold the bedrock principle of freedom of 
navigation. Iran's support for Houthi attacks  
on commercial vessels must stop.
The attacks have shown the ability  
of Middle Eastern paramilitary forces 
backed by Iran to upset global trade. 
Several major freight companies have 
begun sailing around Africa due to the  
danger and there are signs the crisis is 
broadening to include energy shipments. 
The rerouting adds costs and delays, 
which industry analysts expect to  
be compounded over the coming weeks.
While freight rates will likely increase  
on the longer voyages, the head of global freight 
platform Freightos said it is unlikely that rates  
will spike to the levels seen during the pandemic.
About 15% of world shipping traffic transits via  
the Suez Canal, the shortest shipping 
route between Europe and Asia.
