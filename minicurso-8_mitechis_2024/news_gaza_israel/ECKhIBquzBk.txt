thank you and Shalom
it is wonderful to be here in Israel
President Rivlin
mrs. Rivlin Prime Minister Netanyahu
mrs. Netanyahu thank you very much I
am deeply grateful for your invitation
on my first trip overseas as president I
have come to the sacred and ancient land
to reaffirm the unbreakable bond between
the United States and the State of
Israel
in this land so rich in history
Israel has built one of the world's
great
civilizations a strong resilient
determined and
prosperous nation
it is also a nation forged in the
commitment that we will never allow the
horrors and atrocities of the last
century to be repeated
now we must work together to build a
future where the nations of the region
are at peace and all of our children can
grow and
grow up strong and grow up free from
terrorism and violence
during my travels in recent days I have
found new reasons for hope I have just
concluded a visit to Saudi Arabia
where yesterday I met with King Salman
and with the leaders from across the
Muslim and
Arab world in that visit we reached
historic agreements to pursue
greater and greater cooperation in the
fight against terrorism and its evil
ideology
my future travels will take me to visit
Pope Francis at the Vatican and then our
NATO and European allies
we have before us a rare
opportunity to bring security and
stability and peace to this region and
to its people
defeating terrorism and creating a
future of harmony prosperity and peace
but we can only get there working
together there is no other way
mr. president mr. prime minister I look
forward to working closely with both of
you during my stay
we love Israel we respect Israel and I
send your people the warmest greetings
from your friend and Ally all of the
people in the United States of America
we are with you thank you and god bless
you thank you
you
