This is one of the very concrete evidence
that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is
putting all the near East
Under tension yesterday a navy ship
French who sailed in the Red Sea
been targeted by drones drones
belonging to an Islamist group
Yemenite The tools are support for
Hamas and Iran and they say they are threatening
Now any boat that is going
towards the Helena Helena state from
Paturo is this navy ship
French who was targeted at night
last twice by
Drone attacks from Yemeni rebels
The devices hung out the Red Sea by
from northern Yemen they were
intercepted by these French soldiers
The Langedoc multimission frigate of the
Navy has shot two drones
who were headed straight on her in
from the coasts of
Yemen a few hours earlier
rebels tools an ally Islamist group
Hamas and Iran threatened
to attack in the Red Sea in
direction
of Israel we will prevent the passage of
all ships that will go to
the Zionist entity if help
humanitarian aid is not allowed to enter
in the band of
Gaza a few weeks ago they
had assumed this merchant ship
Israeli and its 25 crew members
As we can see in these images of
propaganda the rebels' attacks
composed by sea at sea
Crucial omque red where 9 % of the
World oil traffic in the United States
As France have interests
strategic if the ships do not pass
not by this strait they will have to
go around the whole African continent this
which means that transport will
take twice three times more
long but above all will cost
Much more and so you can
Imagine the consequences for
production for energy costs
in Europe and other parts of
world over the weeks the tools have
multiplied drones and
Missiles targeting Israel all intercepted
By Tal behind this offensive
military the shadow of the Iranian ally we
knows that Desou benefits from system
Iranian weapons and and engineering
because we found components in
Made in missiles and drones
that they sent to Saudi Arabia which
very clearly came from Iran a risk
climbing conflict in the Red Sea is
taken very seriously by the United States
and France that have strengthened their
Aeronaval presence in recent
weeks
