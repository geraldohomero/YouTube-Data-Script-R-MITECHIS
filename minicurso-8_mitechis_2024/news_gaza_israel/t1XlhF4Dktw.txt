german chancellor olaf schultz has
expressed his disgust over the holocaust
comments made by palestinian president
mahmoud abbas while in germany schultz
tweeted i am disgusted by the outrageous
remarks for us germans in particular any
revitalization of the singularity of the
holocaust is intolerable and
unacceptable i condem any attempt to
deny the crimes of the holocaust
abbas made the comments on tuesday where
he compared israel's alleged crimes to
one of the darkest moments in german
history
from 1947 to the present day israel has
committed 50 massacres in palestinian
villages and cities
in their yasin tantura kapharkasam and
many others
50 massacres 50 holocausts
and until today and every day there are
casualties killed by the israeli
military
our request is to say enough come
towards peace
israel's caretaker prime minister yed
lapid also called out abbas for his
comments lapid tweeted mahmoud abbas
accusing israel of having committed 50
holocausts while standing on german soil
is not only a moral disgrace but a
monstrous lie
six million jews were murdered in the
holocaust including one and a half
million jewish children
reacting to the criticism the
palestinian president has issued a
statement he called the nazi holocaust
the most heinous crime in modern human
history and added that he aimed to
highlight the crimes and massacres
committed against the palestinian people
since the nakba at the hands of israeli
forces nakba or catastrophe is the term
that palestinians used to describe the
mass exodus following the 1948 war and
the corresponding creation of israel
our correspondent jody cohen has sent us
this report from kefar sabha in israel
with an estimated maximum of 116
000 people killed on both sides of the
arab israeli conflict since the 1920s
and with 6 million jews murdered in the
holocaust not only is abbas comments
seen as inaccurate it's also deeply
offensive to many people chancellor
schultz is said to be angry that he
wasn't given the opportunity to respond
to the comments as it was made and he's
facing severe criticism in germany for
staying silent at the time this is jody
