in the besieged gaza strip
towers were reduced to rubble leaving
dozens of palestinians missing and dead
the search for bodies is a primitive one
and may last for days
while israel's iron dome largely funded
by the united states intercepts rockets
launched from gaza these israelis took
shelter in a car park where one of them
appeared wounded
the israeli prime minister warned of a
bloody and prolonged military operation
to come
hamas and islamic jihad have paid and i
tell you here they will pay a very heavy
price for their regression i say here
tonight blood beyond their heads
but leaders in gaza say they've already
won
israeli forces have ruled back attacks
on the al-aqsa mosque an israel supreme
court has postponed hearings on the
forced expulsions of palestinians from
their homes and occupied east jerusalem
we've achieved a victory in the battle
of defending alcots the palestinian
people won't allow israeli settlers to
storm the al-aqsa mosque we're ready to
pay for this with our lives
in washington the biden administration
maintained the traditional u.s position
equating both sides calling for calm and
condemning the rockets launched from
gaza and by israel's right to defend
itself we also stand by the principle
that palestinians deserve the right to
live
in safety and security
[Applause]
palestine outside pro-palestinian
protesters demanded the u.s use its
leverage to stop israel's air strikes
similar demonstrations took place in new
york where scuffles broke out between
the two sides
back in gaza palestinians are meant to
be preparing for the idol fitter holiday
with so many lives lost there will be
little to celebrate
