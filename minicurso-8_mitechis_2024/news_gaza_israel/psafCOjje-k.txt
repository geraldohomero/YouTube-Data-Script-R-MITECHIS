TALK TO US ABOUT THIS MOVE FROM
TEHRAN.
HOW SERIOUS OF AN ESCALATION IS
THIS?
>> I THINK THE WARSHIP IRAN
SENT IS RELATIVELY SMALL
COMPARED TO THE U.S.
FORCES.
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHEN THIS
IS HAPPENING.
IT IS HAPPENING AMONG ALREADY
INCREASED TENSIONS IN THE RED
SEA. THERE IS A U.S.
LED PLAN TO TRY TO PROTECT
SHIPPING IN THIS AREA WHERE
THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE
ATTACKS BY IRANIAN BACKED
GROUPS ON VESSELS AFFECTING
GLOBAL SHIPPING.
IT IS THE TIMING THAT IS
INTERESTING.
AND THE FACT THAT AT THIS
CURRENT TIME, IF YOU HAVE A LOT
OF MILITARY SHIPS, U.S.
ONES FROM ALLIED FORCES AND
IRAN IN VERY TIGHT AREAS AND
WHERE AREAS WHERE SHIPPING IS
VERY CROWDED.
THAT IS ALWAYS THE CONCERN IN
THESE AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE
NARROW AREAS OF GLOBAL SHIPPING
OR PLACES WHERE THERE IS A
MOVEMENT OF GOODS, THE MORE
MILITARY SHIPS THAT ENTER INTO
THAT SPACE A HIGHER THE RISK OF
SOMETHING HAPPENING EVEN IF IT
IS QUITE SMALL, IT COULD GROW
INTO SOMETHING QUITE BIGGER.
KRITI: YOU DO HAVE AN AMERICAN
MILITARY PRESENCE BUT THERE ARE
ALSO A LOT OF SHIPPING LINES
AND CONTAINER FLOWS PAUSING IN
THE REGION.
THAT BRINGS UP HOW MUCH U.S.
MILITARY PRESENCE ACTUALLY
MATTERS.
AND ISRAEL CUTTING THE SIZE OF
FORCES IN GAZA.
IS THIS A NEW PHASE OF THE WAR
WITH HAMAS?
>> IT DOES APPEAR TO BE THIS
WAY.
IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THE TANGIBLE
GOALS WOULD BE FOR ISRAEL AND
ITS INVASION OF GAZA.
THEY MADE A CLEAR THAT THEY
WOULD NOT STOP UNTIL THEY HAD
DESTROYED HAMAS IN GAZA BUT
WHAT THAT MEANT EXACTLY WAS
STILL UNCLEAR.
DID IT JUST MEAN TAKING OUT TOP
LEADERSHIP?
ERADICATING ALL OF THE GROUP?
IT IS A DIFFICULT TASK TO
FULFILL WITH UNCLEAR BOUNDARIES.
THIS LOOKS LIKE A STARTING OF
PULLING OUT.
IT IS INTERESTING THAT THERE
ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY THEY
MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS.
ONE OF THE
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE
GOVERNMENT IS TALKING ABOUT IS
THAT THE ARMY IS LARGELY IN
CONTROL OF NORTHERN GAZA.
AND THERE HAS ALSO BEEN U.S.
PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO WITHDRAW.
THERE ARE ALSO ECONOMIC REASONS.
SUSTAINING THE LEVEL OF COMBAT
IS BECOMING VERY EXPENSIVE FOR
ISRAEL WHICH IS ANOTHER FACTOR.
IT DOES LOOK LIKE WE ARE
ENTERING ANOTHER PHASE.
IN THE END IT WAS UNCLEAR WHEN
THEY WOULD WITHDRAW BUT IT DOES
SEEM LIKE GRADUALLY WE ARE
ENTERING INTO A NEW PHASE.
