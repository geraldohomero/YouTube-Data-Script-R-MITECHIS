>> Omar: GOOD EVENING,
EVERYONE.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A
DEVASTATING TRAGEDY IN A COUNTRY
ALREADY BATTERED BY THE
BRUTALITY OF WAR.
A HELICOPTER CRASHED NEAR A
KINDERGARTEN IN UKRAINE.
AT LEAST 14 PEOPLE ARE DEAD,
INCLUDING A CHILD.
AND A TOP GOVERNMENT MINISTER
WHO WAS ON BOARD.
THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED AS
CANADA'S DEFENSE MINISTER WAS IN
THE UKRAINIAN CAPITAL WHERE SHE
ANNOUNCED NEW MILITARY VEHICLES
ARE ON THE WAY.
CTV'S DANIELLE HAMAMDJIAN
REPORTS FROM KYIV TONIGHT.
>> Reporter: THE SCENE WAS
LIKE AN INFERNO.
BUT THERE WERE NO AIR RAID
SIRENS BEFORE THIS EXPLOSION.
SHORTLY AFTER 8 IN THE MORNING
IN THE SUBURB OF KYIV AND JUST
AS PARENTS WERE DROPPING OFF
CHILDREN AT THIS NURSERY A
HELICOPTER WITH NINE PEOPLE ON
BOARD CRASHED AT THE SITE.
THE CAUSE IS NOW UNDER
INVESTIGATION.
WE HEARD SCREAMS, CHILDREN WERE
RUNNING AROUND AND WE BEGAN TO
HELP, SAID THIS YOUNG MAN.
THEY WERE PASSING CHILDREN OVER
THE FENCE AND WE MANAGED TO TAKE
THREE OF THEM.
THIS LITTLE GIRL IS AMONG THE
SURVIVORS.
BUT AMONG THOSE KILLED, THE
HIGHEST RANKING UKRAINIAN
OFFICIAL TO DIE SINCE THE WAR
BEGAN.
THE INTERIOR MINISTER...
THIS IS ALL SO A PERSONAL
TRAGEDY FOR ME SAID HIS
COLLEAGUE, THE DEFENSE MINISTER,
AS WE WERE CLOSE FRIENDS.
HE SAID THANK YOU.
ON HER FIRST VISIT HERE SINCE
RUSSIA'S INVASION CANADIAN
DEFENSE MINISTER ANITA ANAND
CAME WITH MORE MILITARY
ASSISTANCE TO OFFER.
200 ADDITIONAL ARMORED PERSONAL
CARRIERS MADE IN MISSISSAUGA
WORTH $90 MILLION, PART OF HALF
A BILLION DOLLAR AID PACKAGE
ANNOUNCED IN THE FALL.
>> THESE VEHICLES ALSO ALLOW FOR
THE SAFE TRANSPORTATION OF
PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT AND
MEDICAL EVACUATIONS, ALSO THEY
ARE EQUIPPED WITH SMART TECH,
AND THAT HELPS SOLDIERS TO
DETECT THREATS EARLY.
>> Reporter: BUT UKRAINE HAS
MADE IT CLEAR, WHAT'S AT THE TOP
OF ITS WISH LIST ARE TANKS,
SPECIFICALLY THE LEOPARD BATTLE
TANK MADE IN GERMANY.
AS OPPOSED TO ARMORED VEHICLES,
THEY ARE USED TO BREAK ENEMY
LINES.
ADDRESSING THE WORLD ECONOMIC
FORUM FROM KYIV, PRESIDENT
ZELENSKYY...
>> SUPPLIES MUST OUTPACE RUSSIAN
ATTACKS.
>> CANADA IS AMONG THE COUNTRIES
THAT OWN LEOPARD TANKS BUT IN
ORDER TO GIVE THEM TO UKRAINE,
GERMANY, WHERE THE TANKS
ORIGINATED, HAS TO APPROVE IT.
SOMETHING IT HAS SO FAR RESISTED
FOR FEAR OF BEING PERCEIVED OF
ESCALATING THE CONFLICT AND
