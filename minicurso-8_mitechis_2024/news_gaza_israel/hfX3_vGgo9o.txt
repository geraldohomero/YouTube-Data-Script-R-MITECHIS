 
MUCH MORE IF OCCULT. 
>> PLEASE STANDBY. 
WE WANT TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 
NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT 
DAVID MARTIN WHO JOINS US NOW 
FROM THE PENTAGON. 
DAVID, PLEASE WEIGH IN ON YOUR 
THOUGHTS AND WHAT YOU ARE 
HEARING ON ALL OF THIS. 
>> THESE INTENSIFIED STRIKES 
AND THE GROUND MOVEMENTS THAT 
THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES ARE 
CONFIRMING, THEY ARE SAYING 
THEY ARE EXPANDING THEIR GROUND 
OPERATIONS, WHAT WE MAY BE 
SEEING HERE IS A ROLLING START 
TO THE GROUND INVASION OF GAZA. 
WE HAVE ALL BEEN SORT OF 
SITTING HERE THINKING IT IS 
GOING TO BE 1 TO 3 AND THEN 
UNDER AGE OUR HEADS AND 
EVERYBODY GOES AT ONCE. 
BUT IN MILITARY OPERATIONS, IT 
PROBABLY MAKES MORE SENSE TO 
JUST KEEP INCREASING THE NUMBER 
OF INCURSIONS GOING DEEPER EACH 
TIME AND WITH GREATER FORCE, 
AND THEN INSTEAD OF WITHDRAWING 
AFTER YOU HAVE ACHIEVED 
WHATEVER YOUR OBJECTIVE WAS, 
STAYING. 
IN EFFECT, ESTABLISHING 
BEACHHEADS INSIDE GAZA. 
AND THEN YOU CAN REINFORCE THE 
BEACHHEADS WHICH ARE SO SHOWING 
SUCCESS AND YOU CAN WITHDRAW 
FROM THE BEACHHEADS WHERE YOU 
ARE MEETING STIFFER THAN 
EXPECTED OPPOSITION. 
WE HAVE ALL BEEN THINKING OF 
THIS AS AN ALL OR NOTHING 
PROPOSITION AND WHAT WE MAY BE 
WITNESSING HERE, THE IDF SAYS 
THEY ARE EXPANDING GROUND 
OPERATION. 
WHAT WE MAY BE WITNESSING IS 
ACTUALLY A ROLLING START TO THE 
GROUND INVASION.>> HOW DOES 
THIS CUP LOCATE THE U.S. ROLE 
IN ALL OF THIS?>> EVERYBODY 
EXPECTS THAT ONCE A GROUND 
INVASION BEGINS THAT IRAN WILL 
INCITE ALL OF ITS PROXIES TO 
TAKE FURTHER ACTION HEZBOLLAH 
AND LEBANON TO TAKE ADDITIONAL 
SHOTS ACROSS THE BORDER INTO 
NORTHERN ISRAEL. 
AND FOR ALL OF THESE PRO-
IRANIAN MILITIAS THAT ARE 
SPRINKLED ACROSS IRAQ AND 
SYRIA, TO INCREASE THEIR 
ATTACKS ON THE BASES WHERE U.S. 
TROOPS ARE LOCATED. 
THE MOST IMMEDIATE IMPACT COULD 
BE INCREASED ATTACKS ON 
AMERICAN TROOPS IN THE REGION. 
AND THAT OF COURSE IS WHY THE 
U.S. HAS BEEN SENDING 
ADDITIONAL AIR DEFENSE TO THE 
PERSIAN GULF, AND BY A SECOND 
AIRCRAFT CARRIER IS ON THE WAY, 
ALTHOUGH THAT HAS QUITE SOME 
WAYS TO GO BEFORE IT GETS TO 
THE AREA AROUND THE PERSIAN 
GULF. 
>> WE HAVE BEEN COVERING THE 
RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT ISRAEL 
IS GOING TO EXPAND THEIR 
OPERATIONS TONIGHT. 
WE HAVE HEARD FROM HAMAS SAYING 
THEIR CALL TO ARMS. 
WE HAVE BEEN BREAKING
