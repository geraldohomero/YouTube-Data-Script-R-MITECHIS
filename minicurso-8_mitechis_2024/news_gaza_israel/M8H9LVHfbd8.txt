We will have more than 300 applications for
repatriation at this time we have more
because the number increases and increases and
Increase what Colombia decided
because we have to answer is ours
Responsibility The President gave
specific instructions is to do the
repatriation we are making a great
effort with the aerospace force of
Colombia and tomorrow we have a first
flight that arrives in Bengu and is going to leave
At approximately 10:30 in the morning
With the former the 108 Colombians
tourists among those in a very
special because they are older people or
families with children people with some
special medical condition within that
group of tourists who were passing
In Israel that group comes out tomorrow and a
Second group is going to leave on Friday
The conditions allow us and also
Well, we have until today
The fortune of saying that there was no
dead Colombian citizen but
unfortunate
Imón who was the girl who was in the
party in the south near the border
With Gaza during that terrible attack
He disappeared with her boyfriend and she was
CITIZAN COLOMBO ISRAELÍ THE PARENTS
They immediately contacted the
authorities in his despair
We try to accompany them we did the
contacts and they were tested
DNA and today it was confirmed in effect that she
was within the people who
They found dead and not yet
We have news of her boyfriend
Then we assume that it may be
kidnapped as reput but that is a
possibility eh that we cannot in this
Moment also confirm
We have another constituency
We have care and
Colombian assistance in
Palestine in the territories occupied in
sis Jordan and Gaza of course
That creates some more challenges
older huh we have a family in gauze
that is in a situation too
complicated because she is a mother with two
children and we have not been able to get it
That has been able to leave that
We are managing them with our
Consulate of our Embassy in Egypt
And the people who are in
Bethlehem or in Ramela they will be able to be
repatriated eh we have
security guarantees by
Israel that controls the territories of
that these people can come to
airport and go on our flights
repatriation when we go to
Require that is like the overview
that I can give you right now
