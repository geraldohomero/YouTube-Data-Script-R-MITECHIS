And President Biden
is in Israel today,
meeting with the country's
wartime cabinet.
It's a show of solidarity
as Israel's military
preps for a ground offensive
against Hamas.
Nb C's. Jay Gray is in
Tel Aviv this morning.
Good morning, President Biden
on the ground here
in Tel Aviv.
Though the scope of his trip
has changed dramatically
during his time in the
air to get here.
He is of course meeting with
Israeli leaders and their war
cabinet later
in the day.
What he will not be doing is
holding a summit
with his
Arab allies here.
He will not make a trip to
Jordan that was initially
planned and all of that was
designed to really
talk about
and try to tamp down any
violence from spreading
into a wider military conflict
across the region.
Of course, there is big concern
right now in the northern
border with Lebanon.
As we see
troops and equipment building
at that border,
we've seen firing back
and forth between the
two sides with casualties
on both sides with
soldiers involved there.
And so that's something that
everyone is watching
very closely and
the tension as well as the
fighting escalating
there right now,
hundreds killed in that blast
overnight at a hospital
in Gaza.
You've got Hamas blaming
Israeli airstrikes
for that.
You've got Israel saying it was
a failed rocket launch
by Islamic jihadists.
And the problem
with this is perception is
driving a lot of what
is happening here.
You've got the perception of
all these airstrikes that
have been
going on
from the IDF and then you've
got the hospital that
is subject to what happened
there overnight.
And so the rest of the world is
watching this and wondering
exactly who's
to blame.
It's led to protests
across this region
and those protests are going to
continue throughout the
day here again,
a very different and very
tenuous trip
for the
president who is now
on the ground here.
That's the latest from here
in Tel Aviv. I'm
Jay Gray
back to you now.
