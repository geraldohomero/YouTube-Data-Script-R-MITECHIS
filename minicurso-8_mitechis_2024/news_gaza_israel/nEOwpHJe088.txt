Mr. Vishwa is connected to tell complete
Know what happened to you
If I tell them their details, then many of them
Especially musical shows in reality shows
I have always seen the dholak player
Girish ji will know from you directly that you
The first thing is to tell that you
What you saw during which you were trapped
But it means 6:30 am
We were sleeping so strongly
We got up from the blast and when they woke up
As we came out of the hotel, we came to the lobby
The siren was ringing of the hotel and there
People were the hotel to go to the bunker of the hotel
We were speaking for a lot of chaos
I took my group Vishwa Rockers
We had our Israel show on 2 October
The show was after that sorry on October 4
The show had left 4 from here on the date
After showing the date, we five more
When six stopped to roam there, we
Claimed in many places everywhere
Came and came on 7th at 12:00 pm
Was going to leave at 12:00 pm
Wors were woke up from the blast at 6:30 am and
Such a strong scream injury kids girls
All of women who stayed there in the hotel
Everything with me also female singer top part
Bhagwatu Ulla was Sharad Sharma Saragama Fame Woh
Singer was Chetan Rane was my musical
The whole group was a 10 -man team
So the responsibility of the entire 10 men
I was so nervous about thinking that now
What is the atmosphere that means missiles
Missiles are running there hotel lobby
We are seeing in the bunker
When people were, it would have been a little sound
We used to come out for a while
When I used to come and see this in the sky above
Missiles are running here on Diwali
Rockets go on means big pain
I was so nervous that 10
I have brought the man how to take
Will go and leave at 12:00 and 6:30
Taking it from o'clock in the explosion
Missiles had Sablu
