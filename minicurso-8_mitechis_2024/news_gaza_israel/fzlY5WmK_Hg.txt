minute by minute beyond
efforts from any of the most
IMPORTANT I SAY MINUTE TO
minute the situation is aggravated in the middle
East and there is more and more fear that
The conflict scales at the regional level and
that begin to participate in fact already
The other Arab countries is happening
that surround Israel in this case we are going to
talk about Lebanon because tanks and
Israel military armored
distribute along the entire border
the presence of uniformed that has
replaced civilians since these
small communities glued and that
Limitan have become a town
ghost after having already evacuated all the
population before the growing threat of
The Shiite militia
Hisbol the dividing between Israel and the
Lebanon lives its greatest exchange of
fire since 2006 and threatens
become a second front into
parallel to Gaza where the troops
Israelis fight the presence of never
which has forced the evacuation of
More than 60,000 people over 240
km border before missile dripping
Morter and
projectiles of the last 25 days
the peoples less than 5 km from the
DIVISORY In addition to the city of Kirat
Shmona with a population of 25,000
Inhabitants just 10 km from Lebanon are
empty of people for more than one
week by order of the authorities
Israelis and that border is in
His most tense moment as we said
Only since 2006 when troops
Israelis and the Hisbol have already fought a
War with an intense exchange of
fire that has not ceased since 8
October one day after it began
The war with the Islamist militias of
Gaza can be said that
Lebanon is already actively participating
From this contest yesterday and in the last
Hours has joined Yemen for that reason I say
that is growing and is already starting to
be a regional conflict especially with
This front that Israel has with the
Lebanon where is nothing more or anything
Less than Ges
ball
