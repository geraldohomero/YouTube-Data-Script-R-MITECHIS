Are we any closer to a ceasefire at this
point or have those talks now been
derailed?
Hi, Tom.
It seems as if we're not.
A deal is not imminent.
There's no signal yet that Israel is
going to send negotiators to to Cairo.
Yesterday it did.
It's now been three days that it's
delayed this decision.
Israel is saying that it needs it wants
Hamas to give it essentially a breakdown
of the well-being of the remaining
hostages and also letting it know how
many of them are still alive.
That is something that is very unclear.
Israeli sources had previously said they
thought about 100 hostages were still
alive in in in Gaza.
The number may be a lot less.
And they want to know what the status of
of those captors is before they send a
high level delegation to to Cairo.
And there is still a lot that the two
sides need to work out, although and
they have they have broadly agreed to
something like a 35 or 40 day ceasefire
in return for about 40 hostages being
released.
A lot of details still need to be ironed
out.
The bigger picture here is that Hamas
would like almost certainly like a cease
fire that's long lasting, whereas Israel
does not.
Keep saying that whatever truce is
agreed to should only be short lived.
As I said, maybe around six weeks.
But then after that, the war must
continue.
Israel argues that it has no choice but
to continue fighting until Hamas is
destroyed.
And there are still some several
thousand fighters, at least
from the group.
And most of those,
we believe, are holed up in Rafah in the
southern city that's close to the
Egyptian border.
And Israel says that and a ground
offensive on that city, on Rafah must
must happen at some stage.
If there is a truce, those plans might
be changed.
But for now, Israel is is sticking to
its stance that an offensive on Rafah
must happen.
