CLEARING THE ENCAMPMENT.
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. WE
WILL BE ASKING MAYOR ADAMS MORE
ABOUT THESE PROTESTS TOMORROW
MORNING AT 7:45 IN STREAMING ON
CBS NEWS YOU NEW YORK.
>>> POLL SHOWS AMERICANS ARE
DIVIDED ON SENDING AID TO
ISRAEL. 46% OF VOTERS SAY THEY
ARE IN SUPPORT WHILE 44% OPPOSE
SENDING MORE AID.
>> THIS COMES AS POPE FRANCIS
SPEAKS EXCLUSIVELY TO CBS NEWS
ABOUT THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR.
>> INDEED, IT IS EXTREMELY RARE
FOR THE POPE TO GRANT A SITDOWN
INTERVIEW, BUT HE SPOKE TO
NORAH O'DONNELL ABOUT HIS
FEELINGS ABOUT THE CONFLICT AS
THE WAR IS ALREADY IN HIS SEVEN
MONTH. THIS, AS HAMAS RELEASES
ANOTHER HOSTAGE VIDEO SHOWING
AN ISRAELI AMERICAN CITIZEN
WITH A DEVASTATING INJURY.
>> CAN YOU HELP NEGOTIATE
PEACE?
>> I CAN PRAY. I DO, I PRAY A
LOT.
EXCLUSIVELY TO NORAH O'DONNELL
ABOUT THE HAMAS WAR. THE POPE
HAS CONDEMNED HAMAS' OCTOBER
7th ATTACK BUT HE IS ALSO
CALLED ON ISRAEL TO USE
RESTRAINT.
>> THERE ARE NO PICTURES OF
STARVING CHILDREN COMING OUT OF
GAZA. WHAT OF THOSE THAT CALL
THAT A GENOCIDE?
>> Translator: GENOCIDE . EVERY
AFTERNOON AT 7:00 P.M., I
CALLED GAZA TO THE PARISH.
THERE ARE ABOUT 600 PEOPLE
THERE AND THEY TELL ME WHAT IS
GOING ON. IT IS VERY HARD.
VERY, VERY HARD. FOOD GOES IN,
BUT THEY HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT.
IT IS VERY HARD.
>> THE PONTIFF'S COMMENTS COME
AS HAMAS RELEASED A PROPAGANDA
VIDEO. IT SHOWS AMERICAN IS
REALLY HOSTAGE HIRSCH GOLDBERG:
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE
OCTOBER 7th ATTACK. CBS NEWS
CANNOT CONFIRM WHEN THE VIDEO
WAS TAKEN OR WHAT PRESSURE
PULLEN MAY HAVE BEEN UNDER TO
RECORD IT. HIS PARENTS WEARING
TAPE MARKING THE NUMBER OF DAYS
HE'S BEEN GONE, WERE
OVERWHELMED.
>> HIRSCH, IF YOU CAN HEAR
THIS, WE HEARD YOUR VOICE TODAY
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 201 DAYS
TELLING YOU, WE ARE TELLING YOU
WE LOVE YOU. STAY STRONG.
SURVIVE.
>> POLAND WAS BADLY WOUNDED
DURING THE HAMAS ATTACK AND
LOST PART OF HIS ARM. WE ARE
RELIEVED TO SEE HIM ALIVE BUT
ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT HIS HEALTH
AND WELL-BEING AS WELL AS THAT
OF ALL THE OTHER HOSTAGES AND
ALL OF THOSE SUFFERING IN THIS
REGION.
>> REPORTS SAY THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION RECEIVED THE
HOSTAGE VIDEO MONDAY TWO DAYS
BEFORE HAMAS MADE PUBLIC. THE
EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION
