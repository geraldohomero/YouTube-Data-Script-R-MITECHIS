GRAB SOME LEFTOVERS, BECAUSE
"EARLY TODAY" STARTS RIGHT NOW
I'M JESSICA LAYTON
WE BEGIN THIS MORNING WITH
BREAKING NEWS OVERNIGHT.
THE FIRST PAUSE IN FIGHTING
SINCE THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR BEGAN
IS UNDER WAY
AFTER WEEKS OF NEGOTIATIONS, A
DEAL HAS BEEN REACHED, AND IT
WILL BEGIN WITH THE RELEASE OF
13 HOSTAGES FROM GAZA IN JUST
HOURS.
AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT, ISRAEL
WILL ADHERE TO A FOUR-DAY
CEASE-FIRE, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO
BOMBARD GAZA UNTIL THE MOMENT
THAT PAUSE WENT INTO EFFECT AT
MIDNIGHT
LET'S BRING IN NBC'S CLAUDIO
LAVANGA FOR MORE ON ALL THIS
IT TOOK A LOT OF HELP FROM
SEVERAL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE
U.S. AND QATAR TO BROKER THIS
DEAL
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT OVER THE NEXT
COUPLE DAYS?
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING,
JESSICA.
AS YOU MENTIONED, THE DEAL HAS
COME FINALLY INTO EFFECT AT
MIDNIGHT EASTERN, MARKING THE
BEGINNING OF A FOUR-DAY PAUSE IN
THE FIGHTING
NOW WE EXPECT THROUGHOUT THE DAY
TO SEE THE FIRST 13 HOSTAGES WHO
ARE BEING HELD BY HAUMTSMAS IN G
TO BE RELEASED OUT OF A TOTAL OF
50, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE
OF 150 PALESTINIANS WHO ARE
CURRENTLY IN JAIL IN ISRAEL.
WE DO EXPECT MOST OF THEM, IF
NOT ALL OF THEM, TO BE WOMEN AND
CHILDREN
THIS DEAL WAS MEANT TO COME INTO
EFFECT ON THURSDAY, ABOUT 24
HOURS AGO, BUT IT WAS POSTPONED,
EXTENDED FOR THE
ALREADY-NERVE-WRACKING WAIT FOR
FAMILIES IN ISRAEL WAITING TO
HEAR WHETHER THEIR RELATIVES
WERE AMONG THE HOSTAGES ABOUT TO
BE RELEASED, BUT ALSO
PALESTINIANS LIVING IN GAZA WHO
HAD TO ENDURE ANOTHER 24 HOURS,
AN EXTRA DAY OF BOMBING.
WELL, NOW, THE, THEY BOTH SIDES
WILL HOPE THAT THIS PAUSE WILL
GO BEYOND FOUR DAYS, BECAUSE
ISRAEL HAS ALREADY SAID THEY ARE
READY EXTEND THE TRUCE BY ONE
DAY FOR EACH ADDITIONAL TEN
HONKS THAT ARE
HOSTAGES THAT ARE RELEASED
BEYOND THOSE 50 THAT HAVE BEEN
AGREED UPON.
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WEATHER HAMAS
IS READY TO DO THAT YET.
HAMAS DID SAY PART OF THE DEAL
CLOUD
INCLUDED ACCESS TO GAZA BY AID
TRUCKS
THEY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING THE
CONSEQUENCES OF WEEKS OF
BLOCKADE AND RELENTLESS BOMBING
BY ISRAEL.
NOW FINALLY, THIS BREAK THROUGH
WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY WEEKS OF
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
HAMAS BROKERED BY THE U.S.,
QATAR AND EGYPT, BUT IN
PARTICULAR, A LOT OF CREDIT IS
BEING GIVEN TO PRESIDENT BIDEN,
WHO IS BELIEVED TO HAVE
