And meanwhile, Benjamin Netanyahu is
threatening Lebanon, too.
He is indeed.
I mean, this has been an issue since the
beginning, since nine weeks ago when the
October 7th
attack occurred.
The concern that Hezbollah, which like
Hamas, relies on Iran for support and
ideology, that it would jump in in this
battle, in this war, it has not done so
partly, of course, because the United
States has sent two carrier battle
groups there and because the Israelis
and they have been backing back and
forth with Hezbollah and also
Palestinian factions in southern
Lebanon.
But yes, there is Israel is in a fairly
tight spot in which it feels that all
around it there is enormous amount of
hostility and it believes that the way
out of that hostility is to show itself
to be as tough as possible rather than
as conciliatory as possible.
And there we see, of course, a lot of
difficulty with those who would like
them to negotiate now.
Yes.
Speaking of which, the United Nations is
being blamed by Israel for slow aid into
Gaza.
Guitarist warning of disaster.
Just give us the latest on what the two
groups have said.
Yes, I mean, the you know, the Israelis
have sort of been from the beginning,
difficult about bringing in humanitarian
aid into Gaza, concerned that it was
going straight to Hamas in recent days
and weeks, partly under U.S.
pressure, the Israelis have actually
changed their view and said, yes, let's
let a lot in will help.
And then in recent days, they claimed
that the slowness is due to the
inefficiency of the U.N.
And of course, there's an enormous
amount of attention between the U.S.
and Israel, the U.N.
as a body that has repeatedly condemned
Israel for its activities toward the
Palestinians over the decades.
So there's not a lot of love lost there.
And, yes, they're trading accusations.
