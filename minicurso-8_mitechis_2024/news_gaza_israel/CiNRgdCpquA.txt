President Netanyahu is every time
more isolated and begins to react to
United States threats to retire
Your support does not protect civilians in
Gaza at the moment Israel has made two
important ads that ceases two
military controls for the attack on the NGO
by José Andrés and that opens a corridor in
the north to enter the aid
Humanitarian there is no date but it is known
that these ships would reach the port of
Ascot would help the passage of
Erez in the north of the strip we are going
live to Jerusalem Almudena
Ariza what that report says of the attack on
The Central Wall Wall Cooperators
Kitchen yes that report huh acknowledges that
There were serious mistakes in that attack on
convoy in which the
humanitarian workers of that NGO of
Central Kitchen Wall The chef's NGO
José Andrés says that the unit that
The drones operated had seen
A terrorist believed that he was going to a
terrorist with cooperators and
They also thought they were cars of
Never because the report says they were
Toyota cars that do not usually use the
humanitarian workers another error
was that they used thermal cameras with
those who could not see those logos that
Identified on the OS vehicles
There were finally a series of errors in the
chain of command and for those reasons the
Army has said since it will cease
two commanders and that has admonished
several officers but all this has not
convinced to the NGO Wall Central Kitchen
who has already announced that what they want
It is an independent commission that
conduct an investigation because
They assure that they do not trust and that it is not
credible an investigation of your own
Israeli army about their own
Failures
