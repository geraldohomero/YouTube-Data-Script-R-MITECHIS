faisal slid was nine years old when his
village robeso was attacked and captured
by israeli paramilitary groups
it was may 1948 and most of the 400
inhabitants fled after mortar attacks
it was the beginning of the nakba
today sleet believes it's important for
new generations of palestinians to
remember what happened to them on nakba
our children our family are part of the
diaspora they went to lebanon syria and
iraq all over in those countries we were
killed they gave us the title of the
children of the refugees israel has
continued to expand its occupation in
the west bank and jerusalem since 1948.
palestinians say that's make the nakba
the word means catastrophe an ongoing
event
historian adelmann says what's happened
since is in many ways like colonialism
and in some ways it's worse
countries like britain or france or
other colonial countries were occupying
a you know states or countries in asia
and africa and america and so on and
then in the end of the day
in the period of
decolonization they went back to their
country settler colonials they don't
have they don't have the possibility of
going back to their country because they
establish their new society on the
expense of the indigenous people
palestinians say that's exactly how
zionists established israeli state by
displacing them and seizing their land
but israel disagrees
the palestinians have no right of return
because the palestinians started this
conflict and the consequence of this
conflict is among other things the
situation of the refugees but we cannot
and we will not allow people
who for the last 71 years have been
educated to hate the state of israel
into our own country this is
inconceivable but palestinians insist
that it was zionist atrocities that
forced them to flee
the most infamous being their yacin
71 years ago the roughly 600 people here
at the time in their yasin were attacked
by zionist militias more than a hundred
palestinians were killed the massacre
was pivotal in pushing palestinians to
leave their homes
today faisal slate finds little that is
familiar in his village
but he remains hopeful that one day
palestinians will return and rebuild
their homeland and reclaimed what he
says is right for theirs
