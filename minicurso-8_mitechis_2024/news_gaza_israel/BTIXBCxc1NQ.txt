Jews and Arabs do not want
be enemies in front of the Rambam hospital in
Haifa doctors and nurses denounce
those who advocate hatred and
violence between communities
extremists who are, it is
to light the whole country they
will not happen we are friends in a
Israeli society more and more
divided hospitals are islets of
peaceful tolerance and coexistence
that of Rambam is the largest in
north of the country
Here Israeli Arabs represent
more than a third of medical staff said
Elias is one of them he is
internal medical specialist
When I speak to the sick
I do not ask what is their
religion when we come from
Kelvin which village
For me they are all human beings
who should be treated patients
They do not make the difference either
in many other areas it is
true we have problems of
misunderstandings between Jews and Arabs
But in health services
Frankly we don't feel anything of that
Ramdam we also welcome
Palestinians from Gaza or
West Bank
This is the case of Sirois DGI Swat and
his son Mohamed who three times per
week must undergo dialysis
When I go back to the West Bank
ask me how they treat us
These Israelis
I tell them it's just like
With us he even takes care of more
We because it's complicated for us
to arrive so far
The stake of the nations then of the break
The teams meet for a moment
of relaxation
where they all come from have chosen to
favor what brings them together rather
than what divides them
we celebrate the festivals of some and
others we invite ourselves to marriage for
great occasions
We live as a family a family
whose members they are Jews
Muslims or Christians have all
same rights the same duties
as if the blouse they wear
Put all on an equal footing
