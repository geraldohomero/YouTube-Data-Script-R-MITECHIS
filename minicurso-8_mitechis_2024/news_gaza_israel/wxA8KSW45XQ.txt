HOUSE WITHIN A WEEK.
THAT'S HAPPENING NOW ON THE 
HILL.
DANA.
>> Dana: OTHER NEWS, FOX NEWS 
WAS EMOTION BEADED WITH ISRAEL'S
MILITARY IN THE HEART OF GAZA 
STRIP AS TROOPS SEARCHED FOR 
HAMAS WEAPONS INSIDE A TUNNEL 
AND SCHOOL.
ALEX HOGAN IS LIVE WITH MORE 
FROM THE FRONT LINES.
WHAT DID YOU SEE, ALEX?
>> HI, DANA.
AS TENSIONS SPILL OUT ACROSS THE
MIDDLE EAST WE WENT TO THE HEART
OF THE CONFLICT.
WE TRAVELED TO KHAN YOUNIS.
ONE OF THE FOCAL POINTS.
DRIVING INTO GAZA WE'RE EMBEDDED
WITH THE IDFs 55TH BRIGADE.
CONSTANT THREAT OF AMBUSHES FROM
BELOW.
>> THERE IS MORE THAN 5,000 
HOLES AND TUNNELS IN GAZA.
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE FORTIFIED 
TUNNELS USED BY HAMAS, IDF JUST 
BLEW IT UP LAST MONTH.
A QUARTER MILE OF THE BORDER 
FROM ISRAEL.
TROOPS GET WORD AS WE'RE DOWN 
HERE.
>> WOUNDED SOLDIER.
>> ABOUT ANOTHER INJURED 
COMRADE.
DRIVING DEEPER INTO THE STRIP 
GRASS IS REPLACED WITH THE 
REMAINS AND FLATTENED SUBURBS.
WE'RE IN KHAN YOUNIS AND HEAR 
THE ARTILLERY OVERHEAD.
WE'RE TAKEN TO A SCHOOL.
ISRAELI SOLDIERS SAY HAMAS 
STASHED WEAPONS AND DUG A TUNNEL
UNDER THE PLAYGROUND.
>> WE HAD THEM HIDING IN A 
BASEMENT OF THE SCHOOL AND THEY 
STARTED SHOOTING AT US AND THIS 
IS LITERALLY THE STORY OF THIS 
WAR.
>> AS WE WAIT OUTSIDE A MASSIVE 
EXPLOSION SHAKES THE AREA.
SOLDIERS DON'T EVEN FLINCH.
VISIBILITY IS GOING DOWN NOW.
WE CAN FEEL SOME OF THE ASH 
FALLING.
A HEAVY SMELL OF SMOKE.
THERE IS NO FRONT LINE IN THIS 
WAR.
CLOSE RANGE GROUND BATTLES ARE 
VISIBLE IN EVERY DIRECTION.
>> WE'RE WORKING SYSTEMATICALLY 
ONE ZONE AFTER THE OTHER.
DISMANTLING THEIR 
INFRASTRUCTURE.
>> MANY OF THE 2 MILLION PEOPLE 
WHO FLED AND DISPLACED OUT OF 
THEIR HOMES HAVE LEFT PLACES 
LIKE THIS.
THE AREAS OF KHAN YOUNIS WHERE 
IT HAS BEEN LEVELED AS FAR AS 
THE EYE CAN SEE.
IT'S WORTH REMINDING VIEWERS 
THAT JOURNALISTS CANNOT GO INTO 
GAZA WITHOUT EMBEDDING WITH THE 
MILITARY AND THEY REQUESTED TO 
SEE THE STORY TO MAKE SURE THE 
PROPER FACES WERE BLURRED AND
