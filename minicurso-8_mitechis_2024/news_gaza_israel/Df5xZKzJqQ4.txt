AFTER THE WAR.
SOMETHING THAT NETANYAHU SAYS IS
UNAVOIDABLE.
HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS CHAIRMAN 
MICHAEL MCCAUL.
WE BEGIN WITH FOX NEWS WAR 
CORRESPONDENT TREY YENGST IN 
ISRAEL.
TREY.
>> GOOD MORNING.
THE CHALLENGE FOR THE ISRAELI 
MILITARY RIGHT NOW IS THEY HAVE 
GAZA CITY SURROUNDED BUT THERE 
ARE STILL THOUSANDS OF 
PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS AMID THE 
BATTLEFIELD.
THEY HAVE OPENED UP A NEW 
HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR TO GET 
SOME CIVILIANS SOUTHS.
THE MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE 
COLLAPSING DESPITE THE FACT AID 
IN FLOWING TO THE STRIP.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> HOSPITALS IN GAZA LIKE THIS 
ONE ARE OVERFLOWING WITH 
PATIENTS DAMAGED BY AIR STRIKES 
AND LIMITED IN SUPPLIES.
SOME ARE ON THE BRINK OF 
COLLAPSE.
WE'RE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL 
DISASTER.
ALL THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES HAVE 
RUN OUT AND MEDICINE FOR CANCER 
PATIENTS HAS RUN OUT.
THE HOSPITAL'S DIRECTOR EXPLAINS
WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS THE 
CATASTROPHE.
THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS 665 
AID TRUCKS HAVE ENTERED GAZA 
SINCE THE WAR BEGAN OVER A MONTH
AGO.
ON THOSE TRUCKS WAS FOOD, WATER,
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.
WHAT DO THE MANAGERS OF THE 
HOSPITALS SAY THEY NEED?
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO MEDICAL 
FACILITIES SAYING THEY'RE 
RUNNING OUT OF SUPPLIES TO TREAT
WOUNDED PATIENTS?
>> I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALSO IN
A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION 
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAPPED BETWEEN
THIS SITUATION AND HAMAS.
I KNOW THAT HAMAS TOOK OVER ON 
THEIR FUEL SUPPLY.
I KNOW THAT HAMAS RUNS BASICALLY
THE WAY THAT THEY ARE GETTING 
THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES.
>> THE UNITED NATIONS THAT 
COORDINATION WITH ISRAEL AND AID
TO DELIVERIES.
THE AID IS NOT ENOUGH TO SUPPORT
THE MORE THAN 2 MILLION 
PALESTINIANS LIVING THERE.
ISRAELIS POINT TO HAMAS TAKING 
RESOURCES IN THE PAST THAT WERE 
MEANT FOR THE GAZAN PEOPLE AND 
DESPITE THE SITUATION, THERE IS 
NO HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA.
>> WE KNOW AND I CAN SAY FOR 
SURE THERE IS NO HUMANITARIAN 
CRISIS IN GAZA.
>> I WOULD PUSH BACK ON THAT.
YOU WOULD SAY THERE IS NO 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA?
>> I AM SAYING ONCE AGAIN THERE 
IS NO HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN 
GAZA.
I KNOW THE SITUATION IS NOT EASY
BUT WE ARE IN A WAR.
WE DIDN'T PICK -- CHOOSE TO 
ENTER THIS WAR.
>> THERE IS A HUMANITARIAN 
CRISIS INSIDE GAZA.
THE CHALLENGE THOUGH IS THE FACT
THAT THE 2 MILLION PALESTINIAN 
CIVILIANS LIVING THERE ARE RULED
BY HAMAS, A GROUP NOW FIGHTING A
WAR
