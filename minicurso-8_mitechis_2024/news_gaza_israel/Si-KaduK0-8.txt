of course we want to extend a warm
welcome to the family members of the
hostages being held
captive Shani
barf and I always want to be
there for the Jewish
people and for Israel
I
am a big friend of the Jewish people in
Israel and
[Applause]
I it's
um the most common thing that I heard
was that you want to get the message
out you want to share the
message and um I think this is where I
come
in because when you're a
celebrity then you have a certain kind
of a power to communicate to the
mass because you have a lot of cameras
show
up and without really the
media you cannot really communicate with
the
mass and I think this is a story that
everyone in the world needs to
hear and not just
once but as many times as
possible because it shows once
again what hate can do parents anyone
from your family these are our families
where there in captivity by
monsters my dad was
burned his house wasn't I was in his
house there was blood on the walls and
on the floor but the house wasn't burned
the body was I don't know I don't want
to know what they did to him and I'm I'm
holding on to the faith that he died
from being shot he did not suffer the
unimaginable pain of being burned
they're still there and we have nothing
but our voice we can't fight with
nothing but our
voice and before I start talking about
my you were one of my you one of my
father's favorite actors I remember
watching a terminator's movie with him
in the living room and I know that when
he comes back it will put a smile on his
face this is
us okay this is
us
