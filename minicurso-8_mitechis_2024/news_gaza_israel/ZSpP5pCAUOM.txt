Today this feast is being given to Alam Islam
Dupatta from the heads of Mao sisters of Palestine
Being expelled
Hai hai karti raja rabani saheb when
Musharraf came to Palestine
Taker of Julam Ho came to Palestine
Shada's corpse was scattered in Julam Ho Gaja because
There is no rule within Pakistan
Whom we fall
Catch
Today I remember when inside Kashmir
Makbuja was persecuting inside Kashmir
Nawaz Sharif Leader of the
Opposition was arguing in Neela Bhat
He said that I would make India bawar
We are also Pakistan
The leader of the opposition is such an atom bomb
People said trembling in India
What have you talked about, I said
Keep the secret or see Kashmir disappearing
My brother -in -law of Palestine
I am getting you with Pakistan
The atom bomb is not from Pakistan
Utma belongs to the Muslim, it belongs to every Muslim
What says La Ilah Ilallah Muhammad Ras
Is this the matter or not
And ready for jihad where for flourish
Get ready today, the daughter of Gaja, daughter Majloom
Children watching you swear, God's Mufti
To make Mahmud Ku happy
Stand up to freshen up
Tell us the Muslims of the yard
Gaja's
Muslims we become Saladin Ayub by yours
with
Hai Majlum Palestinians
Ho slogan
Takbir slogan
Takbir princely state
Palestine princely state
When I will say, I will not say Tajdar
Nabuwat
So you say
Sallallah Tajdar Khatam Nabuwat
Tajdar Khatam Nabwat
If Muslims are not ready for jihad
Then the district is facing for jihad
Ready
Ho gajwa ready for them
Ho Pakistan
I
