WE BEGIN WITH HEIGHTENED

A PAIR OF BALLISTIC MISSILES.
THE LATEST VOLLEY IN AN EYE FOR 
AN EYE SHOW OF FORCE.
HOURS EARLY, FIGHTER JETS AND 
BOMBERS FROM THE U.S., JAPAN, 
AND SOUTH KOREA TOOK TO THE 
SKIES.
AN ALLIED RESPONSE.

CORRESPONDENT GLEN MCGREGOR NOW

ASIA.

REGION, INTIMIDATING PICTURES OF

NUCLEAR WARHEAD TO MOUNT ON IT.
THE TEST ON SATURDAY CAME DURING
A MEETING OF DEFENCE OFFICIALS

SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS.

SANCTIONS AND TODAY ADDED ITS 
VOICE TO THE CHORUS OF
