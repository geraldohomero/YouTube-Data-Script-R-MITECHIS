What I've seen, not just in the Middle
East, but also in the world and in life,
is that when the forces of good are
winning, the forces of evil will try to
stop them.
And that's really what I believe the
terrorist attack was was meant to do.
I mean, Israel's economy was was rocking
in terms of all the different growth.
It was a very attractive partner to a
lot of people in the region.
The progress between Saudi Arabia and
Israel was was progressing
incredibly well.
And I do think that that poses a big
threat to the forces of evil if you have
the Abraham Accords continuing and
everyone coming together.
That's something that obviously people
will want to stop.
So the attacks were absolutely vicious,
terrible that occurred.
And and that's really what was meant to
be.
So still a lot of possibilities for for
progress and positivity.
But right now, obviously, this is a very
important moment to see what's going to
happen in light of of the attack.
The Abraham Accords are more important
than ever.
Clearly, this is one of the hardest
problem sets that's existed probably in
geopolitics.
But the end state has to look something
like this and it has to have two
elements.
Number one, Israel has to have the
security to not be threatened by its
neighbors and to be able to protect its
citizens.
That is absolutely crucial, has is
non-negotiable.
And I do think a lot of the world agrees
that that's something that should exist.
The second element is that the
Palestinian people have to have the
opportunity to live a better life.
And I think that if you go through the
element, it's not just saying let's
create a state.
It has to be a state that can function
and thrive, because if you don't create
that, then the people will again find
ways to blame other people instead of
the leadership that's putting it there.
