our Act was meant to make a connection
between uh our hostages and the work
that we do throughout the year the sun
is a very very important symbol in the
environmental movement the sun
symbolizes hope and it also symbolizes
uh change it symbolizes the future that
we see and so our message today is bring
our Sunshine back the people held by
Hamas are our Sunshine they're the
sunshine to the many many hostage
families sitting here today and that's
our message to the world we want to
bring our Sunshine back every single one
of them is a ray of sunshine to all of
us and to someone very special to
[Music]
them
[Music]
this is also our answer to the
international en uh environmental
movement because this is our answer to
Greta this is our answer we came here to
say no climate Justice without our
hostages coming back we'll talk about
everything later but the first and very
clear thing important to us is to
embrace the families and to just tell
them we want everybody home now we won't
stop until they're all home
[Music]
now
[Music]
it's amazing to me
because all those organizations and
people who try to fight for better
future this is the people I want to
fight for me like this is the people I
need right now most of all because this
is my people this is my
[Music]
[Music]
generation I think it's right we need to
bring our Sunshine home and I think more
than that I I want to bring them the
sunshine because they don't have any
right now they they physically don't
have sunshine

kidnapped to Gaza and we are here
waiting for her trying to do whatever we
can to press the the the government the
cabinet all all state around us to help
us to bring them home
[Music]
back it is important for me
personally but also you know because
Greta how do you
say called H to free Palestine and
H it took a a side and not not the
Israeli side it was very disappointing
for many many people in the Israeli
climate movement and I think that now uh
standing for the kidnapper families and
here in the Square it's very
[Music]
important oh
