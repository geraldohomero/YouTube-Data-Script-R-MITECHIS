Almost five months into Israel's military 
campaign in Gaza, and those starving in  
the north of the bombarded enclave say they 
are having to be creative in order to eat.
Marwan al-Awadeya and his family 
are one such family. They have  
taken to eating the leaves of prickly 
pear cactuses to ward off hunger.
While the fruit of prickly pear cactuses 
are commonly eaten around the Mediterranean,  
the thick leaves are only ever consumed 
by animals, mashed up in their feed.
“Today, we can (still) find cactus. In a week,  
the cactus will no longer be available, and 
we will live on nothing. We will die. I,  
in approximately one month - and I have a photo 
- have lost some 30 kilograms this month. One  
month. I have lost 30 kilograms. Why? Because 
there is no food. This is our food now in the  
northern Gaza Strip. There is nothing else. 
Everything is gone. There is nothing left.”
A crane lifts equipment from the ruins 
of Kamel Ajour's smashed out bakery.
The destruction here underscores one 
reason starving people are reduced  
to eating raw cactus leaves in the enclave.
Ajour's business is not alone, most 
bakeries in the area lie in rubble.
Bread will be critical to any sustained 
effort to relieve Palestinian hunger.
One in six children in northern 
Gaza is wasting from malnutrition.
People have had to bake bread themselves as best  
they can over fires made with wood 
salvaged from ruined buildings.
They make bread from animal feed and birdseed. 
Most say they can only eat once a day at most.
Aid is flowing into southern 
parts of the Gaza Strip,  
though too slowly to avert 
a hunger crisis even there.
And it barely makes it to northern 
areas that are further from the main  
border crossing and only accessible 
through more active battle fronts.
Israel has said the failure to get enough aid into  
Gaza to meet humanitarian needs is 
due to UN distribution failures.
