Everyone is waiting for the hostages here
finally released in Israel
It should actually be tomorrow
Friday in the early morning hours
pass and the whole
Hospitals in Israel are on the
Release of the hostages
Of course you hope that prepares that
The hostages are unharmed first
So I was told in
Hospitals brought and I have
Now a lady there her mother on 7
October kidnapped by Hamas
it was 84 years old
old what is currently going on in your head
I'm afraid I'm big to myself
I am afraid that this one
Deal because he doesn't already start today
Is it for me
Terrible 8 days since October 7th
have passed now and we are waiting and
Wait why do you think this
Agreement at the beginning you have yes
Said today, the hostages would
Released now that has been on
moved tomorrow why she thinks is
it didn't come about today
I don't know but I think there have to
they ask NetaNahu and others
Benjamin Netan is involved
In the opinion of someone who does everything for
The spirituals what se is or
he does more for the war I think
that he is more of the war
And not for that
Hostages what do people say about it
See the his
Activities me
I don't speak for the others
Now only talk about what I am
think it's easy
Disappointing her mother is 84 years old
Old we heard that
the
that children are also released
should and young people and just old
People but you don't know whether
Your mother will be underneath no that
I don't just know Hamas who knows who
on the list
Stand where her mother was caught
Taken she was in heroma in the kibut
Heros have been kidnapped since
heard something or in the last
Weeks of your mother a video
You saw them somewhere from video
Discover we saw a video that day
When she kiped, nothing has been
more no more
Signs now what do you wish
Now for your family I wish
that they
comes back very soon and that you
healthy
is and what do you wish for politics how
I don't want to say that I want
not about that
