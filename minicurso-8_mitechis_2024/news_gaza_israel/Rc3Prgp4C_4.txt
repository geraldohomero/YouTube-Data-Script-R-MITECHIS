It seems as if so far Israel is keeping
its options on the table and still
deciding exactly what it's going to do
to react to Saturday night's drone and
missile barrage against its territory.
And obviously, this was a major and
unprecedented attack from on.
It didn't cause much damage.
There was only one casualty, a ten year
old girl and light damage to to an
airfield.
But nonetheless, this was a huge attack
that required the assistance of not just
the Israeli Air Force, but the UK, US,
French and other air forces
in order to to foil it.
And the US, the Europeans and Arab
states are all trying to urge restraint
on the part of Israel.
The last thing they want to see is this
conflict in the Middle East escalating
and getting more serious than it already
is.
As we heard there from Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, he's not ruling out
anything.
He isn't being extremely gung ho in
saying that Israel will react
aggressively to what happened on on
Saturday night.
But as I said, that's still possible.
Israel may bide its time.
There's no indication that it's going to
react immediately.
And this is it could do this over the
coming weeks.
I think for the sake of its own public,
it has to do something.
There's a lot of Israeli ministers and
analysts saying that it would be a it
would be a very weak showing and a
dangerous showing for the country if it
didn't react in some way to Iran.
Iran's actions on Saturday, it doesn't
that doesn't necessarily mean it has to
strike Iranian soil in a sort of tit for
tat response.
It could go after Iran's proxies a bit
harder than it already is the likes of
Hezbollah in Lebanon and groups in
Syria.
And it could target some Iranian assets
around the world without doing something
as high profile as what the Iranian did
on Saturday.
But I think everyone is now watching
Israel, and that is its reaction is the
big question for global financial
markets this week.
