>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
HELMUT OBERLANDER IS DEAD.
IN A STATEMENT HIS FAMILY SAID
THE 97-YEAR-OLD DIED PEACEFULLY
IN HIS HOME SURROUNDED BY LOVED
ONES.
THE WATERLOO RESIDENT WAS IN THE
MIDST OF A DECADES LONG
DEPORTATION BATTLE WITH THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
CTV'S DARYL MORRIS HAS MORE ON
THIS JOINING US NOW.
DARYL COUNTRY'S CANADIAN
CITIZENSHIP WAS REVOKED PROPER
TIMES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT?
>> Daryl: THE LAST TIME WAS
JUNE 2017, RICARDO AND AS
RECENTLY AS THIS MONTH HIS OR
LAWYERS WERE ONCE AGAIN ARGUING
ON HIS BEHALF ASKING FOR AN
ADJOURNMENT AND HIS DEPORTATION
HEARING.
THE HEARING WAS SET TO GO AHEAD
IN FEBRUARY TO DETERMINE IF HE
SHOULD BE DEPORTED BACK TO
GERMANY.
>> Reporter: BORN IN THE
UKRAINE IN 1924 AND LATER MOVING
TO GERMANY, OBERLANDER SAYS HE
WAS CONSCRIPTED INTO DUTY AS A
TEENAGER.
HE SERVED FROM 1941 UNTIL 1943
AS AN INTERPRETER FOR A NAZI
SQUAD WHICH WAS PART OF A FORCED
RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING MORE
THAN 2 MILLION PEOPLE, MOST OF
THEM CHOOSE DURING THE SECOND
WORLD WAR.
HE SAID HE WAS CONSCRIPTED ON
THE THREAT OF DEATH AND HE NEVER
PARTICIPATED IN ANY KILLING.
HE CAME TO CANADA AND 1954 AND
BECAME A CITIZEN YEARS LATER BUT
DID NOT DISCLOSE HIS WARTIME
EXPANSE.
HIS CITIZENSHIP WAS FIRST
REVOKED IN THE 1990s AND THEN
REINSTATED AND REVOKED THREE
MORE TIMES.
THE LAST TIME WAS JUNE 2017.
HELMUT OBERLANDER APPEALED AND
LOST.
THE DIRECTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF WATERLOO CENTRE FOR GERMAN
STUDY SAYS HIS DEATH MEANS THE
LEGAL CASE ESSENTIALLY DIES WITH
HIM.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT A
TRIAL IN GERMANY IS THAT IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THE
FACTS BEYOND ANY KIND OF DOUBT
OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO WHATEVER
MATERIAL AVAILABLE IN ARCHIVES
AND OTHER RECORDS.
THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN A
TRIAL AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE HAD
PERHAPS THE CLEAREST
UNDERSTANDING OF JUST WHAT
HAPPENED.
THAT WON'T HAPPEN NOW.
>> Reporter: HE SAYS THIS MAY
BE A CASE SCHOLARS WANT TO
CONTINUE TO STUDY.
>>> JAMES SKIDMORE ALSO SAYS THE
LENGTHY LEGAL TRIALS IMPACTED
THE GERMAN CANADIAN COMMUNITY
ESPECIALLY HERE IN
KITCHENER-WATERLOO.
HIS STUDIES FOCUS ON HOW THEY
FELT UNDER ATTACK AS A RESULT.
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT
TONIGHT AT FIVE AND 6:00.
