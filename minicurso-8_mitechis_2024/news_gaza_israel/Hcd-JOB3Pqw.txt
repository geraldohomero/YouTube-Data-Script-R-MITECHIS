>> Bill: WE'LL HAVE TO THINK OF 
THE NEXT BIG IDEA COMING UP.
MEANWHILE, WANT TO GET TO THE 
MIDDLE EAST.
BREAKING NEWS OVERNIGHT.
FOLKS JUST WAKING UP TODAY.
THE CEASE-FIRE IS OVER BETWEEN 
ISRAEL AND HAMAS.
IDF RESUMED BOMBING OF TARGETS 
BLAMING HAMAS SAYING THEY BROKE 
THE CEASE-FIRE BEFORE IT WAS SET
TO EXPIRE.
NATE FOYE LIVE ON THE GROUND AT 
HIS POST IN NORTHERN ISRAEL WITH
THE LATEST ON THE HEADLINES.
THEY'RE BACK AT IT.
HELLO.
>> THEY CERTAINLY ARE, BILL.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE BROKE DOWN 
IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS TODAY
AFTER ISRAEL SAYS HAMAS REFUSED 
TO RELEASE THE 20 FINAL FEMALE 
HOSTAGES THAT IT STILL HAS IN 
GAZA.
THIS IS WHAT WE SAW SHORTLY 
AFTER THAT.
TAKE A LOOK.
YOU MENTIONED IT, BILL.
ISRAELI JETS HIT MULTIPLE 
TARGETS IN GAZA INCLUDING -- 
ISRAEL HAS HIT 200 TERRORIST 
TARGETS IN GAZA TODAY.
HAMAS SAYS ISRAEL VIOLATED IT 
FIRST AND ISRAEL SAID -- 
>> THEY HAVE DECIDED TO HOLD 
ONTO THE HOSTAGES THEY ABDUCTED 
IN VIOLATION OF HUMANITARIAN 
LAW.
HAMAS WILL NOW TAKE THE MOTHER 
OF ALL THUMPINGS.
>> SO YOU SEE THE DAMAGE HERE.
THE IDF DROPPED LEAFLETS INTO 
THE SOUTHERN GAZA STRIP 
INSTRUCTING CIVILIANS TO MOVE TO
EVACUATION ZONES.
MANY DIDN'T AND THE DAMAGE IS 
SEVERE.
THE END OF THIS TEMPORARY 
CEASE-FIRE MEANS HORRIBLE 
CONDITIONS WILL GET WORSE FOR 
THE PALESTINIANS IN GAZA.
BADLY NEEDED AID WILL HAVE AN 
EVEN HARDER TIME GETTING IN.
QATAR'S MINISTRY OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS SAY NEGOTIATIONS WILL 
CONTINUE TO RESUME A PAUSE IN 
FIRING.
THE END OF THE CEASE-FIRE 
AGREEMENT MEANS ISRAELI HOSTAGES
WON'T BE COMING HOME TODAY.
HAMAS RELEASED EIGHT ISRAELIS IN
AN EXCHANGE YESTERDAY.
OVER 130 HOSTAGES REMAIN IN 
GAZA.
NOW THAT CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT, 
BILL, NEVER TECHNICALLY APPLIED 
TO THE HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS THAT
ARE ON THE NORTHERN FRONT IN 
LEBANON BUT THE PAST FEW DAYS 
HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY QUIET.
SO NOW THAT THE FIGHTING HAS 
RESUMED IN THE SOUTH, THE FEW 
PEOPLE WHO REMAIN IN THE 
EVACUATED VILLAGES UP NORTH WAIT
TO SEE IF FIGHTING WILL COME 
HERE.
>> Bill: A BIT LATER WE'LL TALK 
TO THE PARENTS OF AN ISRAELI 
AMERICAN WHO HAS
