>> Reporter: THIS MORNING  WE 
HEARD FROM THE PAKISTAN FOREIGN 
MINISTRY WHO CONFIRMED PAKISTAN 
HAD HIT TERRORIST HIDEOUTS 
INSIDE AN AREA OF IRAN.  
THEY USED SIMILAR THING WHICH 
TO THE LANGUAGE USED YESTERDAY 
BY THE IRAN  FOREIGN MINISTER

PAKISTAN BORDERS. 
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
MILITANT GROUPS RATHER THAN THE 
STATE THAT THEY ARE HEADING IN 
PAKISTAN REFERRED TO IRAN AS 
BEING A BROTHERLY COUNTRY  AND 
THIS RELATIONSHIP IS CERTAINLY 
UNDER TENSION AT THE MOMENT.

CONDEMNED  THIS PARTICULAR 
ATTACK THAT HAPPENED INSIDE ITS 
BORDERS.
