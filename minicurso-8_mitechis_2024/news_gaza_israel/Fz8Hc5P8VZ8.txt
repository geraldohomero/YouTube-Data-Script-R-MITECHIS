exporting weapons so that clear continues
Redundancy is worth arming in this
War in front of the terrorist group ever

when referring to the requests of
opposition parties to be
suspend the sale of weapons to Israel
Sunac said the United Kingdom has a
process established for a long time
time on the export regime
of arms and added that there is no
change in this regard good really

our
Allies
