I want to make clear we not looking for
a confrontation in our northern border
or with uh anyone else we have focused
on destroying Hamas infrastructure and
bringing our citizens back home but if
his Bala will drag us into war it is
should it should be clear that Lebanon
will pay the price Lebanon cannot be a a
sovereign member of the International
Community its citizens carrying a
Lebanese passport but when it comes to
attacking Israel they're not responsible
like you we are extremely worried and
Disturbed as to the immense rise of
anti-Semitism around the world also in
your country we um care for our brothers
and sisters of Jewish communities all
over the world for their well-being and
safety and I think the International
Community must take strong actions to
protect the H the Jewish citizens all
over the world thank you for coming to
is and sharing your support with us the
first objective we should have today is
the release of all the stages without
any
distinction because this is an awful
crime to play with his
lives of children adults all people
civilians and soldiers I want you to be
sure that you are not left alone in this
war against
terrorism
because I speak here on behalf of a
country which experien these terrorist
attacks
unhappily and you were there at the
time and I think this is our duty to
fight against these terrorist
groups without any confusion
without I would say enlarging this
conflict what
happened will never be forgotten for
sure thank you and we will be here today
tomorrow and the day
after for peace and stability because
these people were killed just be just
because they were Jewish and they wanted
to live in peace
mhm thank
you
