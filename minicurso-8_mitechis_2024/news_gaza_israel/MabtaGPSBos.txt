The end of Hamas in Gaz has now come very poor
And Hamas's fighters to save their lives
Gaza is hiding in four hospitals
IDF has now started attacks continuously
But their aim is to stay in hospitals
Avoiding IDF attacks and in such a situation
Patients are shielding but Hamas
Israel is currently on the insistence of ending
Ready to retreat
No
Left about 10 kilometers and 41 km long
Khaja City
Hamas's fighters now after bombing
Removed in places
The first place to hide the fighters of Hamas
Al shifa
Hospital Hamas's fighters to hide
El Rati S in another place
Hospital Hamas's third shelter of fighters
Of indonesian
Hospital and fourth place is Nasir Hospital
Israeli's Tor Tor Air Strike and Northern
From the ground operation of IDF in Gaz
Israeli army chases Hamas's fighters
Karr to make in these four hospitals
These four have been forced to fight Hamas
Thousands of innocent people should be shielded in hospitals
They are sitting hoping that
Israeli army hospitals are not attacked
Will do it but this time not this time of Hamas
Fighters get lost in the sky or in the ground
Go hide or referg to hospitals
Go to camps this time in gaz
No place where their life is safe
Because Israel has made it clear that he
Will consider only by destroying Hamas from Gaz
That is why the Israeli army has given these four
Hospitals have surrounded all sides
[music]
Thousands of IDF soldiers hundreds
Of these four hospitals with tanks
A circle in 100 meters radius around
That is, now Parinda also these hospitals
These four cannot go out of
Thousands of injured are treated in hospitals
Who is Israel to hospital immediately
Al Rati has heard the decree to leave
And patients admitted to Nasir Hospital
Examination to leave Israel to hospital
Asked but the mood to give Israel deferment
I do not have to enter hospitals
The ready standing IDF has clearly stated that
The one who does not leave the hospital will not leave his death
Will be responsible itself because Israel this time
No such shield between yourself and Hamas
Want to come to the end of Hamas
Left out
Take
We
