BEFORE THAT, LET'S GET TO OUR
CHIEF CORRESPONDENT FOR THE
LATEST IN TEL AVIV.
RICHARD?
REMAKE THE TRUCE BETWEEN HAMAS
AND ISRAEL IS ENTERING A
DIFFICULT PHASE.
IT COULD BE BREAKING DOWN.
THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPECTATION,
LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING
THAT THERE WOULD BE AN
EXTENSION, POTENTIALLY A TWO
DAY EXTENSION.
IN THE 11th HOUR, ISRAEL AND
HAMAS AGREED TO A ONE DAY
EXTENSION.
TODAY IS THE LAST DAY OF THE
TRUCE BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.
ANOTHER HOSTAGE RELEASE IS
EXPECTED TO COME TODAY.
IT ALMOST BROKE DOWN OVERNIGHT.
HAMAS PUT FORWARD A LIST SAYING
THEY WOULD RELEASE SEVEN
HOSTAGES AND HAD OVER THE BODIES
OF THREE OF THE HOSTAGES THAT
WERE KILLED BY ISRAELI
AIRSTRIKES.
ISRAEL REJECTED THAT.
NOW, WHEN HE TALKED TO ISRAELI
OFFICIALS AND YOU SPEAK TO HAMAS
, THEY'RE TELLING PEOPLE TO BE
READY FOR THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN
TO BEGIN, IT FEELS LIKE TENSION
IS RESUMING AND WE COULD BE
GOING INTO A MILITARY PHASE OF
THE CONFLICT WHERE ISRAEL
RENEWS ITS CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE
GAZA STRIP TO DESTROY AT
DISLODGE HAMAS FROM POWER.
THERE WILL BECAUSE IF ISRAEL
DOES RESUME ITS CAMPAIGNCAUSE
FOR GAZA, OBVIOUSLY, WHERE THE
HEALTH MINISTRY, SAYS AROUND
15,000 PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY BEEN
15,000 PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY BEEN
KILLED. AND THE COST FOR ISRAEL.
ISRAEL HAS FACED AN
INTERNATIONAL BACKLASH DUE TO
ITS MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST
GAZA AND ALL OF THE CIVILIANS
HAVE BEEN KILLED, AND A
BACKLASH WITHIN THE COUNTRY.
IT BEGINS A MILITARY CAMPAIGN,
AND IT COULD SLOW DOWN OR STOP
THE HOSTAGE EXCHANGE PROGRAM,
THE HOSTAGES AND BEING RELEASED
FOR PALESTINIAN PRISONERS.
ISRAEL WANTS TO KEEP PRESSURE
ON HAMAS.
THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE
PACE OF THE RELEASE SO FAR.
THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE
ANSWERS ABOUT HOW MANY HOSTAGES
IT HAS, HOW MANY ARE ALIVE, AND
HOW MANY ARE IN THEIR CUSTODY.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN IS
HERE  TRYING TO ENCOURAGE
DIALOGUE AND EXTEND THE TRUCE,
TRYING TO CONVINCE ISRAEL THAT
IF IT DOES RESUME MILITARY
