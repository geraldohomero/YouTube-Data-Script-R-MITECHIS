>> THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH
BOMBING THAT THE WATER SYSTEM
IS NOT FUNCTIONAL.
THANK YOU.
>>> UNITED STATES IS EXPANDING
ITS FOOTPRINT NEAR ISRAEL.
THE PENTAGON HAS DEPLOYED THE
USS DWIGHT D EISENHOWER STRIKE
GROUP TO THE MEDITERRANEAN.
IT JOINS THE GERALD R FORD
CARRIER THAT ENTERED THE REGION
LAST WEEK.
OUR CORRESPONDENT IS FOLLOWING
THAT FOR US.
U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY SAYS THE
WARSHIPS ARE NOT INTENDED TO
JOIN IN ON THE FIGHTING OR TAKE
PART IN THE OPERATIONS, SO WHY
SEND THEM?
>> IT IS ABOUT DETERRENCE.
THIS IS A BIG SHOW OF PRESENCE
AND SUPPORT AND STRENGTH.
THE IDEA IS THEY ARE SHOWING
SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AND THEIR
FIGHT AGAINST HAMAS, THEY ARE
ALSO HOPING THAT BY SENDING
THIS MASSIVE MILITARY PRESENCE
FORWARD A CARRIER STRIKE AND
ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY, A
FIGHTER AIRCRAFT ON LAND ALL ON
ISRAEL THE HOPE IS THAT THE
U.S. IS SHOWING THAT THEY WILL
WILLINGLY SEND FORWARD SO MUCH
MILITARY POWER INTO THE AREA
THAT IT WOULD DETER ANYONE WHO
MIGHT BE SUPPORTING HAMAS IN
THE DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS
AHEAD.
THAT COULD INCLUDE GROUPS LIKE
HEZBOLLAH.
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT FROM MATT
BRADLEY WHO IS THERE.
IT COULD INCLUDE GROUPS LIKE,
IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AND IT ALSO
INCLUDES IRAN.
THE GOAL IS TO CONTAIN THIS
CONFLICT AND KEEP IT FROM
SPREADING INTO A REGIONAL
CONFLICT.
>> TELL US MORE ABOUT THE
EISENHOWER STRIKE GROUP AND
WHAT RESOURCES ARE BEING SENT
OVER.
>> THE EISENHOWER STRIKE GROUP,
TO ANY CIVILIAN IT IS SIMILAR
TO THE CAPABILITIES THAT THE
FORD IS BRINGING.
IT IS ANOTHER CARRIER, IT IS
NOT JUST SHIPS AND THOUSANDS OF
SAILORS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT,
IT IS ALSO THE AIRPLANES AND
THE AIRCRAFT.
THEY HAVE SURVEILLANCE,
HELICOPTERS, FIGHTER AIRCRAFT
ON BOARD AND IN ADDITION IF
NECESSARY THEY HAVE LONG-RANGE
STRIKE CAPABILITY.
THAT IS THE MISSILES THAT SOME
OF THE SHIPS CAN FIRE.
THEY ARE TARGETED, THERE ARE
GUIDED MISSILES.
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO STRIKE
OUT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ON
LAND IF NECESSARY.
I HAVE TO SAY ALL OF THESE ARE
CAPABILITIES THAT NO ONE IS
TALKING ABOUT U.S. USING, BUT
IT GOES TOWARDS THE IDEA OF
DETERRING ANYONE WHO MIGHT WANT
