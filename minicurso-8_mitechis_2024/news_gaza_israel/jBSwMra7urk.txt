a measure of justice isn't the same
as equal justice this verdict
brings us a step closer and the fact is
we still have work to do we still
must reform the system last summer
together with senator cory booker and
representative karen bass
i introduced the george floyd justice
and policing act
this bill would hold law enforcement
accountable
and help build trust between law
enforcement
and our communities this bill is part
of george floyd's legacy
the president and i will continue to
urge the senate
to pass this legislation not as a
panacea
for every problem but as a start
this work is long overdue
america has a long history of systemic
racism
black americans and black men in
particular have been treated
throughout the course of our history as
less than human
black men are fathers
and brothers and sons
and uncles and grandfathers
and friends and neighbors
their lives must be valued
in our education system in our health
care system
in our housing system in our economic
system
in our criminal justice system in
our nation full stop
because of smartphones so many americans
have now seen
the racial injustice that black
americans have known for generations
the racial injustice that we have fought
for generations that my parents
protested
in the 1960s that millions of us
americans of every race protested last
summer
here's the truth about racial injustice
it is not just a black america problem
or a people of color problem
it is a problem for every american
it is keeping us from fulfilling the
promise
of liberty and justice for all
and it is holding our nation back from
realizing
our full potential
we are all a part of george
floyd's legacy and our job now
is to honor it and to honor
him thank you
