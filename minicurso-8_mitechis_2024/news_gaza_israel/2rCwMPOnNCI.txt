This is clearly not to
Virginie hars hello appeasement
Difficult to know how it's okay
evolve in the coming hours but
Here we have reached a level of violence
never seen since 2014
Yes absolutely unheard of since 2014
at the time you may remember the
conflict had lasted almost two months
with an unprecedented assessment since the
war of the six days of 1967 there was
had 220 miles of forgiveness 2200
killed Palestinians including 1,500 civilians and
many children
Israeli side 73 people who had
been killed including 67 soldiers then we
is not there yet
in terms of human assessment but
Indeed we are clearly in a
first phase of climbing and
climbing to war with
bombings on one side of the strikes
air rockets
rockets and a human assessment already quite
important and especially on both sides of
people and leaders who are
determined to continue who say ready
to resist or continued that to
rush into this logic the
problem of this escalation is that
It is a risk of conflagration
perhaps regional geography
So we know that countries in the countries
Arabs until now have responded to
Finally we
We were quite moderate in their
approaches but their populations can
They show a bit of inclinations
more a little harder we also know that the
TÃ¼rkiye and Iran have called
Muslim populations to lend themselves
solidarity or Palestinians and what
is clear it is also that this question
Palestian returns to the center of
the attention of the community
international
The other risk is also a risk
dressed inside
of Israel with even a risk of war
civil in any case it was the words of
Mrs of the mayor of Lot a lot so a city
called be mixed or with a
population to the Jewish and Arabic faith of
the other and which has experienced scenes from
very very important violence these
last times and we leave
