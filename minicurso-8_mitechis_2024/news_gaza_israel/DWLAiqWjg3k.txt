in israel a controversial new rule has
been making headlines
if you fall in love with the palestinian
from west bank
you will have to tell the israeli
government all foreigners must declare
their love interest to the defense
ministry but that's not all if they
marry they will be required to leave
after 27 months
this will be for a cooling off period of
at least half a year
foreign passport holders will have 30
days to declare their romantic
relationship they will also have to
declare if they have or will inherit
land
this was part of israel's new strategy
to tighten rules on foreigners living in
west bank and after the massive backlash
israel has delayed the implementation of
the new rules it has removed the 30-day
rule to declare your love interest
but the other rules remain valid
rules regulating the entry of foreign
academics and students are also included
the new rules will also make it more
difficult for palestinians with foreign
passports to travel to west bank they
will have to apply for a visa 45 days in
advance
they may not be able to fly into tel
aviv's airport as well
there is already an israeli ban on
granting residency status to foreign
spouses of palestinians this means
thousands continue to live with an
uncertain legal status
ironically these rules are not
applicable for jewish settlers living
here west bank was occupied by israel in
the 1967 war but out of the three
million people living out here many are
jewish israeli citizens the israelis
living out here are called settlers
they live in the west bank but are
citizens of israel
these settlements enjoy widespread
backing among israelis many of whom view
them as a religious national or
strategic necessity
israel cites historical and biblical
links to the region many jews took it
to look at it as an integral part of the
biblical land of israel over 460 000
israeli settlers reside in the occupied
west bank there are around 130
officially recognized settlements
and israel says these settlements were
built on weakened or unused land
but palestinians claim the land is often
bought from them using middlemen
most countries view these settlements as
illegal an obstacle to peace and the
two-state solution
