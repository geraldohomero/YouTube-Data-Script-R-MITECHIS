this case of Iran and where the
Iran's response we saw too
during yesterday and that we are going to
analyze shortly also in the
Interviews on the proposal of a
veto to the Arab oil to
Israel that launched the price of oil
fast up the United States as
hos coming counting a few minutes ago
Fast out to say Venezuela
We raise a part of the sanctions
Take 300,000 barrels of oil
market daily we reduce the price and
especially you compensate for what is going
Seeing that it is a shock above all
energy at this time with crude
With oil as fundamental
What is the key to this proposal for
Iran who answers Saudi Arabia depends on
How Saudi Arabia is positioned in this
environment that is among the 51 countries that
they take the measure there in that environment
can calibrate if Iran is alone or
Saudi Arabia that was more attached to
United States in recent decades and
that a part of its population said
that you are doing or takes advantage of the
situation and just as he has broken
Diplomatic relations with Israel
Pousado says again to Iran and
support the measure against Israel to
also local public opinion have it
happy around that they are not in the
United States environment supporting
Israel against
Palestine so the key
fundamental is not the proposal of veto
that will go Mass the key
fundamental is in how many of the 51
support and within 51 one Arabia
Saudi what has proposed or what is
raising in this case Iran is seeing
To what extent Saudi Arabia can turn
A little diplomacy can change your
position of the last years of a
little more than the last decade and can
walk towards a more pro
Arabic against Israel and in favor of a
oil or PEP market that walks more
to 1970 Yon Kipur Syria and Egypt that is to say
In that environment what is calibrating
Iran is where is Saudi Arabia if
Saudi Arabia moves towards Iran the
oil price has a problem
The United States has a problem and all
That photograph is moving around
How the relationship can be improving
between Iran and Saudi Arabia that had
Broken the other fundamental point
