I'm in uh in a hospital in ashala Bara
Medical Center it's called barela
Medical Center and this is the place
where uh one of the Rockets hit on
Saturday on uh 7th of October uh you can
see behind me is the uh you know room of
the head of the Department of the
Pediatric Center so this is the
Pediatric Center and the rocket came and
hit in this particular spot the doctor
was sitting somewhere here and he he
basically heard the alarm and then ran
through this part and
went this is the shelter that he went
there and uh the rocket fit right here
and it was this this is the uh you know
you can see the debris of the glass
shards and what has happened in
you can see those colorful sort of you
know art because it's a child care
center so uh that's where we are in in
ashala which is very close to Gaza and
uh it's uh it's one of the uh places
which was uh which was sort of affected
because of the attacks on 7th of
October
I have with me Dr umri lowski who is the
head of the uh Orthopedics Department
at the velai hospital in eshon eshon is
very close to Gaza which was hit by the
rocket attacks by Hamas on 7th of
October uh doctor can you tell us what
happened that day what have we seeing
right now here so what we are seeing now
is the home of head of pediatric develop
you can see here
his his is
completely over you can look at his
books medical
books
there that fell just on the roof of this
this he was lucky enough to run away to
the shelter close enough
down down here so his life was sa
because of the run fast enough to to the
sh so how much time does it usually take
when the siren comes and the offs to hit
what is the time we have like 10 to 15
seconds maybe 30 seconds and between the
siren gums sometimes uh sometimes it's
less and then we have to find a place
where where it would be safe those are
all buildings of the hospital so they
are completely unsafe the new buildings
is a big
thank you so much thank
