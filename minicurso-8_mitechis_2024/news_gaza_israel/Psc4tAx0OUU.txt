"CTV NATIONAL NEWS" WITH LISA
LAFLAMME.
>> WE BEGIN WITH THE VIEW FROM
THE GROUND OF A COUNTRY CANADIAN
SOLDIERS DIED TO PROTECT, NOW
SINKING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO
DESPERATION, AND CHAOS.
EXACTLY FIVE MONTHS AGO TONIGHT,
THIS IS WHAT THE KABUL AIRPORT
LOOKED LIKE, FRANTIC CROWDS
RACING TO REACH THE ONLY ESCAPE
ROUTE AVAILABLE FROM THE TALIBAN
TAKEOVER.
NOW IN THESE FEW MONTH, ALMOST
THE ENTIRE POPULATION, 97% ARE
FACING POVERTY IN THE YEAR
AHEAD.
CTV'S PAUL WORKMAN IS IN KABUL
TONIGHT, PAUL, CHANGE HAS COME
SO FAST.
WHAT'S IT LIKE IN THAT CITY
RIGHT NOW.
>> Reporter: AS WE KNOW,
AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN RADICALLY
RECONFIGURED BY THE TALIBAN, AND
THE PARADOX IS IMMEDIATELY
OBVIOUS.
>> IN A CITY THAT WAS TURNED
INTO A FORTRESS, TO DEFEND
ITSELF AGAINST THE TALIBAN,
CONSIDER THIS IT IS NOW THOSE
SAME TALIBAN FIGHTERS WHO ARE
THE NEW GUARDIANS OF KABUL
SECURITY.
INDEED OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY.
>> THERE IS CURRENTLY NO
SECURITY PROBLEM, SAYS A LOCAL
COMMANDER.
EVERYONE CAN SEE, INCLUDING YOU,
HE SAYS, IT'S NEVER BEEN SAFER
TO TRAVEL.
BECAUSE PERHAPS, THE TALIBAN ARE
NO LONGER SENDING OUT SUICIDE
BOMBERS TO KILL PEOPLE.

WITH ITS ABUNDANCE OF FRUIT,
VEGETABLES AND MEAT.
IN A COUNTRY WHERE MILLIONS ARE
CLOSE TO STARVATION.
THE PROBLEM ISN'T A LACK OF
FOOD, IT'S A LACK OF PAYING 
JOBS.
WHEN PEOPLE WERE WORKING, THEY
WERE BUYING FRUIT, HE SAYS.
UNTIL THE TALIBAN ARRIVES, AND
THE ECONOMY COLLAPSED.
KIDS EXCAVATE ADVANTAGE FOR
BOTTLES THEY CAN SELL.
SA FORMER SECURITY GUARD
CLUTCHING HIS CV AND FEELING
DEFEATED.
THERE'S FOOD HE SAYS BUT WHEN
YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, HOW CAN
YOU BUY RICE OR VEGETABLES.
FROM ABUNDANCE TO THE GRIMACED
END OF THE FOOD CHAIN, BABIES
SUFFERING FROM ACUTE
MALNUTRITION.
THIS LITTLE BOY IS TWO, WITH
MOTTLED BROWN SKIN AND A FATHER
WHO IS A DRUG ADDICT.
SOMETIMES, HE WOULD COME HOME
WITH FOOD, SAYS THE CHILD'S
MOTHER, BUT OTHERWISE, THERE WAS
NOTHING.
THEY FEEL LIKE MY OWN CHILDREN,
SAYS THE WARD SUPERVISOR, I'M SO
SAD WHEN I SEE THEM IN THIS
SITUATION.
THIS IS ALREADY A DIFFICULT
WINTER IN AFGHANISTAN AND AID
GROUPS SAY MORE CHILDREN COULD
DIE OF STARVATION THAN ALL THE
CIVILIANS WHO WER
