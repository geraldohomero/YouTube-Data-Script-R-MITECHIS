hospital bed without having a loved one
to hold her hand filled anhar el diques
thoughts while in prison
she is mom to an 18 month old daughter
and is expecting to deliver a son next
week
on thursday an israeli judge citing the
risks of kovid 19 put her on house

recover from giving birth alone with no
one by my side not my husband no one
from my family those were the hardest
moments

groups have documented only 10
palestinian women giving birth in
israeli prisons since 1967.
the last baby born was in 2008.
eldig's case caused an uproar among
palestinians
with less than two weeks before she is
expected to give birth
her attorney was able to convince the
court that keeping a depressed pregnant
woman in a jail cell was not the only
option

prison guarantees from a doctor to
follow up social services to help family
