The other big title is this turnaround
also for Gaza after 5 months of war
The Security Council has just passed its
First resolution He requests a CC
Immediate Lefeu and demands release
Immediate and unconditional of all
The hostages which changes Fanny Chauvin
Hello is that the Americans have
not put this
times not indeed and therefore it is a
diplomatic victory for the community
international by testifying to
applause in the room of
Security council after uh this vote
History eh for some nearly 6
months after the start of the war
Security council finally leaves its
paralysis and requires a lefeu
immediate uh for the duration of
Ramadan or until April 9
resolution she also requires the
Immediate euh release uh hostages
The terms of the text are clear but they
were uh debated until the last
Last minute negotiations
were intense until the end the
question the question that everyone
was the following
the United States will put its veto or
no finally Washington abstained
It necessarily marks a taking of
distance from the United States vis-Ã -vis its
Israeli historical ally when
Benjamin Netanahou wants to support
maintains his offensive in Rafa after this
Voting today in the Security Council
huh Israel eh is isolated huh
On the international scene here is a
terrestrial offensive and Netaniahou
says he will not send the
Israeli delegation expected to
Washington after this
American abstention Pardon Fanny
What can this resolution
change in the field in the band of
Gaza and a resolution voted at
Security advice has a value
binding she is she returned to
international law but the UN has
Not has the means to do it
applied she cannot give any
sanction huh if it is not
respected in any case what I can
To tell you is that it would not be the
first time that the Hebrew state did not
does not respect the decisions of the
international community since 1947
Israel has been the subject of more than 50
UN resolutions and condemnation which
were not respected or taken in
account
