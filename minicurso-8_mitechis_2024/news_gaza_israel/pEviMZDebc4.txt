In the Hospital Cancer Unit
Augusta Victoria Dr. Giuseppe
Greet more Personal Cap at 100 Test
it is empty
Here should be treated daily about 80
Palestinians but the void is not due to
a remission of the disease but to a
funds from September
2021 The center has been forced to
reject 500 new patients already
postpone the attention of more than 600
Interrupting protocols for me is a
catastrophe
about 40% of our patients
They cannot come to hospitals to receive
your treatments on time due to the
Lack of medications
Until now the hospital had drawn
the debt of more than 70 million
dollars of the Palestinian authority
also the pandemic and the absence of
USA under Donald Trump but did not count
with which the European Union will block its
Annual contribution for the rejection of
some members to the content of the
Palestinian textbooks
The consequences are suffered by patients
Like this 39 -year -old woman with cancer
mom and destined for the operating room if not
reaches the drug I am waiting for
almost two months
trust us
Of course I trust but I need my
treatment and please ask you
Try not to do the same with others
women

This Lutheran hospital is the only
action for cancer patients
Gaza 'and the best for the West Bank
busy
I am from Ebro the distance from the hospital of
Ramala is also providing others
hospitals but I didn't find attention
What's here we would lose a lot if this
Center would disappear
In search of money the
Doctor Fadi not only to sustain the
treatments that are in danger but help
to those who were on the sidelines and this is
very frustrating not only for me but for
All my doctors
Sometimes we fall into depression
We are trying to bring our voice to
the European Commission to tell them that
Blocking this money is hurting
Our hospital to our patients are
It is about human lives not politics
Beyond some UN aid and
Germany Fadi makes it clear that if I don't know
European funds release at the end of
June the cancer unit could leave
of working
