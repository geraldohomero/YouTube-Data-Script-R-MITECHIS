that the mobile that raised one of the
Conflict parts is religion and not
I am speaking in this case of the government
of Israel but I am talking about
Islamic resistance movement of
ever bases all your argument on
In a religious issue for that
framed within what we give in
Call Jihadist Salafism or Jihadism
Salafista and what of reading
of the Quran from a certain convenience
its justification and as the religion

possible and limited employment
of violence and treating all
means to find a negotiated exit
That is acceptable for both parties
that first allows to cease the
fire and secondly develop the
Bases of lasting peace
