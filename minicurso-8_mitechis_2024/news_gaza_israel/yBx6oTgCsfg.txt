TO ITS BREAKING POINT?
LET'S FIND OUT.
JOINING ME NOW IS CTV NATIONAL
NEWS WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF JOY
MALBON.
SHE IS IN WESTERN UKRAINE IN THE
CITY OF LVIV.
JOY, WHAT IS THE LATEST IN THAT
CITY ON THE SAME DAY THAT THE
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE SPOKE TO
CANADA?
>> WELL, THE AIR RAID SIRENS
HAVE BEEN GOING OFF ALL MORNING,
EVAN, AND AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON.
THE WAR SEEMS EVER SO CLOSE, AS
THE RUSSIANS -- AS RUSSIAN
FORCES, YOU KNOW, BRUTALLY,
BRUTAL I WILL HAVE BEEN CRUSHING
THE AREAS AROUND KYIV.
WE'VE SEEN APARTMENT BUILDINGS
ON FIRE, WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE
KILLED IN THEIR OWN HOMES,
PEOPLE TERRORIZED, METRO
STATIONS BLOWN UP, AND PEOPLE
ARE LOOKING TO THE SKIES
WONDERING ARE THEY GOING TO BE
NEXT?
IT HAS BEEN A TERRIFYING DAY IN
KYIV.
THE MAYOR THERE HAS SET A
35-HOUR CURFEW.
HE HAS ASKED EVERYONE TO STAY
INDOORS, TO STAY SAFE BECAUSE OF
COURSE THEY EXPECT IT TO GET
WORSE.
THEY HEARD EXPLOSIONS OVERNIGHT
AND THEY EXPECT MORE AS THE
NIGHT WEARS ON.
>>> JOY, TALKS RESUMED AGAIN
BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE EVEN
AS YOU SAY, AS THE ATTACKS ON
THE CAN'T CONTINUE.
WE HAD HEARD REPORTS THAT
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY HAD SAID,
LOOK, WE ACCEPT THAT UKRAINE
WILL NEVER BE PART OF NATO,
WHICH HAD BEEN A KEY RUSSIAN
DEMAND, ANY PROGRESS TO THESE
TALKS?
>> YOU KNOW, THAT WAS AN
INTERESTING THING THAT HE SAID
TODAY, AND CERTAINLY MANY PEOPLE
TOOK NOTICE.
WAS HE JUST ACKNOWLEDGING, AS HE
SAID IN SOME OF THE TRANSLATION,
THAT THIS IS A FACT, THAT
UKRAINE IS NOT A NATO COUNTRY?
OR WAS IT SOME KIND OF OFFER TO
THE RUSSIANS?
CERTAINLY, THE TALKS HAVE BEEN
GOING ON ALL DAY, AS SOME PEOPLE
SAY, WE ARE INTO A, QUOTE, FIFTH
ROUND, PART OF THE 4th ROUND,
AND PEOPLE WERE USING TERMS LIKS
WERE POSITIVE, THAT THEY FELT
CONFIDENT, THOSE KINDS OF WORDS.
BUT CERTAINLY, THERE WERE NO
BREAKTHROUGHS TODAY.
WHAT WAS INTERESTING, THOUGH,
WAS THREE NATO LEADERS FROM
POLAND, THE CZECH REPUBLIC IN
SLOVAKIA.
THEY MADE THEIR WAY ON TRAIN
INTO A WAR ZONE TO SEE PRESIDENT
ZELENSKYY, TO OFFER MORAL
SUPPORT.
THREE NATO COUNTRIES, AND IN
DOING SO, YOU KNOW, REAFFIRMING
UKRAINE'S INDEPENDENCE.
IT WAS A BIG MORALE BOOST,
CERTAINLY FOR PEOPLE HERE AND
FOR THE PRESIDENT.
BUT I WILL LEAVE THE EXPERTS TO
DECIPHER WHAT PRESIDENT
ZELENSKYY MEANT A
