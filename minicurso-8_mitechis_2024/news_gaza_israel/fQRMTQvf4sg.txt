US Secretary of State will go to Israel again
Antony Blinkan This information is coming out
His Israel for the third time amidst Gaz Jung
Tour will be discussed in peace
Antony will also go to West Bank
Blinking, what is America in Israel
This question will always be big after these visits
The same question has arisen once again
There are some important looks quickly
Israel from big ball's mother's mother on facts
In America, yes for the third time in oil,
When will you come for the first time, 18
On October 14 for the second time on October and now
See this week, October November
December is also West Bank with Tel Aviv
Sameer will continue to vote for the visit Blinking
Absolutely to carry on the ceasefire
Strategy will be made indicated
A solution to the release of all hostages will be discovered
Even on reducing stress in middle East
Discussion is possible but is it possible
Will there be less tension in the middle East
There is no chance in the time
Discussed about the elimination of Hamas
There is also an apprehension of Blinking
America has its own concerns in the tour
Do you think Sardana sir Antony
America's arrival in Israel like this
What are your concerns due to which
America so much in this war
Look at America's evaluation 7
After October attack
So even if they send their ships
His leaders come, that is his full support
Proxy from Israel in a way
War is fighting Israel himself
Is but America's concerns because
This is not Ukraine Russia for him
Here he himself is so directly
Evolved is his citizens also evaluated and
And definitely talk about peace
There are ceasefire, there should be peace but
As long as Hums Infrastructure Military
Infrastructure does not end so that
This method is not again at Israel
I do not think America does not think of these
More serious in peace efforts
First of all, we will end the military
Infrastructure ends only after that
