in the northern israeli city of um
mourners carry the coffin of 17 year old
muhammad kiwan
his family says he was shot in the head
and killed
by undercover israeli officers
[Applause]
his death comes amid rising tensions
between israelis and palestinian
citizens of israel
[Applause]
the day he was shot police say they
responded to reports of men who were
trying to attack israeli motorists
they opened fire at a vehicle that had
run over a cop
and they say they're now investigating
whether kiwan was in the car that was
hit
in the shooting in the streets there's
grief
and outrage
it was far too young people have come
from all over israel and palestine to
attend this funeral
i think that the israeli security forces
intentionally kill
them to scare off their youth
kiwan's funeral morphed into a protest
against violence and discrimination of
palestinian israelis
as long as there is provocation against
us and our religious sites it will be a
difficult situation
there is provocation from the settlers
who are being supported by the israeli
government
we are protesting because we have our
dignity dignity is the only thing we
have now palestinian citizens of israel
make up 20 percent of the country's
population
most people who live in umar fahm speak
arabic and hebrew
they often complain of systematic
discrimination unfair access to housing
health care
and education the last time
violence broke out inside israel by
palestinian israelis was in september
2000
during the second intifada but many here
say this time around the intercommunal
unrest is much
worse and regardless of the cease-fire
between hamas and israel
many believe the simmering tensions will
not fade
