it's about time we stop those of us who
support as most of us do
israel in this body for apologizing for
our support for israel
there is no apology to be made none
it is the best three billion dollar
investment we make
whether or not in israel the united
states of america would have to invent
an
israel to protect her interest in the
region
the united states would have to go out
and invent an israel the second part is
people should understand by now that
should be crystal clear
that israel israel is the single
greatest strength
america has in the middle east i always
say to my friends when they say those
things to you
i say imagine our circumstance in the
world
were there no israel how many
battleships
would there be how many troops would be
stationed
you know i used to say earlier when i
was a kid i'd say when i was a young
senator i say if i were do i be a
zionist i am a zionist
you don't have to be a jew to be a
scientist progress occurs in the middle
east
when everyone knows there's simply no
space between the united states and
israel
there is no space between the united
states and israel when it comes to
israel's security there is only one
nation
only one nation in the world
that has unequivocally without
hesitation
and consistently confronted the efforts
to delegitimize israel at every point in
our administration at
every juncture we've stood up on the
legitimacy
on behalf of legitimacy of the state of
israel
the security of israel in the united
states is inextricably tied
and we will never ever ever abandon
israel
out of our own self-interest
[Applause]
i also emphasize what i've said
throughout this conflict
the united states fully supports
israel's right to defend itself
against indiscriminate rocket attacks
from hamas
and other gaza-based terrorist groups
that have taken the lives of innocent
civilians
in israel
