>>> WELCOME BACK, FBI DIRECTOR
>>> WELCOME BACK, FBI DIRECTOR
CHRIS WRAY NOW WITH A WARNING
THIS MORNING, HE SAYS THAT LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE SEEN
AN INCREASE IN THREATS AGAINST
JEWISH AND MUSLIM AMERICANS HERE
IN THE U.S.
THIS AS WE FOLLOW JUST A TRAGIC
STORY OUT OF ILLINOIS, THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS NOW
OPENED A FEDERAL HATE CRIME
INVESTIGATION AFTER A 6-YEAR-OLD
BOY WAS STABBED TO DEATH, AND
HIS MOTHER WAS CRITICALLY
INJURED IN WHAT POLICE SAY WAS
AN ANTI-MUSLIM HATE CRIME.
JOINING US NOW AND NBC'S SHAQ
BREWSTER, OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE
WHERE THIS CASE IS HAPPENING.
WHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> Reporter: HI THERE, ANA,
POLICE ARE CALLING THIS A
SENSELESS AND COWARDLY ACT OF
VIOLENCE.
WHEN YOU LISTEN THE DETAILS
WHICH ARE EXTREMELY DISTURBING
YOU GET AN UNDERSTANDING WHY
THEY'RE SAYING THAT.
POLICE RESPONDED TO A REPORT OF
A STABBING AROUND 11:30 MM
SATURDAY EVENING OR SATURDAY
NIGHT.
THEY SAY WHEN THEY GOT TO THE
HOUSE THEY SAW A MOTHER AND HER
6-YEAR-OLD BOY IN A BEDROOM WITH
MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS.
ANA, THAT 6-YEAR-OLD BOY WADEA
AL FAYEOUME STABBED 26 TIMES,
TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH
A 12 INCH BLADE OR KNIFE STILL
IN HIS ABDOMEN.
HE LATHE DIED AT THE HOSPITAL.
THAT MOTHER IS STILL IN THE
HOSPITAL, HER FAMILY SAYS, IN
CRITICAL CONDITION FIGHTING FOR
HER LIFE.
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO WHAT POLICE
ARE SAYING, THEY'RE SAYING THIS
WAS A CLEAR ACT OF ANTI-MUSLIM
HATE, IF I'M QUOTING THEM
DIRECTLY, WHEN THEY SAY BOTH
VICTIMS WERE TARGETED DUE TO
THEM BEING MUSLIM AND THEY
CONNECTED THE ACTION TO THE
ONGOING VIOLENCE AND WAR IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
WE KNOW THE SUSPECT WAS
ARRESTED.
HE IS GOING TO BE APPEARING IN
COURT LATER TODAY.
HE'S FACING MULTIPLE CHARGES,
INCLUDING HATE CRIME, INCLUDING
FIRST DEGREE MURDER, AND WHEN WE
HEARD FROM THE FAMILY YESTERDAY
AS THEY ATTENDED A PRESS
CONFERENCE, I WANT YOU TO LISTEN
TO A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THEY
SAID BUT BOTTOM LINE IS THEY
WANT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS
CRIME.
>> TO BRING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR
HIS LIFE TAKEN TOO SOON.
HE'S SAYING, BASICALLY, THAT THE
MEMORY OF HIS SON WILL LIVE WITH
THEM, BUT FOR THEM TO FEEL THAT
THIS LIFE WAS MEANINGFUL TO THE
COMMUNITY, TO SOCIETY, TO THIS
COUNTRY.
ACCOUNTABILITY, JUSTICE HAS TO
MEET YOU.
