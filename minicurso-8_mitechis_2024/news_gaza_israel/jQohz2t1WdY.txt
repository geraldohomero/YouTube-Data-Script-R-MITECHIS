THROUGH THE WEEKEND.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Gillian: FIVE SHIPMENTS OF 
U.S. MADE WEAPONS HAVE ARRIVED 
IN ISRAEL.
MORE ARE ON THE WAY.
INTERCEPTORS ARE LANDING IN THE 
COUNTRY BY THE PLANE LOAD.
THE U.S. IS GIVING FREE REIN HOW
TO DEPLOY THE WEAPONS.
SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT 
RICH EDSON JOINS US FROM THE 
PENTAGON WITH THE DETAILS.
>> THAT ASPECT IS TO HELP THE 
ISRAELI WAR EFFORT.
THERE IS ANOTHER ASPECT TO ALL 
OF THIS, AIRCRAFT CARRIERS, WAR 
PLANES, U.S. TROOPS HEADED TO 
THE MIDDLE EAST WITH A MESSAGE 
TO IRAN-BACKED MILITIA'S NOT TO 
EXPAND THE CONFLICT.
WE HAVE NEWS ON THAT.
IN IRAQ OVERNIGHT U.S. OFFICIALS
CONFIRMED TO FOX NEWS THAT 
OVERNIGHT THE MILITARY 
INTERCEPTED ONE-WAY KAMIKAZE 
DRONES TARGETING THE AIR BASE IN
IRAQ WHICH HOSTS U.S. TROOPS.
OFFICIALS DECLINED TO SAY WHO 
THEY THINK LAUNCHED THE GROUPS.
THE U.S. HAS 2500 TROOPS IN 
IRAQ.
IRAN-BACKED MILITIA'S HAVE 
ATTACKED THE AIRPORT BEFORE.
THE PENTAGON SAYS AMERICAN 
WEAPONS ARE ARRIVING IN ISRAEL 
ON A NEAR DAILY BASIS AND THE 
PENTAGON IS WORKING TO FULFILL 
ISRAELI REQUESTS AS QUICKLY AS 
IT CAN.
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IS GIVING
ISRAEL THE ABILITY TO USE 
AMERICAN WEAPONS WITH A WIDE 
LATITUDE.
>> WE DID NOT PUT ANY 
PRE-CONDITIONS ON ISRAEL WHEN IT
COMES TO USING OUR SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE.
GOVERNMENTS LIKE US ARE WHAT 
SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM HAMAS.
WE CERTAINLY EXPECT ISRAEL, AS 
WITH ANY ALLY OR PARTNER, TO 
UPHOLD THE LAW OF WAR.
>> THE 26TH MARINE EXPEDITION 
UNIT AND 2,000 MARINES AND 
SAILORS IS MOVING CLOSER TO 
ISRAEL THROUGH THE RED SEA.
PENTAGON SAID THE UNIT CAN 
EXECUTE AMPHIBIOUS MISSIONS, 
ENGAGE IN LIMITED CONTINGENCY 
OPERATIONS.
OFFICIALS SAY THIS UNIT DOESN'T 
HAVE ORDERS.
THE PRESIDENT OR DEFENSE 
SECRETARY CAN CHANGE THAT.
THE PENTAGON SAYS IT IS GIVING 
2,000 TROOPS THE ORDER TO 
PREPARE TO MOVE OUT 24 HOURS 
NOTICE.
THAT ORDER HAS NOT YET BEEN 
GIVEN BUT IT ALLOWS THE 
ADMINISTRATION SOME LATITUDE IF 
IT FEELS IT WH
