AFTER THE OK, OK?
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW
LET'S LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE EQUATION, WHICH IS THE
MILITARY SIDE. ALL RIGHT. AND
YOU HAVE TO DO BOTH. YOU HAVE
TO DO BOTH FORMER IDF COUNTER
TERROR OPERATIVE AARON COHEN.
AARON, IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
GOOD TO SEE GAME, CHRIS.
SO I UNDERSTAND
STRATEGICALLY AND IN TERMS OF
MANDATE OF EXISTENTIAL THREAT,
WHY ISRAEL BELIEVED IT NEEDED
TO REACH OUT AND TOUCH THE
IRANIAN GENERALS IN DAMASCUS.
BUT OF COURSE, THERE HAS TO BE
AN EXPECTATION OF RETALIATION.
SO THESE HEADLINES, I'M SAYING
THAT ISRAEL IS LIKE IN PANIC
MODE. YOU HAD TO KNOW THAT
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. SO
WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION OF
WHAT THE NEXT WAVE BRINGS?
WELL, CHRIS, IT'S A GOOD THE
ONLY THING I CAN REALLY SPEAK
TO ON A STRATEGIC LEVEL.
AS FAR HOW ISRAEL WOULD BE
THINKING RIGHT NOW, HE'S BASED
ON 3 KEY THE FIRST THING IS
ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE. SO
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE CHATTER
IS, OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE
AN EXPECTATION. BUT REMEMBER,
CHRIS, IT WAS ME GETTING FOR
THE LAST 6 MONTHS OUT OF
SOUTHERN LEBANON, WHICH WAS IN
DIRECT CORRELATION TO GENERALS
AD WHO WAS THE GENERAL THAN
ISRAEL TARGETED IN THAT
AIRSTRIKE. HE WAS THE GROUND
COMMANDER FOR ALL SOUTHERN
OPERATIONS. ATTACKING ISRAEL,
WHICH HAS DISPLACED ALMOST
100,000 ISRAELIS OUT OF THE
NORTH. SO ISRAEL ACTING IN A
IN A DEFENSIVE CAPACITY THERE.
HOWEVER, THE MAIN POINT WITH
ISRAEL AND HOCAN DO MILITARY
OPERATIONS WILL BE BASED ON
ACTIONABLE MOST IMPORTANT
THING. SO THE MOMENT ISRAEL
HAS ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE
WHICH COULD LEAD TO A CLUSTER
OR THOUSANDS OF DRONES, WHICH
I'M HEARING OR A MISSILE
STRIKES COMING INTO ISRAEL
FROM IRAN. ISRAEL STRENGTH
CHRIS WILL BE WHEN IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN, WHICH IS PRETTY EMPTY OF
ATTACKING. AND IF ISRAEL FEELS
IT MUST PREEMPTIVELY ENGAGE
IRAN, WHETHER IT'S ON IRANIAN
SOIL OR IN SYRIA OR IN
LEBANON, IT WILL DO SO. AND
THAT IS WHAT THE SURVIVAL OF
ISRAEL RELIES ON WAS. AND 67
