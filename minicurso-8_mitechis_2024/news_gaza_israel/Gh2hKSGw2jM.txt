MINUTES, HOPEFULLY SEE SOME 
HOSTAGES.
BRING IN KT McFORL  -- THIS IS 
REALLY EXPORTION.
>> YEAH, OF COURSE IT IS EXTORG 
AND THIS IS MOMENT OF GREATEST 
VULNERABILITY FOR ISRAEL.
HAMAS KNOWS THEY CANNOT DEFEAT 
ISRAEL ON THE BATTLEFIELD OR 
ECONOMIC PLAYING FIELD.
HAMAS ONLY CHANCE TO DESTROY IS 
PUBLIC RELATION FIELD 
DIPLOMATICALLY.
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, 
HAMAS WILL RELEASE PRISONERS AND
SECOND TRAUNCH OF THEM AND 
ISRAEL WILL RELEASE, THEY ARE 
NOT HOSTAGES, THEY ARE 
TERRORISTS WHO HAVE LAWFULLY 
BEEN PUT IN JAIL.
IT IS NOT EQUIVALENT.           
AFTER THIS FIRST BATCH ARE 
RELEASED, THERE WILL BE PRESSURE
WITHIN ISRAEL AND THE WORLD TO 
GET MORE HOSTAGES, GET MORE 
BABIES HOME TO THEIR PARENTS AND
GRANDPARENTS AND THE WORRY IS 
ISRAEL WILL BE PRESSURED TO 
STOP.
ISRAEL KNOWS IT HAS TO DEFEAT 
HAMAS COMPLETELY, DESTROY 
POLITICAL AND MILITARY 
LEADERSHIP AND AMMUNITION DUMPS 
AND IF ISRAEL IS NOT ALLOWED, 
THIS PROBLEM COMES BACK AGAIN 
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE 
WORLD PUBLIC OPINION IS 
CHANGING.
>> Brian: AND KT, START GETTING 
SOME RESCUES, ANOTHER REASON TO 
HAVE OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PRESSURE 
IS LIKE ON JOE BIDEN, HIS PARTY 
IS FRACTURING UNDER HIS 
>> THE PROBLEM JOE BIDEN HAS GOT
AND I'M SURPRISED BIDEN HAS 
STAYED AS LOYAL AS HE HAS SO 
FAR.
HE IS WITH ISRAEL AND BACK 
STOPPING ISRAEL WITH MILITARY 
SUPPLIES AND GIVEN THEM 
DIPLOMATIC COVER AND VISITED 
ISRAEL, THE PRESSURE IN HIS OWN 
PARTY ARE FALLING APART AND 
HE'LL HAVE TO APPEAL TO THE BASE
OF HIS PARTY THAT IS 
ANTISEMITISM AND FEELS LIKE 
EQUIVALENCE THAT PALESTINIANS 
ARE JUST AS BAD AS ISRAEL AND IT
IS ISRAEL'S FAULT.
THE WORLD HAS TURNED AGAINST 
ISRAEL, EUROPEAN DEMONSTRATIONS.
THE ASIANS AND CHINESE, THEY 
NEVER BACK THE ISRAELIS, THEY 
COULD BE BACKED IN
