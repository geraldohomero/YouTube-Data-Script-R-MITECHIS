many of these homes in the village of
surbaher took months to build their
palestinian owners watched them torn
down in a day
it's a tough feeling
pictures can tell the story better than
words can
they have demolished our dreams and
homes they've completely destroyed us
we've been building our house for six
years now in the end the israelis came
and demolished it
more than two dozen residential
buildings with scores of apartments are
set to be flattened
the palestinian council of ministers
severely condemns this serious attack
and considers it a continuation of the
policy of forced displacement of the
jerusalemites from their homes
this is a war crime and a crime against
humanity as stated in international
humanitarian law and in international
criminal law
israel authorities say the land they
were built on wasn't licensed for
palestinian settlements
but residents say it's a ploy by israel
to take over occupied land
these houses are permitted by the
palestinian ministry of local government
so the residents have permitted to build
here now the permits are being violated
by the israeli occupation forces
that military doesn't care about
international or humanitarian law and
doesn't care about ethics under the oslo
agreement the gaza strip and the west
bank were divided into three zones a b
and c
the palestinian authority has full
control of area a it shares area b with
israel which has full control of area c
but palestinians say there is not enough
space for them and the no build buffer
zone israel declared on either side of
the barrier it implemented in 2011 has
made things more cramped
we are now awaiting our fate we hope
these homes are spared if they are
demolished god forbid where will we go
i live with my family and my son's
family here there are nine of us here
israel says some buildings serve as a
hiding place for terrorists but
palestinians say israel is using
security as a pretext to force them out
for their home
party hostile world
occupied west bank
