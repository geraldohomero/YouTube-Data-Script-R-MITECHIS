TOYOTA CAMRY THAT KILLED THE
JONES COLLEGE PREP TEACHING
ASSISTANT, A $5,000 REWARD
IS NOW BEING OFFERED FOR ANY
INFORMATION ON. PRESIDENT
CRITICISM OF ISRAEL'S PRIME
MINISTER OVER HIS HANDLING
OF THE WAR IN GAZA. REBECCA
CASTRO HAS MORE ON THOSE
COMMENTS. THIS WHILE THE US
HAS NOT WAVERED IN ITS
SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IN ITS
WAR WITH HAMAS, PRESIDENT
JOE BIDEN IS NOT SHYING AWAY
FROM CRITICIZING HIS ISRAELI
THINK WHAT HE'S DOING IS A
MISTAKE, AND I. ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU TELLING A GROUP OF
ARMY RECRUITS JUST YESTERDAY
THAT THE ARMY WILL PUSH
FORWARD WITH PLANS TO ROOT
OUT HAMAS IN RAFAH, A
STRONGHOLD IN SOUTHERN GAZA,
WHERE MORE THAN A MILLION
PALESTINIANS ARE ALSO
SHELTERING. THIS IS NOT THE
BEST WAY FORWARD. THERE ARE
HAMAS AND RAFAH. US
OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED
INVADING RAFAH WILL LEAD TO
A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER.
MEANWHILE, NEGOTIATIONS FOR
RELEASE HAVE STALLED,
LIMITING THE AID ARRIVING IN
GAZA. I THINK THERE'S NO
EXCUSE TO NOT PROVIDE FOR
AND THE AND THE FOOD NEEDS
OF THOSE PEOPLE. BUT HAMAS
IS NOT THE ONLY THREAT.
ISRAEL IS WATCHING. WITH
THEIR FOREIGN MINISTER
THREATENING TO STRIKE IRAN
DIRECTLY IF ISRAEL IS
TERRITORY. THIS FOLLOWS
IRAN'S PROMISE TO RETALIATE
AGAINST ISRAEL FOR AN ATTACK
ON AN IRANIAN CONSULATE IN
SYRIA LAST WEEK. WE HAVE NO
INTEREST TO START ANOTHER
FRONT WITH IRAN. SO FAR THEY
ARE USING PROXIES AGAINST
US, BUT IF THEY WILL MAKE
THAT MISTAKE, THEY WILL PAY
A HEAVY PRICE. PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND PRIME MINISTER
NETANYAHU SPOKE ON THE PHONE
LAST WEEK IN THE WHITE
HOUSE, SAYS BIDEN THREATENED
TO MAKE U.S. SUPPORT FOR
ISRAEL CONDITIONAL ON THEM
TAKING STRONGER MEASURES TO
PROTECT AID WORKERS AND
