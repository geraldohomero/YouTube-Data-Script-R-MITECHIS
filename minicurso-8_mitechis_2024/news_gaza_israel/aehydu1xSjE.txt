The sort of main headline is out of
Biden overnight because really appealing
to the American people, trying to get
their support.
Yes.
For Israel, but also for Ukraine.
And as a result, joining these two
issues together, saying that both
terrorism and dictatorship don't really
know any limits.
And then as a results, they need to pay
the price.
And he's going to the American people
directly because he's coming next to the
American people for a lot of money.
More than $100 billion, we understand,
is going to be the ask from the White
House for a number of things.
We also understand from our reporting,
60 billion of that will be for Ukraine,
14 billion of it for Israeli defense, 10
billion for humanitarian efforts,
including Gaza, and then some more sort
of 20 million for various other needs
for the nation and national security.
He also came with a warning for Israel,
saying do not let rage blind you.
You need to be very strategic about what
your goals are with Hamas and to make
sure that you're pursuing them and not
missing them.
He also spoke of the Palestinians who he
says have not forfeited their right to
peace and to live undisturbed and not in
a war zone just because Hamas has a
trigger this this attack.
Now, the question is, what comes next,
The ground offensive.
We still have no clarity on timing.
We know there have still been attacks on
in Lebanon and in Gaza by the Israelis,
but also the fear of ratcheting up and
the of the spillover effects.
We hear that the United States has
intercepted missiles now coming from
Yemen.
And the question is and the attention
will turn now to Arab leaders who we
understand will convene in Cairo
tomorrow.
We understand that will be with Mohammed
bin Salman, the president of Turkey, and
foreign ministers from a number of
Western countries.
And really there is going to be a
question of de-escalation, but also how
to get aid into Gaza, which is still not
crossing the border.
