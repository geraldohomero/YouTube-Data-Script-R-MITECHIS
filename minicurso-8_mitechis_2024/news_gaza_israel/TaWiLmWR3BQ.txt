You look at the intelligence they can't function
Without the United States, they cannot function without it
The United States is right Voices in Israel they say
We have to be more independent and reduce
This dependence and reducing the affinity think you have a level
American commitment to Israel As she expresses
The same JB will remain for the next five years. No.
He knows what he’s talking about and doesn’t understand what’s going on
In the States
[Music]
Israel’s anti-Jewish alliance grew in geometric and religious columns
A very critical audience that does not see Israel as an asset
Strategic and not seen in Israel A husband at all
A reliable ally daughter we have a catastrophe every time
I don't know how I'm gonna rape you
- Today
I'm afraid I'll explain the inspiration to Similk's.
The refrigerator girl
I'm the only one risking my life every day I go through
Bullets Above your head and I protect you and you
And all of them have someone else whose fridge just is
There's someone else who didn't get it Someone's salary
You didn't get paid. Thank you very much
If we don’t get the job done, and I do
Copy that A little bit
A little pickles and some of that and some people already have them
Criticism and perhaps this goal will not be achieved
Must be achieved If it is not achieved
It will soon return to its power
Three reasons only more
One word Otherwise, we will prove that we can
The enemies around us and that weakness in the image
The Israeli will go deeper and it will bring us trouble
Much more The second is public trust
The third and final price we have paid so far
The highest price since the establishment of the state
Israel That we paid for this war can't.
To end in less than a victory we remember well
Very much the issue of personal equipment these days
The first The fighting's been missing mother-to-be
Winter is different about me
For the winter
