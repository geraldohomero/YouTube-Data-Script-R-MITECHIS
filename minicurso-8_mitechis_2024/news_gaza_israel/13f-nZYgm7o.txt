A sa
In the neighborhood and I want no unconditional wounds
Not without control. No, not to control We are now
They're actually coming in next week for the second week
We're also in the days of negotiating a release
The kidnappers are not You can tell where it is going, there is someone
That's what we're dealing with in combat. I want to
You know, one thing has to do with it The achievements things
You have another battalion that you are dismantling more ground infrastructure
Another neighborhood that's being destroyed
The population that is moving into space Safe
All these things together are pushing us
I also hope to be able to find a way to release the hostages
This is the purpose of war we have Intent to do a lot
Very much to realize it and the fighting effort is
The most effective action that helps the person who is carrying it
Giving in all sorts of places release of the hostages
That's the crane we're taking down on Homs and you guys
They are very good and need to be kept down
I am strong I hope we can translate it as well
To release

The abductees do not have conditions from wounds, not without control. No.
Not to control us Now we are entering the sea
Actually next week for the second week
There are places we've gone through at a very fighting pace
High and we're back To them again to do a tour
A very high level of space for these things
Bring more active arcs and more command posts
Destroyed We are also in the midst of negotiations
For release
The kidnappers
I canâ€™t tell you where this is going to go, there are people who are working
In this one We're engaged
In fighting I want you to know one thing has a connection between
Your accomplishments are yet another battalion you are dismantling
Another drink Land another neighborhood that's doing up there
The destruction of infrastructure and the population that is opening up to the spaces
Sure all those things are in the hole
We're being pushed, I hope Very well accomplished
About release
The kidnappers
