GAZA, BUT THE LAST COUPLE OF
DAYS, WE HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE
ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES INTO
SOUTHERN GAZA STILL.
YASMIN?
>> ALL RIGHT, ALISON BARBER FOR
US.
THANK YOU, ALISON, APPRECIATE
IT.
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS NEW
STATEMENT RELEASED BY THE
PRESIDENT OF UPON THE DELIVERY
OF THIS FIRST BATCH OF AID TO
GAZA, VOWELS IN THEY WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT.
HE ALSO DISCUSSED DISCONTINUE
EFFORT TO ALLOW AMERICANS AND
OTHER FOREIGN NATIONALS TO
LEAVE GAZA THROUGH EGYPT.
NBC'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT,
ALLIE RAFFA, IS JOINING US NOW
WITH MORE ON THIS.
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT, IF YOU
WILL, ALI, HAVE TO SAY, AND
WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION
DOING TO GET MORE AID INTO GAZA,
TO GET THAT BORDER CROSSING
PERIODICALLY REOPENS?
, YEAH ABSOLUTELY, YASMIN.
WE KNOW IT WAS ONLY OPEN FOR A
FEW HOURS TODAY.
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WILL
OPEN TOMORROW, AND IF IT, DOES
FOR HOW LONG?
THEN, THE PRESIDENT IN THIS NEW
STATEMENT SAID THEY TALKED
ABOUT THE OPENING OF THAT RAFAH
BORDER CROSSING OVER NIGHT.
HE SAYS IT WAS THE RESULT OF
QUOTE, DAYS OF DIPLOMATIC
ENGAGEMENT AT THE HIGHEST
LEVELS THAT ENGAGEMENT
INCLUDING THAT PHONE CALL THAT
PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD WITH
EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT EL-SISI ON
HIS WAY BACK TO WASHINGTON
BACKED ISRAEL, WHERE A
DISAGREEMENT WAS MADE TO OPEN
THE RAFAH BORDER CROSSING FOR
THE STATE TO GO IN.
HE ALSO SAID THAT IT'S NATIONAL
EIGHT.
AND HE SAYS THAT THE U.S. IS
WORKING ITS WORKING TO KEEP
THAT PROCESSING OPENING.
THAT SAID THE U.S. IS WORKING
WITH EGYPT AND ISRAEL TO
FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF U.S.
CITIZENS AND THEIR IMMEDIATE
FAMILY MEMBERS TO EXIT GAZA
SAFELY AND TRAVEL TO THEIR
FINAL DESTINATIONS.
YOU HEARD ALLISON TALK ABOUT
THE OVER THOUSAND 350 AMERICANS
WEST BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE
STATE APARTMENT, REQUESTING
HELP TO GET THEIR FAMILY
MEMBERS OUT.
THAT'S OUT OF THE ROUGHLY 500
TO 600 PALESTINIANS WHO ARE IN
THEIR.
AS FAR AS HOW THE
ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING TO
GET THIS DONE, THEY ARE KEEPING
THOSE DETAILS PRETTY CLOSE TO
THE VEST.
THERE ARE NOT REVEALING WHAT
GOES INTO THE BEHIND THE SCENES
TALKS ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE AS
YOU HEARD ALLISON TALK ABOUT,
THAT BORDER CROSSING ON THE
GAZA SIDE IS CONTROLLED BY
HAMAS AND, OF COURSE, U.S.
