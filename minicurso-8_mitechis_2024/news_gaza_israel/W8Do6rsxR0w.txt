Abdel Ramá on October 7 found him
In Jerusalem in full treatment of
radiotherapy for cancer in your nose
I was angry worried I didn't know
Who to call to know if my children
They were well feared for them for their
Ours
Since then this Palestinian of
78 -year -old gaza survives between
hospital that checks it regularly and
This hotel from which he calls every day
His family in Rafa despite not getting out of
This Israeli circuit has tried
Deport the strip an expulsion
postponed by the Court
Supreme at home I don't have doctors or
hospitals or medicines I want
return but my children insist that
They are not afraid of being
dangerous unlike this
Exprofesor Ahmed has nothing left in
Gaza on December 8 a bombing
Israeli in the Seitun neighborhood murdered
103 of his relatives including his wife
His three daughters his mother and four
brothers that day was talking to me
wife when a shot was heard in
The house as if it were a shot of
Warning at that time my wife

Last words that
I heard exhaust confesses that the only one
Reason to return is to fire the
his and leave this drawing of his daughter

I will come back to settle my debt and
Buy my mother and brother that still
They are under the rubble but I will not be
able to live there is difficult there are many
memories that are like a scar
Ahmed had been a year and two months
working in Tel Avib at the time of
The never blocked attacks today are blocked
In this center of Jerico with his
father and 200 former employees Gazatí to whom
Israel has also revoked its permits
Here they call the days with impotence by
Not being able to see or provide their families
For the first time in three months Mohamed
manages to speak in videoo with her daughter
that we are here we live under the same
circumstances many people have
LOST AP DARIENTS AND WE TRY
support us between

While they expect the Israeli army
Do not snatch the lives of your beings
Dear in Gaza
