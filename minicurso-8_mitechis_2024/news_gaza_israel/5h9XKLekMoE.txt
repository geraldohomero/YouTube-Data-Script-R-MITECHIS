The strong wind and rains
torrential that fell into gauze during
Wednesday night December 13
further aggravated the situations of the
displaced families tearing and
flooding the weak stores of
campaign soaking clothes and blankets
In a Rafat store camp in
A sandy terrain full of garbage
people tried to recover from one night
horrible loading sand cubes for
cover the puddles inside or outside their
stores and hanging some soaked clothes
families have tents
adequate but others manage with
Fine and transparent canvines or plastics
facts to protect things not to give
Many stores shelter
They lack soil so people
Spend the curled night on the sand
wet scratched and water fell on us
We were soaked, said Ramadan Mohad
a middle -aged man who tried
fix your family's shelter
built with shape strips
plywood and a fine sheet of
plastic we try to protect ourselves
that we could not enter water
But the rain entered this plastic no
Protects people who sleep below
said in the plastic shelters of
Other families looked torn and in
Some had puddles inside a
family had placed a block of
cement in the entrance as a dike
as well as smaller bricks in the
interior that looked like yasmine steps
Mahani said he had woken up for
The night and had found his son
less than 7 months soaked your family of
Five members share a single blanket
After an Israeli air attack
destroyed his house and made them lose one
of children as well as all their sessions
our houses destroyed martyrized
To our children and I still face
To all this is the fifth place to which
We have had to move fleeing from
one place to another with nothing more than a
T -shirt said while hung the
wet clothes outside your store if you
