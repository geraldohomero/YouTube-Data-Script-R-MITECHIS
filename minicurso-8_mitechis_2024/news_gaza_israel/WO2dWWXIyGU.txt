Israel's in a really difficult position.
So, you know, Hamas conducted this
attack with maximum brutality and, you
know, put it on camera so they know that
Israel is going to attack Gaza and that
has to be part of their plan or their
planning.
So, you know, it's now up to Israel to
figure out what well, what do we how do
we do that?
How do we achieve what we have to
achieve when Hamas not only holds, you
know, more than 100 hostages, but also,
you know, expects us to do, you know, to
make this attack and then what happens
elsewhere?
What happens with Hezbollah from
Lebanon, what happens with, you know,
Iran?
And, you know, how do we avoid this
becoming a wider war?
Very, very difficult.
So, Mark, your latest piece as the prime
minister again has set out a good
framework for Israel to respond.
Tell us more about the plan.
And I guess what you're saying is that,
you know, if it's not measured, then how
bad could everything get?
Yes.
So so essentially what he said was, you
know, first of all, we need to clear out
the remaining Hamas fighters from, you
know, the border area, secure the
border.
So that's you know, that's clear, that's
doable, non-controversial.
Then the next thing is to exact a price
on Hamas.
And so that's a quite flexible, you
know, time that it needs.
And, you know, a lot of maneuvering for
just just what that price is.
And he says it will include going into
Gaza, that that's inevitable.
So but at the same time, he says that we
need to secure our borders to make sure
that, you know, we don't have other
parties, you know, moving into the
conflict.
So that shows that they seem to
understand it's a balance that they that
they need, you know, that there is this
risk of escalation, which is quite real.
And then finally, you know, unity within
Israel.
It's been extremely divided recently and
and a level of hand which, you know, all
of which is exactly what they need to
do, whether they will be able to, you
know, given the nature of what Hamas is
done, is is really very, very difficult.
I mean, it's a tough, tough, tough
proposition.
