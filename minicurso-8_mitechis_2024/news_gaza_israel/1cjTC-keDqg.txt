It's midday this Friday everything
Life ends in the territories
Palestinians it's prayer time
during this troubled period the mosque
Abdel Nasser of Ramala is a point of
unmissable gathering in its
Sermon Imam recalls horrors
suffered by the Palestinians
Gaza blood shed schools
hospitals and mosques
bombed and he talks about a fight to finish
Between Jews and
Muslim a preaching addressed to faithful
Already
convinced here all say they are victims
occupation and all feel
galvanized by the surprise attack of
Hamas on October 7, Abdrahman
Kani came here with his two children
to make them live what is to his
eyes a turning point
History is the start of walking
towards our freedom he says there is
now a before and after this

Halt the Hamas flags make
their appearance and the crowd is
Walk a long challenge before the city
where the slogans have been taken up in unison
the glory of the armed branch of
Hamas the routine is well established and
Each time the destination is the same
The Jewish colony of Beel Théâtre de Tous
The clashes The implantation is
well kept from Israeli soldiers
heavily armed protects the colonists and
prevents all Palestinian from approaching
But the images of the Gaza bombing
give heart to the stomach to
activists we are victims
Israelis are terrorists said
This one the Israeli soldiers are at
several hundred meters but that
Do not prevent young Palestinians
to try to reach them with the
Lancepierre The exercise may seem
futile a unnecessary and dangerous bravado
Because Israeli soldiers do not

Rescous is a broom that is repeated
Since then without fa at least
three or that young people were injured
So far the Israelis are leaving
real ball a ball for a stone
A blatant imbalance to which
accustomed to young Palestinians but
indignation remains
Long live we always make
peacefully and we are pulled
above nony nobody here is armed

ream an affront which for 75 years and which
obviously not ready to
Finish here Jean-Fançis Badi Canada
