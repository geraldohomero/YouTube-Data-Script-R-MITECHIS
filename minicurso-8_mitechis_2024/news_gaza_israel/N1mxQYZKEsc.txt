Let's share bleak images
Maybe the saddest that leaves us
this war in the Middle East that are the
common graves yes when we think of the
humanity in the idea of the human in the
21st century seemed not to be seen
what happens in some parts of the world
This is Rafá is the border crossing
Between the Gaza and Egypt strip in the
North part of this territory not
have more place to put the
good corpses begin to bury them
Here in this way and one what
contributes that terrifying thing to this
situation and they photograph the
corpses because they don't know who they are
These people are then going to build a
Luck of photographic file so that
When searches begin when
Start to rebuild this place
can somehow catalog if
wants or carrying a kind of registration
But this people who die without a
Document on how difficult they are
These images very difficult to digest
No Terri is terrible because it is a country
Those are doctors not that they left their
usual trades to be neither more nor
less than workers eh good mortuari
We could not say the figure already
does the 23,000 dead believe that
There are even more dead under
debris that were not identified
But it's a matter of time because
Measure the days and advance the
research with more people
Dead this happened on the day of
yesterday the work of the
of doctors and the work of
volunteers to bury dozens of
hundreds of Palestinians who have been
killed by war in graves
common in Rafá's area and
Now notice that there is a round trip
because from Israel they accuse
operate between civilians and loading the
life of these people and from Palestine
or rather des from the Gaza Strip
What they say is are inhabitants of this
no territory if you don't want to kill them
directly do not bomb this place but
Well the dialectical war that
It also presents and of course
Here we are also giving you
We continue we continue and
we stay
In the area in a while we are going to
We will keep talking about what happens
also in Israel's policy with the
opposition leader who is asking
Del Netanyahu's resignation we make a
Pause we already return 7:19 of the
tomorrow
