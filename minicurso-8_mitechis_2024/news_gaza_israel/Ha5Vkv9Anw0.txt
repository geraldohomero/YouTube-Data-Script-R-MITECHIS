Egypt furious over missile attack in Taba
He will give a befitting reply to the attacker
Egypt has announced behind the attack
Who is under investigation from Egypt
It has been said that soon after the guilty is known
Will be answered at the right time
Egypt renovated this retaliation
Is
And see the missile has fallen on Egyptian land
Nothing is decided yet where this missile
Let's see what can be four chances
Four what are the apprehension in this whole matter
What are those apprehensions, then you see Sameer's
On the other hand, it is due to the mistake of Israel
May the missile fall here and this
Fingers are rising towards Israel
Or Israel deliberately attacked Sameer
There is also a possibility of both of them
Possibilities cannot be denied yet
You see Hama's missile can also be like this
That missed because before that
Palestine Islamic Jihad or Hamas
The success rate if you look at it
So many times it happens that this missile Dagata
Are but misfire towards Yemen
It is also a possibility that it has been tained
That is, the rebels behind it
How can you be a hand
Will Egypt deliberately assess this
Efforts are being made to evolve in war
There is another possibility that did not deny
It can be that Taba Sinai Penins
Ji and Sinai Penins in Sula in Sula
Islamic extremists connected to Al Qaeda and
Hamas is associated with Hamas which last 202
A canker for Egyptian government since year
If they remain, then if they have Hamas
This missile from Tunnels' Through A Rafa Border
If you come, they should fry them by firing
Would like to weaken the condition for CC
Would like to show problems and CC next
Elections are faced in the month of December and
This will be a weakness scene for him
That he finds out the security of his country
It would be difficult to fire
It's not difficult to find out that is okay
This from forensic analysis from radar analysis
can be traced
