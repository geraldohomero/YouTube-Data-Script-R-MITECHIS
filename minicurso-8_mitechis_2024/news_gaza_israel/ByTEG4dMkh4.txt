that post on the Israeli Embassy social
media page is completely
unacceptable I was very upset when I was
told about it and my Ministry Ministry
of Home Affairs spoke with MFA yesterday
and said that the embassy has to take
the post down
immediately and they have taken it down
the post is wrong at many levels first
it is insensitive and inappropriate it
carries a risk of undermining our safety
security and Harmony in Singapore we
look after the safety of everyone in
Singapore majority and
minority minorities that includes
Muslims Jews who are minorities in
Singapore there is a vibrant Jewish
Community here that contributes much to
our community and Country Jews here have
very little concern for their Safety and
Security po posts like these can however
inflame tensions and can put the Jewish
Community here at risk the anger from
the post can potentially spill over into
the Physical Realm so in
essence Ministry of Home Affairs has
asked had asked for the post to be taken
down and made our views very clear to
the Israeli Embassy because it is
unacceptable from the perspective of
Safety and Security in Singapore
second it is wrong to selectively Point
religious text to make a political Point
even worse in this current situation for
the Israeli Embassy to make use of the
Quran for this purpose third this post
is an
astonishing attempt to rewrite
history the writer of the post should
look at un resolutions see if Israel's
actions in the past few decades have
been consistent with the international
law before trying to rewrite history but
we didn't intervene on that basis we
told them to take it down because of the
potential consequences for the different
communities within Singapore often
embassies say and put out post
statements which we may disagree with
but we generally don't intervene because
they represent Sovereign countries they
have autonomy but where it affects the
Safety and Security of people in
Singapore the peace and Harmony that we
enjoy we do and we will
intervene
