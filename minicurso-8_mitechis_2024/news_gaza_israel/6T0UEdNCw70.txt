THE BEST FOR THOSE MOTHERS AND 
CHILDREN.
ALEX HOGAN, THANK YOU.
KEVIN.
>> Kevin: THE BIDEN 
ADMINISTRATION CLOSELY 
MONITORING THE HOSTAGE TRANSFER.
U.S. OFFICIALS ADDING THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE IS "DOING ALL WE 
CAN" TO FREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES.
LUCAS TOMLINSON HAS MORE FROM 
NANTUCKET, MASSACHUSETTS, WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT MAY BE COMMENTING 
ON THE FIRST WAVE OF RELEASED 
HOSTAGES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, KEVIN.
MOMENTS AGO THE WHITE HOUSE 
SAYING PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL 
ADDRESS THE COUNTRY IN THE NEXT 
30 MINUTES, NO DOUBT TALKING 
ABOUT THE HOSTAGES RELEASED 
TODAY.
AND GOOD NEWS 24 HOSTAGES WERE 
RELEASED, STILL 212 HOSTAGES 
THAT REMAIN IN CAPTIVITY INSIDE 
GAZA UNDER HAMAS.
AND OF COURSE, THAT INCLUDES UP 
TO TEN AMERICAN CITIZENS.
PRESIDENT BIDEN WE HEARD EARLIER
THIS WEEK SOUNDING HOPEFUL THAT 
UP TO THREE AMERICANS WOULD BE 
INCLUDED IN THIS INITIAL GROUP 
OF 50 HOSTAGES THAT ARE 
SCHEDULED, THAT ARE EXPECTED TO 
BE RELEASED OVER THE NEXT FOUR 
DAYS.
TODAY, NO AMERICANS WERE 
RELEASED AND CERTAINLY THE 
COUNTRY HOLDS ITS BREATH AND 
WANTS TO SEE AMERICANS RELEASED 
AS INCLUDED IN THIS, FOR THE 
HOSTAGES TO GET OUT.
NOW, THAT ALSO INCLUDES, KEVIN, 
3-YEAR-OLD ABIGAIL ADON.
WE HEARD HER STORY, HER PARENTS 
WERE KILLED, SHE WAITED FOR 16 
HOURS, HAD TO WATCH HER PARENTS 
SLAUGHTERED, ONE CAN ONLY 
IMAGINE THE HORROR.
YOU LOOK LEFT AND RIGHT ON THE 
COUCH, LOOK AT YOUR FAMILY 
MEMBERS, COUSINS, DAUGHTERS, 
JUST HORRIFIC.
AND CERTAINLY HER REINTEGRATION 
INTO THE WORLD WILL BE QUITE 
TRAUMATIC, BUT RIGHT NOW WE CAN 
REPORT THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS 
SCHEDULED TO MAKE AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT TO ADDRESS THE 
COUNTRY AT 1:45 EASTERN TIME 
HERE IN NANTUCKET.
WE HEARD YESTERDAY WHEN HE 
VISITED A FIRE HOUSE HIS FINGERS
WERE CROSSED HOPING SOME 
AMERICANS WERE RELEASED, THE 
WHITE HOUSE IS EXPECTING 
AMERICAN HOSTAGES TO
