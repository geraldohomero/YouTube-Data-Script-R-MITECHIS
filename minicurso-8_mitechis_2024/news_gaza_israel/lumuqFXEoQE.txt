BACK WITH US AGAIN THIS HOUR IS
ALI
ALI VELSHI IN ASHKELON, ISRAEL,
NORTH OF THE GAZA STRIP.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE
LEAFLETS THAT THE DEFENSE FORCES
ARE DROPPING IN GAZA?
ARE THEY TELLING PEOPLE TO GET
OUT?
>> Reporter: YEAH, SO THERE'S
TWO THINGS GOING ON.
ONE IS THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY.
THERE'S NO INTERNET, VERY
SKETCHY INTERNET.
IF YOU HAVE POWER, TO BE ABLE TO
POWER UP THE INTERNET, SO
COMMUNICATIONS ARE LARGELY DOWN
IN GAZA.
FOR TWO REASONS, ONE IS FOR REAL
HUMANITARIAN REASONS TO WARN
PEOPLE THERE'S BOMBING COMING.
THIS ISN'T AT THE GROUND
INCURSION.
THIS IS ABOUT THE AIR RAIDS AND
MISSILES COMING IN FROM THE SEA,
TO WARN PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS
AND IN RESPONSE TO THE FACT THAT
HAMAS HAD SAID IF YOU FIRE ON
ANYONE'S HOME WITHOUT WARNING,
THEY'LL KILL ONE HOSTAGE FOR
EVERY HOME THAT IS HIT.
IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE ARE
LEAFLETS DROPPED BY ISRAELI JETS
INTO PARTICULAR AREAS, WRITTEN
IN ARABIC WHICH ARE WARNING
PEOPLE THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE
AN ATTACK ON THE AREA AND THAT
THEY SHOULD TRY AND GET OUT.
RIGHT NOW ABOUT 300,000 PEOPLE
ARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOMES, IN
SOME CASES IT'S BECAUSE THEIR
HOMES HAVE BEEN HIT OR HAVE BEEN
BOMBED.
IN OTHER CASES, IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE GETTING OUT IN
PREPARATION OR ANTICIPATION OF
THEIR PLACES GETTING BOMBED OR
THE GROUND OFFENSIVE.
THESE LEAFLETS ARE WARNINGS
ABOUT MISSILE -- INCOMING
MISSILES, NOT ABOUT THE GROUND
INVASION.
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A VERY
DIFFERENT STORY GIVEN THE SIZE
OF GAZA.
IF THE GROUND INVASION COMES IN,
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH USE
LEAFLETS ARE GOING TO BE.
RIGHT NOW THOSE PEOPLE CAN'T GET
ANYWHERE.
SECRETARY BLINKEN WAS ASKED
ABOUT A HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR OR
THINGS TO DO.
HIS ANSWER WAS INDISTINCT.
HE SAID WE'RE WORKING ON THAT TO
PREVENT A HUMANITARIAN
CATASTROPHE BUT THERE'S ONE
UNFOLDING RIGHT BEHIND US,
ANDREA.
>> VERY BRIEFLY, THERE'S NO
PLACE THEY CAN GO.
FOR MANY OF THEM THERE'S NO
EXIT, THE BORDER CROSSING HAS
BEEN UP AND DOWN.
