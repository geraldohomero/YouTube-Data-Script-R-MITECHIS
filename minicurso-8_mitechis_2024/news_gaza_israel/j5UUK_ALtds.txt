After the air it is by the sea that the
United States intend to send help
humanitarian
Gaza I ask the US military to
carry out an emergency mission to establish
A temporary pier in the Mediterranean on
the Gaza coast that can accommodate
large ships carrying
medication water food and
shelters there will be no troops
American on the
field a device whose
United States say they have informed Israel
and which could put several
weeks to see the day help
humanitarian aid has been sent since
port of Larnaka in Cyprus located in
some 400 km from the coasts of Gaza these
food in particular would then arrive on
A temporary pier connected to the band
of Gaza which should be built with
UN teams and would allow
to transport more aid
humorous is something
welcome at the same time I can only
Repeat the air and sea lanes
do not replace the terrestrial tracks
Because so far alone a few
humanitarian convoys can arrive at
Gaza by earth due to
Israeli bombings about the
Aerial drops they stay today
they also insufficient according to the UN 2.2
million inhabitants of Gaza are threatened
of
famine and in his speech before the
Congress President Joe Biden maintains
Pressure on government
Israeli he claims to stop fire
immediate and requests the government to
Netanahou not to use the help
humanitarian as a currency
Listen to President Joe
Biden I work tirelessly for
Establish an immediate fire in order to
to release all prisoners all
hostages to bring the hostages home and
to alleviate the intolerable crisis
humanitarian aid cannot
be a secondary consideration or a
currency of exchange protect and save from
innocent lives must be a
priority if we turn to
the future the only real solution is
that of two
states
