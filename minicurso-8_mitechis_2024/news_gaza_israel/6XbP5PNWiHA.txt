No cause as fair as it is
can justify these
means is something
terrible for any human being who has a
sensitivity worthy of the name it is
Unbearable intolerable elsewhere
Whatever our positioning in
This conflict can have a sensitivity
very strong to the Palestinian cause and we
can be very critical of the government
Israeli and today
be revolted revolted by what was
after a real pog grro there is not
really others
words of people we could
Thinking there are partners of
dialogue or interlocutors are
today sometimes unable
either to name this word of terrorist or
do not denounce and clearly tell you
that they will not denounce this action
Rama I finally tell myself there
think there is a lot of hostages
ideological of this conflict that there is
Lots of people who have lost everything
freedom of all freedom of expression and
any critical sense as soon as we touch this
conflict the Hamas Charter says it
repeat their goal is not to be at the
negotiating table or
peace their goal is that Israel
disappear and that the Israelis oneself
striped from the
card every time there is a moment
crisis in the near East quite
quickly
There is a reality in reality there is
Many people who even interior
from our country perhaps
Don't wait until that is not so much a
export that a expectation of a fire
green from the near East to
TO DO
surge hatred that will strike
Of course right away through
anti -Semitism which is immediately
croissant is unthinkable and aberrant
Let us be there again here
do not feel safe in
schools in places of worship sometimes
even in the street for people
Jewish this is where there is a
very strong responsibility uh of
policies do not denounce
strongly this this terrorism to the near
Orient is in a certain way
accept that it will be put into perspective when it
will be in our streets to us
