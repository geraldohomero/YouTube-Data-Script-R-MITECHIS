And while the conflict has already entered
In his second week we could have
expect stronger involvement
American diplomacy is
Concretely of Joe Biden himself
So far it is Anthony Blinken
who had limited himself to recalling
Some of the posture pillars
American in the region a posture
All in all classic alternating the
recognition of the right of Israel to be
defend against a type attack
military as the one inflicted by the
Hamas by these rocket shots
but also the recognition of
right of peoples to demonstrate
peacefully these are Palestinians
of course traditionally the
American diplomacy and supporter of a
solution to two states but it is not
concretely at the moment the more the subject
The American political class in its
together and start with its own
Camp Le Joe Biden camp expected
President of the United States adoption
lighter posture the pressure
European pressure from
international organizations we have them
heard and even more worrying the
President is under pressure
of the left Ale of the Democratic Party
embodied by Bernie Sanders and her guard
close to young parliamentarians who
did not hesitate to take
Positions of hostility to Israel to the
Room of representatives in particular
Then Joe Biden it must be said
inherits the policy led by his
predecessor who was a policy
largely pro Israeli we
Remember but some developments
notorious enamelled Donald's mandate
trump evolution among which we find
normalization of the relationship with
several Arab countries for example and
although it is a legacy of
Tropism is not an advance on
which Joe Biden wishes to come back
Finally the exchanges with Benjamin
Natanyahu you talk about were
extremely rare during the three
first months of the mandate of the new
president and two men have
Maintained on the phone this Monday
the first significant element that in
spring you said is a call
much more frank this time from the
White House to stop fire
This night again in Gaza at night will be
long and without diplomatic pressure
American we cannot expect
an interruption of operations
Israeli soldiers before several
days
