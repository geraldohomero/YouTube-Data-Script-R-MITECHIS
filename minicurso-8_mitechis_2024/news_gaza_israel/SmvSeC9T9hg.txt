fireworks near the mosque of saint john
in akko not for celebration but
confrontation
they're fired at police by young arab
israelis
they barricaded themselves in following
rumors jewish extremists were attacking
the mosque
police try to prevent locals joining in
it's true that we're in solidarity with
al-aqsa we love al-aqsa we love
jerusalem but there's no reason to do
things like that
the city is closed the women and
children are stuck this is immature
and this violence is useless
the usually bustling city is almost
empty
hussein assadi works at the town hall he
can't recall such tensions
things got out of hand it's getting
bigger and bigger it's the first time
i've seen something like this here
his brother calls to say he's stuck in a
supermarket
where jewish extremists are threatening
customers
going to the supermarket hide in it
don't go out even if you have to sleep
there
stay inside stay
his brother makes it out
in the morning the mediterranean city
returns to a kind of normality
jewish and arab residents visit one of
the city's symbols
the uribouri restaurant jews and muslims
work here together
and it aims to be a model of
co-existence
its jewish landlord argues that that's
what was being targeted
none of these people who are here ever
believed
that this is possible what happens is
that the leadership of the arab
population in agro
have failed to understand there are some
people that are not really
happy with the coexistence that happens
here
they also chose my restaurant and my
hotel
as first to be attacked because i'm a
kind of a symbol
he says it will take two months to
repair but mending the coexistence here
will take a lot longer
we can now
