world away in Michigan Abu Ida blames
President Joe Biden for his support of
the war on Tuesday he and thousands of
others who usually support Democrats
plan to vote uncommitted in Michigan's
Democratic presidential primary I I feel
I betrayed that I voted for Biden
2020 you know we voted for somebody to
bring us democracy and Humanity on the
table well we see you know a government
that aligns with a genocidal government
to kill my
people innocent people thousands of
them hundreds of traditional Democrats

American city of Dearborn they're
demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and
pledging to vote uncommitted Dearborn

an Arab American issue this is not about
being OT or being Muslim and having an
attachment uh to the people in fan or
being related by blood this is about
people coming together and seeing right
vers wrong they're joined LED really by

Trump term over hisort for the most
right-wing government most extremist
government in the in the history of
Israel there are 300,000 Arab Americans

Victory when you've got that big of a
population um that might or might
