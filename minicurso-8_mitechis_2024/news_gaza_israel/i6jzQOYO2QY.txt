Mr Prime Minister um I'm grateful to be
back in
Israel in this incredibly difficult
moment for this nation but in fact for
the entire
world if you'll permit me um personal
aside I come before you not only as the
United States Secretary of
State but also as a
Jew my grandfather Maurice
blinkin fled pilgrims in
Russia my
stepfather Samuel
pizar survived concentration camps aitz
DACA myid
donic so prime minister I understand on
a personal
level the harrowing Echoes that hamas's
massacres carry for Israeli Jews
indeed for Jews everywhere the people of
Israel have long and rightly prided
themselves on their self-reliance on
their ability to defend themselves even
when the odds are stacked against
them the message that I bring to Israel
is this you may be strong enough on your
own to defend yourself but as long as
America exists you will never ever have
to we will always be there by your
side that's the message that President
Biden delivered to the Prime Minister
from the moment this Crisis began it's
the message that I and my other
colleagues in the government have
delivered to our Israeli counterparts on
a daily even an hourly
basis it's the message that I bring with
me to our discussions today and it's
what I'll affirm when I meet with the
members of Israel's newly formed
National Emergency government we welcome
the the government's creation and the
unity and resolve that it reflects
across Israel
Society we're delivering on our word
supplying ammunition interceptors to
replenish Israel's Iron Dome alongside
other defense
material first shipments of US Military
Support have already arrived in Israel
and more is on the
way as Israel's defense needs evolve we
will work with Congress to make sure
that they're met and I can tell you that
there is overwhelming overwhelming
bipartisan support in our Congress for
Israel security
