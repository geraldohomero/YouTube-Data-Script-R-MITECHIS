Gaza which is one of the most densely
populated places in the world is home to
approximately 2.3 million
Palestinians almost half of them
children for the past 96 days Israel has
subjected Gaza to what has been
described as one of the heaviest
conventional bombing campaigns in the
history of Modern
Warfare Palestinians in Gaza are being
killed by Israeli weaponry and bombs
from Air Land and
Sea they are also at immediate risk of
death by
starvation dehydration and disease as a
result of the ongoing Siege by Israel
the destruction of Palestinian towns the
insufficient Aid being allowed through
to the Palestinian population and the
impossibility
of Distributing this limited aid while
bombs
fall this conduct renders Essentials to
life
unobtainable at this provisional
measures stage as this court has made
clear in The Gambia Myanmar case it is
not necessary for the court to come to a
final view on the question of whether
Israel's conduct constitutes General
side it is necessary to establish
only whether at least some of the acts
alleged are capable of falling within
the provisions of the
convention Israel has a genocidal intent
against the Palestinians in
Gaza that is evident from the way in
which Israel's military attack is being
conducted which has been described by
Miss Hass s
c it is systematic in its character and
form the mass displacement of the
population of Gaza headed into areas
where they continue to be killed and the
deliberate creation of conditions that
quote lead to a slow death
unquote there is also the clear pattern
of
conduct the targeting of family homes
and civilian infrastru structure laying
waste to vast areas of Gaza and the
bombing shelling and sniping of men
women and children where they stand the
destruction of the health infrastructure
and lack of access to humanitarian
assistance
