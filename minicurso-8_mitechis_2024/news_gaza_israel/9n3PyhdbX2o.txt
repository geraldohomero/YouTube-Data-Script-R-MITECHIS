to israeli police it's almost as bad as
a weapon
wherever they see it whether at a
protest or a funeral ceremony they take
it away
even the funeral of shurina bakley
attended by thousands wasn't an
exception but israel universities have
enjoyed relative freedom until now
recently eli kohan from the leading
opposition party liquid sponsored a bill
banning so-called enemy flags including
that of palestine
and it's now before the knesset for a
preliminar hearing on wednesday
palestinian students in israel
university say that it's an attack on
their identity
on the table is the result of
governmental fear
as long as they see the youth girls and
boys active in the streets and raise
their flag they are afraid of this they
want to separate us from our national
identity
and symbols
the issue arose after students at ben
gurion university displayed palestinian
flags to commemorate the nagpa
also known as the great catastrophe
during which more than 700 000
palestinians were displaced by jewish
forces in 1948.
right-wing israelis took exception to
this
but unr is really low waving palestinian
flags in israel is not a crime in 2003
the israeli supreme court alot of
political parties to broadcast election
ads that featured palestinian flags
arguing that it was protected by freedom
of speech in 2021 the magistrates court
in jerusalem ruled that a protester who
was arrested for waiving a palestinian
flag should be released finding he had
committed no criminal act
one key issue to be examined is whether
the palestinian flag would even fall
into the category of enemy flag
either two muslims from the jointless
party says the issue is one of
sovereignty it's a very dangerous step
that this government is doing adding to
other things that they
have been deteriorating the situation
with it's delegitimizing
the palestinian flag it's delegitimizing
whoever wants to raise this flag or to
hold it
the ministerial committee on legislation
has given each lawmaker in the coalition
freedom to vote based on their
conscience
with right-wing parties in the coalition
the bill is expected to pass the
preliminary hearing and if it is signed
into law israel will be one step closer
to scrubbing palestinian symbols of
identity from its institutions muslim
fathers world west jerusalem
