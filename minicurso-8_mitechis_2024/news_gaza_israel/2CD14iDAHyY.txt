political ties with Israel at least for
a limited period of time Ali K made
those comments while attending the

Hypersonic ballistic missile called fata

unmanned drone that Iran unveiled in
2021 which it named Gaza in in tribute
to Palestinians DS Jabari has more now

chance for Iranian officials to showcase
the latest de development to their
commanderin-chief Ayatollah Ali Kam now

have that are different from the
previous Hypersonic ballistic missile
that Iran unveiled back in June firstly
it has a faster speed potentially
according to officials it has the
potential to reach the speed of ma 15
that is much higher than the fatah 1 and
it also has a uh different Warhead
capability which allows the ballistic
missile to significantly change its
trajectory after a launch meaning it can
evade most air defense systems now this
is seen as a major development for
Iran's ballistic missile program uh

part of Iran's missile program that is
the biggest in the Middle East the

time being this is being seen as a uh
step for Iran to Showcase its defensive
capabilities and a warning to the
threats it's been receiving from Israel
