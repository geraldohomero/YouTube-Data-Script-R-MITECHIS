Jewish soccer team players
Macabi Berlin jump to the court
Meeting will be played under protection
Police for fear of possible attacks
Anti -Semites The club was founded by a
Holocaust survivor more than
50 years now after the attacks
Terrorists never lives one of his
Worst
moments is the only game of this
level with such a police presence
We are at a time when
Jews hide their religious symbols
for fear of showing them for the
street the same day more than 1000
Palestinian own protesters protest
In Berlin against the bombing
Israelis on the Gaza Strip
Police had prohibited demonstration
for fear of possible slogans
Anti -Semites Imbbal fails to assimilate what
That this young Israeli has passed
Remember the moment you received the
First news about the attacks of
My sister never started to receive
Known messages that were there and
To recognize people in the you and
Then our mother explained that
Our cousin was missing there
We realized that the situation was
more serious than we thought
[Music]
Since then he has not had news of
his
cousin not knowing if he and the other reins
They continue with
[Music]
Life I try to carry a routine and
I remember myself that there are still things
Good in this
[Music]
world but unfortunately
I feel that this is only the beginning of
chaos and the
War before the game is saved a
minute of silence for the victims
Initially the meeting had
suspended to guarantee security
of the players in the macabi play
also Muslims and
Christians the club wants to launch a
Message from
coexistence we want to go beyond
sport show the world and society
that it is possible to live together and play together
As beings
humans want to serve as
example and this party shows us that
Everything can be better than we see
right now in
streets there are also Muslims among
Macabi party spectators
Some do not agree with the
Israel's response to the attacks of
There are never children and women they are
innocent have not done anything and without
embargo bombard them day and
night the game ends without incident a
Little ray of light on this day in
Berlin but many
that the situation in Israel and Gaza will go
worse after finishing filming
Inbal communicates a sad news his
cousin ha
dead
