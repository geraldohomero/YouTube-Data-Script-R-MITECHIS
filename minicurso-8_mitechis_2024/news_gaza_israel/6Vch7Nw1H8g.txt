flag marches protests clashes between
israelis and palestinians
cures in al-aqsa most compound continues
al-aqsa is a mosque inside 35 acre
compound in the old city of jerusalem
muslims refer to it as al-haram al-shari
or noble sanctuary
while it is a temple mount for the jews
there have been protests clashes and
riots at the mosque site after israel to
control of east jerusalem in 1967
to better understand the issue at
al-aqsa mosque compound let's rewind to
1947
the united nations in 1947 separated
palestine into two states for jews and
palestinians
palestine was under british control and
after separation jews were given 55
percent of the land but the palestinians
were given 45 percent meanwhile
jerusalem including al-aqsa compound was
left for the international community
under the u.n administration
in 1948 war broke out between arab and
israel after the later declared
statehood
israel captured 78 of the land west bank
east jerusalem and gaza were under
egyptian and jordanian control back then
the second arab-israel war broke out in
1967 israel eventually occupied
jerusalem including the old city and
alaska mosque
in 1980 israel passed a law declaring
jerusalem a complete and united capital
of israel

would law a cornerstone for the third
temple this led to riots in which 20
palestinians were killed
a decade later israeli politician aerial
sharon visited a laksa mosque compound
with heavy security heavy violence
followed with over 3000 palestinians and

in 2021 israeli forces stormed alexa was
compound many were wounded and dozens
were arrested the hamas of gaza
responded to this which later led to an
11-day israel-gaza war
israel has restricted the entry of
palestinians into the compound a
separation wall was built in early 2000s
which restricted entry from the west
bank into israel
the mosque is of religious significance
for muslims they are mosque and the doom
of the rock is the third holiest site
muslims believe that prophet muhammad
ascended to heaven from the doom of rock
for jews the compound is where biblical
jewish temple once stood
jewish law reportedly forbids jews from
entering the compound and trained there
