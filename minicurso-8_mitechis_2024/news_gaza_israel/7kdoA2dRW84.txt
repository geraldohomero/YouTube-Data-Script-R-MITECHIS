Israel's war is about to widen marking
their
weapons the next stage could be a
combination of air sea and land
strikes there'll be an emphasis on what
the military is describing as
significant ground
operations troops listen as a top
Commander tells them their country is
watching and from here they move
forward those who witnessed these
difficult
unimaginable sites on Shabbat will also
have the privilege of witnessing the
great victory of the IDF and the state
of Israel Over
Hamas Israeli forces are also mobilizing
in the north where they've struck
another enemy Hezbollah in next door
Lebanon last week's Carnage erupted on
this man's

with soldiers in southern
Israel they tell him about the Hamas
attack against communities here that
triggered this
war are you ready he
asks this was one of the places the
Prime Minister

hellscape Israeli forces describe what
happened here as a
massacre no rush to remove the
killers yes here in the K we met one
soldier who just found out her friend
and her partner had been confirmed dead
we traveled together and she was a good
friend and let's go to your house the
worst
news I don't know just think about your
friend who just gone and you not see him
again not have any World El and
obviously you're a soldier I mean you're
part of the military response like how
do you do you does it make you want to
have Revenge I don't want revenge I just
want Justice and if the order came would
you be ready to go into Gaza if if you
had to if I had to I will go and you're
not scared no you can see Gaza in the
distance about a mile away it's from
there that the Hamas militants came they
broke through fences like this one you
can see here the Twisted Metal as they
tore through and then Rampage through
the communities there's a heavy Israeli
military presence here now as they
prepare for the next phase in their
response and as we were standing here we
could hear the distant sound of
gunfire Israel's war on Gaza has largely
being fought from a distance for
now that's about to
