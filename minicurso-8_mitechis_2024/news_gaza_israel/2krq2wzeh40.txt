Jewish Christian and the center of Islamic faith
Jerusalem usually looks like this
[music]
There are thousands of tourists and pilgrimage daily here
Passengers arrive but on 7 October
Hamas attack on Israeli land
Change the picture completely
Diya settled at the eastern end of Israel
Strip distance from historical city is about 100
Is kilometer but between Hamas and Israel
The impact of teased war is seen on Jerusalem
Has been full of pilgrims
This city is deserted here
Shops are offering churches and others
Tricolor also empty
Islam is the third most in Jerusalem
The holy site is in this premises
Al Akasa Mosque and Dome of Rock are present
The most sacred site of Jews Temple
Mount Mount is also in Jerusalem although now only
Temple Mount's western wall remains
Holy Church of Christian Church of the Holi
Apart from this, there is 158 here
There are churches and 73 mosques to see them and
Other countries every year to pray
More than 20 lakh pilgrims from
Apart from reaching Jerusalem, there is a big
Number reaching Jerusalem from Israel
It also belongs to pilgrims who
Jerusalem is completely stopped in that place
Where there is a continuous under current
Dom of the rock on specialty, golden to you
The structure is visible
Dome you see Alak Sa Masjid
And which loves walling wall that
For Jews who are quite sacred
The site is the area which is the whole
Palestine as well as among the Jews
One of the biggest among Israel
One of the conflettes is actually Israel's
With war on the southwest border
Security in many areas of Jerusalem
Pictures of clash with forces were revealed
As a result, security arrangements in the city
Increased
Gaya pilgrims and tourists from outside
Local people also left now
Avoiding leaving, so this city ghost
Looks like a town
