We are with the Israeli army
On the way to the Gaza Strip we go
On foot because the border crossing
Hamas terrorists on the day of
Massacre
destroy here at this border crossing
Eres are the terrorists to Israel
You entered here
Israeli soldiers killed and here
you also see signs of the fights
Bullet holes in many
turn gaza is still dangerous
will continue to be from the north
So we all wear it
Protective clothing for years since the
The radical hamass in Gaza is that
Strictly guarded border with Israel
Today the soldiers just walk on foot
The Israeli army across the border
Has the northern part of the
Coastal stripes largely under theirs
Control we are now in
Gaza yes we are already in
Gaza strip about 300 m in the
We now have gas streaks
already beanun and we are moving now
Towards the terror tunnel input of this
Hamas attack tunnel is 50 m
Under the ground is 4 km long
One of the most branched and greatest
Terror tunnel networks that the
Israeli army discovered here and
The spokesman tells us neutralized
Not only electricity and water can be found here
It is an entire city under the city
In most terroral tunnels
are the ones that are larger
And there are strategically used
Everything you can shower there you can
Sleep there you can meet sessions there
You can keep people there
You can partly by car there
Drive through pictures from this
Tunnel filmed by Hamas itself
Mohammed Sinua proudly drives through the
Terror tunnel are considered his work 17
Planned for years and
Built the Israeli special unit
From engineers specializes in this
To find and destroy these tunnels
But it is a dangerous effort that
Tunnels are presumed
Explosive traps and this tunnel will also
Keep up because it could
Terrorists from the dark shaft
come the terrot tunnels in the north of the
Gaza stripes are almost complete
The Israeli says destroyed
Army and yet the war can still
Months there are more
Tunnel in Central gas and in the south of the
Gas stripes okay we have to go

But many of the more than 130 innocent
Hosts have been sitting here for three months
under the
Earth
