WRONG TO CALL THIS AN AXIS OF
EVIL, ABSOLUTELY NOT RUSSIA USED
TO BE PRO ISRAEL AND IN LINE
WITH ISRAEL AND VLADIMIR PUTIN
IS DOING THE OPPOSITE OF THAT
RIGHT NOW.
MARIA: JOIN ME SENIOR FELLOW
MILITARY EFFORT FOR DEFENSE
PRIORITY, DANIEL DAVIS DEEP DIVE
YOU TO POST AN ARMY LIEUTENANT
COLONEL.
DANIEL DAVIS THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE.
COLONEL YOUR HEARING THIS
CONVERSATION, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE
ON THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO
ISRAEL TOMORROW MORNING.
>> IT IS A MIXED BAG THERE ARE A
LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD BE
GOOD, I THINK THE FIRST THING HE
NEEDS TO GET THE AMERICANS OUT
OF THE GAZA STRIP, THOSE
AMERICANS THAT HAVE COME DOWN TO
THE RAFFLE BORDER AND TRYING TO
GET OUT THAT NEEDS TO BE
RESOLVED FIRST AND FOREMOST, HE
NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF OUR
PEOPLE.
THE SECOND THING I'M GLAD HE'S
DOING EVERYTHING THAT HE CAN TO
MAKE SURE ISRAEL DOES NOT GO
INTO HEAVY AND THEY KILL A LOT
OF INNOCENT.
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HAMAS,
ISRAEL CANNOT UNDERCUT HIS OWN
SUPPORT GLOBALLY AS WELL AS IN
THE UNITED STATES IF TOO MANY
INNOCENT PEOPLE GET KILLED IN
THE PROCESS.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY
GET RELIEF SURPRISED INTO THEIR
AS BEST AND SAFEST THEY CAN.
MARIA: IT'S A GOOD POINT TO MAKE
ON THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA IS
MEETING WITH THE HEAD OF THE
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY.
WHY NOT SAY I'M NOT MEETING WITH
YOU UNTIL THE HOSTAGES ARE
RELEASED.
>> THAT IS ONE THING HE COULD DO
BUT UNFORTUNATELY A BOSS DOESN'T
HAVE MUCH POWER, HE IS VIEWED
WITH CONTEMPT BY MOST OF HAMAS.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO
LISTEN TO HIM ANYWAY.
ALSO ON THE SAME AGENDA IS LCC
FROM EGYPT, THAT COULD BE
SOMETHING WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN
COULD BRING HIS INFLUENCE AND
SAY WE NEED TO GET THE WATERGATE
OPEN AND YOU GUYS GOTTA HELP,
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT HELPING US
OUT MUCH AT ALL.
MARIA: LET ME ASK YOU ONE MORE
QUESTION BEFORE WE GO, WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THE CAPABILITY OF THE
ISRAELI MILITARY COMEDY OF
CONFIDENCE ISRAEL CAN WIPE OUT
HAMAS GIVEN THE BACKDROP OF
HEZBOLLAH ALSO GETTING INVOLVED
HERE.
>> I'LL TELL YOU I'M REALLY
WORRIED, ISRAEL IS VERY STRONG
AND CAPABLE MILITARY BUT IF
THERE IS A SECOND FRONT OPENED
UP, IT CAN BE REALLY CHALLENGING
AND GOD FORBID IF IRAN MAKES
GOOD ON ITS THREAT TO MAKE
ADDITIONAL FRONT OR THEY GET
INVOLVED BECAUSE IF WE GET A
REGIONAL WAR THAT IS BAD FOR
EVERYBODY.
MARIA: OF COURSE.
YOU SAID SOMETHING AND
