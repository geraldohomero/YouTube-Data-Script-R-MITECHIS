more than 400 000 israeli settlers live
in the occupied west bank
after u.s president donald trump's plan
was unveiled back in january they almost
got what they wanted
a green light for annexation
effort is a settlement in the occupy
west bank in which 10 000 settlers leave
it's within the scope of the annexation
plan
and the mayor says trump's middle east
plan is good for them
the reason i fell in love with the trump
deal
is it's the first time
that there is a suggestion on the table
which actually looks at the reality that
has been created on the ground it sees
where there are jews who live and where
there are arabs who live
nowadays those settler leaders are more
busy with politics than constructing new
settlements
while netanyahu and settlers seem to be
political allies they also have
considerable differences some settlers
are worried netanyahu will not carry out
trump's plan before the us november
elections and if he loses the plan could
be reversed and some of them are
concerned about the so-called
palestinian state in trump's middle east
plan they are also afraid that isolated
settlements might stay as perpetual
enclaves rather than be annexed
settler leader david elhayan says
trump's plan shows that he is not a
friend of israel
the israeli annexation is dependent on
the acceptance of trump's plan and its
proposal to conduct direct negotiations
with the palestinians for a palestinian
state
and to freeze all construction in the
areas earmarked for the palestinian
state
some settlers oppose it as it's seen as
a compromise to their greater israeli
vision
settlers in the otnal settlement in the
okpal west bank are also against trump's
vision
when we read the plan we can see trump's
vision for peace and prosperity but when
we look at the map attached to this
vision we become worried about things
such as the establishment of a
palestinian state it's clear for us that
this wouldn't be a good thing for israel
u.s administration repeatedly stressed
that israel must accept the entire plan
to annex the parts of the occupy west
bank
and some settlers say they don't want
the plan
now it looks like netanyahu is torn
between the desires of his friends at
home and in the u.s mustafa was the art
world occupied jerusalem
