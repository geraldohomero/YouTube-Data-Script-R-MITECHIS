In America with Israel and Ukraine
Parliament in Republican Party and Democrats
There is tremendous ruckus inside
Joe Bide -led Democrats
The party is in power in America
Republican is actually in opposition
For Emergency Help of Israel in Parliament
A bill was introduced by the Crates
This bill has been blocked last week
The House of Representative passed and
The big thing is that Ukraine in this bill
No announcement was made for help
Bill only and only to help Israel
Was brought and that is why Democrats
Has imposed this bill
Democrats say that Israel
Along with this, Ukraine also needs help
Additionally this bill last month
President Joe Bide by US Parliament
Funding value of $ 106 billion sent to
Support Border Safety Fund and Hind
To curb China in the Pacific region
Democrats were actually taken on Republican
Accused of doing politics with Israeli disaster
Democrats have installed that
Republican instead of bringing a party bill
To delay helping Israeli
In the funding of internal revenue service
Cut and tell you that the US Parliament
Israel is $ 14.3 billion against Hamas
Will provide assistance but so much funding
From funding of Eater National Revenue Service
It has been cut and $ 4 billion in this fund
Israeli's Iron Dome Purchase and Davidus
Sling Defense System Purchase Short Range
To deal with the danger of rocket
Apart from American weapon reserves, some weapons
There is a provision to give to Israel and
Lecate
Approprighting cannot tolerate
Let me tell you that when this in the US Parliament
Voting was being done on the bill when both
Parties on this under party politics
Voting is done and Democrats has given this bill
Poison bullet has been said of Democrats
It is said that this bill in tax collection
By cutting the US budget deficit and
Although it will increase the Democrats
It is said that Ukraine continues to help
But the big thing is that American
To pass the bill from Parliament
Democrats will require approval
Because Democrats dominated in Parliament
Is there on the House of Representative
Republican dominance
