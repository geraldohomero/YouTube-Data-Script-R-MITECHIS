This is the early days of engagement.
What a little because I attacked a surprise attack
I think it has raised the momentum, but now
It has weakened a lot
I should see it, uh, originally Israel
This is the world's best level.
So even when I go to cover
Israeli government
On the side
There are troops specialized in the interception
But it was also attacked that surprise attack
In fact, how did Irel didn't know
So, that's why I've been watching for 20 years
In light of experience, I don't understand it
The civilians are also chasing like that
Was it shouted like that
I have doubt this right and that
It's not high, and that land
To go back and forth through the goal
If it is, the interception is done.
It is happening in the future
More precisely about Hamas' movement
Maybe I know so anymore
Even if Hamas wants to attack a surprise attack
It is not easy to do
Well, Has has no choice but to use it
Hamas is now using the tip of the cliff
If so
I am worried about the hostages a little
What will happen? Now women and children
If you look at it little by little,
I think I'm aware of it
Someone has efforts to arbitrate in the international community
I have to go in and humanitarian
The activities at the dimension are now resuming quickly
Seeing that it should be, and all the wars
I felt the bass while I was in the coverage
Uh, consultation with each other and efforts
I think it's very important
At the end of the war,
So it's over.
The international community recognizes and this situation is before
The aftermath of the world
If possible in the middle of the war, the war can be completed as soon as possible
The international community
I see you
