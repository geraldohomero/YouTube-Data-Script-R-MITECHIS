AND WE HAVE SPOKEN TO A NUMBER
OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY DON'T
KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG.
>> ALI VELSHI, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
AND JOINING US FROM TEL AVIV,
NBC NEWS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT
JOSH LEDERMAN.
THERE'S AN AMASSING OF SOLDIERS
AROUND THE BORDER.
THE BOMBING, A PAVING OF A PATH
FOR AN INCURSION.
WHAT ARE WE HEARING FROM THE
GOVERNMENT OR EVEN FROM YOUR
SOURCES ABOUT WHEN OR IF THAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN?
>> Reporter: FOR OBVIOUS
REASONS, KATY, THE GOVERNMENT
NOT TIPPING THEIR HAND ABOUT
WHEN A GROUND OPERATION WILL
START IF IT DOES OR WHAT IT'S
GOING TO LOOK LIKE.
OUR TEAMS THAT ARE IN SOUTHERN
ISRAEL HAVE NOTICED A REAL UP
TICK IN THE AMASSING OF FORCES,
OF TANKS, OF OTHER MILITARY
EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA AROUND THE
GAZA STRIP, AND SOME OF THE
ROADS THAT ARE LEADING TOWARD
THERE.
WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT
TODAY THE ISRAELI MILITARY HAS
PUT OUT A MEMO TO THE MEDIA,
URGING JOURNALISTS NOT TO REPORT
SPECIFIC DETAILS, OPERATIONAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION
OR TYPES OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT
THEY'RE SEEING ABOUT THE STATUS
OF SOME OF THOSE HOSTAGES OR
ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS TO RELEASE
THEM AS WELL AS OTHER
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION THAT
COULD POTENTIALLY UNDERMINE AN
EVENTUAL ISRAELI OPERATION.
AND TODAY, ISRAEL ALSO DECLARED
A CLOSED MILITARY ZONE AROUND
THE GAZA STRIP, SO THERE IS
ESSENTIALLY A BUFFER AREA
RUNNING ALL AROUND THE GAZA
STRIP FROM NORTH OF THE GAZA
STRIP IN ISRAEL ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO THE EGYPT BORDER THAT IS
CLOSED OFF TO MEDIA.
THEY'RE DISCOURAGING ANYONE FROM
ENTERING THAT AREA, AND SO YOU
TAKE ALL OF THAT TOGETHER, KATY,
AND YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE KIND
OF BUILD UP THAT MANY HAVE BEEN
ANTICIPATING TOWARDS POTENTIALLY
A MUCH LARGER ISRAELI OPERATION
