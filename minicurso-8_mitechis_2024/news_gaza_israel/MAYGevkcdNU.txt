3 in the morning one of the key points
It seems that now they begin to resolve
What happened to the iron dome is
say that Israeli antimisile shield that
It did not work last Saturday is
saying Israel that of course
It worked that it is not that the
problem is that the shield overflowed
Israeli antimisiles because I don't know
I expected the arrival of 5000 missiles from
5000 attacks in just a few minutes
eh did not expect an attack that from that
magnitude in normal conditions say
Mosat the system detects missiles and
alerts the population up to more than
A minute in advance did not happen but
I was not prepared for a volume of
5000 missiles from several sites in that
case the alert is barely done with
A few seconds in advance in
Normal clear conditions are attempted
also reassure the population
Isral the iron dome detects the
100% of the missiles and destroys nine of
every 10 on Saturday without telling us what was
His performance is said to be less
But how much one of 10 c of 10 7 is smaller
of 10 8 of 10 6 of 10 try to send
The quick message that the dome of
iron works the fundamental problem
It is what level a
attack environment like Saturday and
The other fundamental point is now
same in the clear message that Israel
has lived in a bubuja and that is the
also message that is giving or that
is transmitting from photography
Clear why the system failed
Israel's intelligence on Saturday
thinking they were sure despite
Live in hostile environments the problem
is that now they have realized the
hard reality and is that photography is
Even worse than you saw before
