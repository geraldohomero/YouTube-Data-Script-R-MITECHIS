in this case the Israeli government that
is telling Gaza residents
that leave the area because
bombings that were seen so far are
Nothing regarding what will happen in
The next few hours are the
images that are arriving from Israel
And of course the analysis in this case of a
representative of the Jewish community in
the Republic
Argentina the situation is enough
quite complicated and quite quite
Painful and apart has continued climbing
not eh and also what this does
situation is to break a paradigm that
It has to do with the security of
State of Israel which is
tremendously worrying a moment
there would be Israel thought
This the country that has the most borders
Safe the country of technology El Pa√≠s
of the startup that a group of people
With vans breaking up
will cause this disaster that is
living still today with one with
600 dead and how good they follow
counting and with a huge amount of
kidnapped people which this is
as a chapter that we are going to see how
closes is extremely complicated there is no
to keep in mind that war or that
The confrontations that they do is
favor the sectors more
radicalized from both sides not today
Israel has an extreme government
right with religious sectors and
It is never the most radicalized sector
eh of the Palestinians the most sectors
Extremists neither
Today is looking for a peaceful exit to
conflict that is the peaceful exit
that the
understanding the return of
Territories two villages for two states
And well and this does not exit and this and this
let's say this catization of
confrontation what it does is bring each
more dead more misfortune more
most sadness the truth
Account that this conflict already has
He is over 70 years old and never
solved although there were approaches
There were less bad moments there was moment
There were Ordo's agreements and
K David's agreements I don't see for
This dynamic that this goes to
solve quickly
