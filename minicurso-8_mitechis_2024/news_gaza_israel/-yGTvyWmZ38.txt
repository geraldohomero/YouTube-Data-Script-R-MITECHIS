let's head into the newscast with our
top focus on israel election as the
israeli prime minister benjamin
netanyahu's prospects
for another term look uncertain after
partial results projected
no clear path to victory israel's world
beating covert 19 vaccination rollout
was a central pillar
of netanyahu's campaign but even that
wasn't enough for nathan yahoo to break
through the political deadlock
that has seen four elections in two
years immediately after polls closed
nathaniel
claimed victory and said he hoped to
form a stable right-wing government
but with about 88 of the votes counted
neither netanyahu nor his centre-left
opponents won a stable majority
in the 120-seat parliament netanyahu's
right-wing block fell
short of a governing majority and it has
a less clear route to forming a
coalition
to secure another top netanyahu would
have to put together a coalition from a
combination of right-wing allies
ultra-orthodox parties
ultra-nationalists arabs and defectors
should a hard right government emerge it
would likely be at loggerheads with the
democratic administration
of u.s president joe biden over issues
such as palestinian statehood and u.s
engagement
with israel's arch enemy iran over its
nuclear programme
now palestinian prime minister mohammed
shah said the outcome does not really
give any hope for peace
and that the israeli political system
had shifted to the right
nathan yahoo has sealed historic deals
with several arab nations
to normalized ties but israel and the
palestinians have not held direct
negotiations
since 2014 when peace talks broke down
