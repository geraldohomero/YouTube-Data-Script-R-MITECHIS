 
WE STARTED BARRICADING THE DOOR 
UP IN A FEW OF US WERE LOOKING 
OUT THE WINDOWS TO SEE IF WE 
COULD SEE ANYONE COMING OVER. 
WE GOT A TEXT SAYING HE WAS IN 
THE STUDENT UNION WHICH WAS 
CLOSE TO US SO WE WERE NERVOUS 
AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE HE 
WASN'T GOING TO RUN INTO OUR 
BUILDING. 
>>> VLADIMIR PUTIN PARTICIPATED 
IN A LIGHTNING ROUND OF MIDDLE 
EAST DIPLOMACY FLYING TO THE 
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES TO DISCUSS 
THIS LEVEL WITH MOHAMMED BINNS 
THAT YOU NEED. 
TO SPEAK ABOUT SECURITY IN THE 
REGION. 
IT WAS NOT THE LAST MEETING 
WITH EBM MARATHI WHEN THE PAIR 
DISCUSSED THE ISRAEL AND HAMAS 
WAR. 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 
WHY DO THEY WANT STRONGER TIES 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST? 
>> IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE WITH 
YOU TONIGHT. 
FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE A FEW 
THINGS FIRST IT IS SYMBOLIC AND 
THAT IS THE DESIRE TO 
DEMONSTRATE THAT DESPITE THE 
SANCTIONS AND ALL THE BACKLASH, 
ALSO PRACTICALLY SPEAKING ONE 
WAS TO TALK TO KEY PARTNERS IN 
THE OIL CARTEL WITH THE STRESS 
AND STRAIN WITH REASONABLE 
PRICES OF OIL. 
DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON OIL PRICES 
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE 
SITUATION TO DEMONSTRATE THAT 
HE RATHER THAN THE UNITED 
STATES IS THE WORLD LEADER WHO 
CAN PERHAPS MEDIATE AND BRING 
AN END TO THE CONTRACT THERE. 
YOU CAN SEE THEY'VE CUT DOWN ON 
PRODUCTION LEVELS. 
>> DOES IRAN WANT RUSSIA 
INVOLVED? 
>> I THINK WITH THE IRANIANS, 
YOU HAVE THE MEETING OF THE 
MINDS. 
AND STRENGTHENING THEIR OWN 
ALLIANCE. 
I BELIEVE IT WOULD BRING CREDIT 
TO THEIR OWN POSITIONS. 
>> I THINK THAT THE U.S. IS IN 
A DIFFICULT SITUATION AS FAR AS 
THIS CONFLICT IS CONCERNED. 
AS THEY WERE MAKING THIS TRIP 
TO ABU DHABI AND RIYADH THERE 
ARE KEY ARAB AND ISLAMIC STATES 
MEETING WITH THE SENIOR 
OFFICIALS AND OTHERS. 
AS WELL AS ON THE HILL TO TRY 
TO TAKE THIS CASE FOR THE U.S. 
SUPPORT FOR CEASE-FIRE AND TO 
BEGIN THE ISSUE OF 
RECONSTRUCTION AND ADDRESS 
HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS. 
THERE IS THE SUPPORT THAT'S 
GOING TO PUT US SOMEWHAT AT 
ODDS WITH THEIR KEY ARAB AND 
ISLAMIC PARTNERS OF THE WORLD. 
AT THE CENTER OF THAT THE 
CONFLICT COULD COME TO AN END
