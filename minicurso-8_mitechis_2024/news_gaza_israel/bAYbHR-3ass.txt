during the final days of ramadan the
al-aqsa complex is normally only open to
muslims
but on sunday that changed
israeli forces entered the mosque and
escorted more than a thousand jews into
the compound
they danced and sang in front of the
al-aqsa mosque stores
for palestinians this was a provocation
the arrogance of the occupation they
want to police the settlers and to
forget our holy places and people
police had earlier announced the
compound will be close to non-muslims
but revoked the decision after hundreds
of religious israelis demanded access to
the site
many say letting them inside during
ramadan was a mistake
israel wants it to be a religious war
they are responsible for the violence
this is unprecedented aggression against
the worshipers

on sunday israelis marked jerusalem day
recognizing the country's capture of
east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967
six-day war despite the occupation of
east jerusalem not being internationally
recognized israelis see this day as the
unification of jerusalem
this is where israelis celebrate the
occupation of east jerusalem they will
march along the roads of the muslim
quarter inside the old city in order to
reach their final destination the
western wall every year the parade
creates instability inside the city
which is why israeli police say they
took extra precautions to prevent
clashes between israelis and local
palestinians
the al-aqsa compound is located on one
of the most contested religious sites in
the world
for muslims it is the third holiest
place
while for jews this is where the final
temple will be built
the last 10 days leading up to end of
ramadan are normally a time of
reflection
but this year is proving to be
particularly challenging
mustafa fatiho's tiarati world occupied
its jerusalem
