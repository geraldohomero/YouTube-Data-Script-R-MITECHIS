the nightmare in Gaza is more than a
humanitarian crisis it is a crisis of
humanity the intensifying conflict is
shaking the world rattling the region
and most tragically destroying so many
innocent
lives ground operations by the Israel
Defense Forces and continued bombardment
are hitting civilians hospitals refugee
camps mosques church and you enas
facilities including
shelters No One Is
Safe at the same time Hamas and other
militants use civilians as human Shields
and continue to launch rockets
indiscriminately towards
Israel I reiterate my utter condemnation
of the abhorent acts of Terror
perpetrated by Hamas on 7 October and
repeat my call for the immediate
unconditional and safe release of
hostages held in Gaza
nothing can justify the deliberate
torture killing injuring and kidnapping
of
civilians the protection of civilians
must be
Paramount I'm deeply concerned about
clear violations of international
humanitarian law that we are
witnessing let me be clear no party to
an armed conflict is above International
humanitarian
law ladies and Gentlemen of the
press Gaza is becoming a graveyard for
children hundreds of girls and boys are
reportedly being killed or injured every
day more journalists have reportedly
been killed over a 4-week period than in
any conflict in at least three
decades more United Nations Aid workers
have been killed than in any comparable
period in the history of our
organization I salute all those who
continue their life-saving work despite
the overwhelming challenges and
risks and the unfolding catastrophe
makes the need for a humanitarian
ceasefire more urgent with every passing
hour the United Nations and our partners
are launching a $1.2 billion US
humanitarian appeal to help 2.7 million
people that's the entire population of
the Gaza Strip and half a million
Palestinians in the West Bank including
East
Jerusalem
