OF ISRAEL'S TARGETED
ASSASSINATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING
US ONCE AGAIN, TONIGHT.
YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTING FOR THE
TIMES ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE
FAILURE CERTAINLY AT THE
BEGINNING OF WHAT IS NOW A WAR.
BEGINNING OF WHAT IS NOW A WAR.
HOW HAS THAT AFFECTED THE
RESPONSE SINCE ISRAEL BECAME
VERY MUCH AWARE OF WHAT WAS
GOING ON?
HAS IT SLOWED ISRAEL'S RESPONSE
SINCE THEY HAD A FAILURE OF
INTELLIGENCE AT THE BEGINNING?
DOES IT MAKE THEM RELUCTANT TO
TRUST THE INTELLIGENCE THEY
HAVE NOW?
>> THE EFFECT OF WHAT HAMAS HAS
DONE, ESPECIALLY --
GETTING ITS PERPETRATORS TO
CROSS THE BORDER, TO CRASH
DEFENSE AND CONQUER, FOR
SOMETIME, SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE OF
ISRAEL, PUT THE ISRAELI
MILITARY LEADERSHIP --
IT'S SOMETHING I COULD NOT
DESCRIBE READILY.
OTHERWISE --
THEY WERE CONFUSED, THEY DID
NOT TRUST THE --
EARLY ENOUGH.
PEOPLE GOT KILLED.
WE SAW NOTHING BUT SOME KIND OF
A FOG OF BATTLE COMING FROM
THAT PLACE.
BUT AS TIME PASSED, WE SEE THE
MILITARY REGROUPING, SENDING
THEIR FORCES, WHICH WE JUST
REPORTED ABOUT.
STARTING TO SHELL GAZA, FINDING
NEW VOCABULARY FOR THIS
SHELLING.
THEY WILL PAY A PRICE, THEY
WILL NEVER FORGET, THE WORDS
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU IS
USING.
THEY WILL NEVER FORGET OUR
RESPONSE.
THE WORLD WILL NEVER FORGET OUR
RESPONSE FOR THIS ATROCITY, I
THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE
GRAVITY OF THESE WORDS.
FROM CONFUSION, I THINK WITH
THE ISRAELI PUBLIC, AND ISRAELI
LEADERSHIP, AND THE SOLDIERS,
THOSE I MET BY GAZA YESTERDAY,
GOING FROM TOWN, TO DEVILISH
TOWN, TO DEVILISH TOWN.
YOU HEAR ANGER.
YOU HEAR FRUSTRATION.
YOU HEAR SADNESS.
AND YOU MAINLY HEAR
DETERMINATION.
IF JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, THE
COUNTRY WAS TORN BECAUSE THE
POLITICAL CRISIS, BECAUSE OF
THE LEADER --
NOW YOU SEE UNITY.
YOU SEE ONE COMMON ENEMY.
AND YOU SEE A COMMON GOAL,
WHICH IS TO PAY BACK, AND
PAYBACK HARD.
I THINK WE ARE, IF GROUND
INVASION IS DECLARED, AS
RICHARD SAID, THERE'S NOT A
CONCLUSION.
BUT SEEING THIS MASSIVE AIR
MANDATORY BUILDUP, NOTHING OF
ITS KIND IN THE HISTORY OF
ISRAEL.
WHEN YOU SEE IT, WHEN YOU
TRAVEL IN THE SOUTH, AND ALSO
THE NORTH, PREPARING FOR THE
POSSIBLE SECOND RUN.
