when nowhere feels safe in Gaza
Sheltering in hospitals the least worst
option for many of the
displaced doctors at alur's hospital in
Gaza City say there's no space left
untaken waiting rooms corridors inside
these Hospital Wards too taken by those
whose homes have been destroyed or those
too scared to
return this is a place to wait out the
war for however long they
can but the no place of Greater safety
here Israel's military has ordered
people to evacuate claiming that alud is
one of two hospitals with Hamas command
centers underneath the
building several families have told
reporters it's better to risk death in
hospital than on the streets some have
no choice the UN estimates around a
thousand patients in Garen hospitals are
on dialysis their lives dependent on the
backup generators reported to be running
low this is what the surrounding
neighborhood looks like now there have
been two strikes within 50 m of the
hospital since the Israeli evacuation
order we've been displaced from our
homes to the hospital the bombing
followed us all around the hospital the
director of the hospital received
threats from the IDF that he must
Evacuate the displaced where will we go
there are 15,000 displaced people in the
hospital we will die in the streets
if the bombings were so strong barrels
of explosives fell next to the towers
near us there are many buildings next to
the hospital there are so many children
here look they are 2 3 years old in the
southern city of Rafa this is the
aftermath of the latest air strike as
seen from above and the reality on the
ground this is where civilians were
asked to evacuate too the bomb reported
to have hit a local bakery killing and
injuring several people some of the
images too graphic to be
shown the UN says the scale of the human
tragedy unfolding is unbearable
