ATTACKING ISRAEL FOR, AND WHAT
HEZBOLLAH WOULD WANT TO ATTACK
ISRAEL FOR.
THE STATEMENT THAT CAME OUT
FROM THE U.S. IS VERY TELLING
AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS
ENOUGH, THEY SINGLED OUT THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS NOT
GOING TO ADVERSARIES AND
ENEMIES OF ISRAEL IS TO BE
CAREFUL, WHICH, FOR ME, SUGGEST
THAT ISRAEL IS EXTREMELY
NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED
TODAY.
THE FACT THAT ISRAEL HAS
SUFFERED THIS ATTACK --
>> IS THAT ABOUT IRAN?
LIKE, WHEN BIDEN SAYS --
>> YES I MEAN LOOK, THE HANDFUL
OF ENEMIES TO ISRAEL THAT
ISRAEL WOULD WORRY ABOUT IS
HEZBOLLAH ON THE NORTHERN
BORDER AND IRAN, BY PROXY, IN
PLACES LIKE SYRIA.
SYRIA GETS BOMBED ALMOST DAILY
BY THE ISRAELIS.
THE ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN --
>> IT'S A NON EVENT NOW WHAT
HAPPENS AND IT'S KIND OF SAD,
BUT AFTER SEEING THAT, THE
LOW-LEVEL NATURE OF THE
CONFLICT, IS THAT IT DOESN'T
GET REPORTED ON.
BUT ISRAEL CARRIES OUT STRIKES
ALL THE TIME INSIDE SYRIA.
NOT SO MUCH IN LEBANON, FOR A
WHOLE HOST OF REASONS, AND
HEZBOLLAH HAS MADE CLEAR THAT
IF YOU ATTACK US OR ATTACK
LEBANON, YOU ARE GOING TO WAR
WITH HEZBOLLAH.
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT IN
SYRIA, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR SYRIA.
YOU MAY TARGET OUR CONVOYS, OUR
WEAPONS AS THEY COME IN, BUT WE
WILL FIGHT THIS FIGHT WITH YOU
HERE ON THE BORDER, IF THAT
EVER ESCALATES.
AND IRAN HAS MADE CLEAR, YOU
CAN GO AFTER IRANIAN POSITIONS
INSIDE SYRIA, BUT THEY CAN'T GO
AFTER THEM IN IRAN, OR IF IT
DOES, THEY'RE GOING TO RESPOND
TO IT.
BUT THE POINT OF JUST KIND OF
DESCRIBING THAT FOR OUR VIEWERS
IS TO UNDERSTAND THE STATEMENT
THAT CAME OUT FROM THE U.S.,
WHICH IS, ISRAEL HAS SEEN
WHAT'S HAPPENED TODAY AND THERE
IS A MASSIVE CONCERN RIGHT NOW
THAT AND WESTERN INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES AND THE UNITED STATES,
AND IN EUROPEAN CAPITALS, ABOUT
WHERE IS YOUR GOES FROM HERE
