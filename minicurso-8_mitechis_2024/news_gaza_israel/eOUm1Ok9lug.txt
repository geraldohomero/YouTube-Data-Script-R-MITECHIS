>> Neil: UPDATED NEWS ON 
VIOLENCE INCIDENTS HAPPENING IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST RIGHT NOW.
JENNIFER GRIFFIN CAN UPDATE YOU 
ON THAT.
JENNIFER?
>> NEIL, WE JUST RECEIVED THIS 
BREAKING NEWS.
FOX NEWS CAN CONFIRM THAT OFF OF
THE COAST OF YEMEN, A U.S. MQ9 
REAPER DRONE WAS SHOT DOWN 
EARLIER TODAY.
A SENIOR U.S. DEFENSE OFFICIAL 
SAID IN A STATEMENT TO US 
MOMENTS AGO, WE CAN CONFIRM THAT
A REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT WAS 
SHOT DOWN WHILE IN INTERNATIONAL
AIRSPACE OVER INTERNATIONAL 
WATERS OFF OF THE COAST OF 
YEMEN.
ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE DEFENSE 
OFFICIALS WHO I SPOKE TO EARLIER
TODAY, THE MQ9 REAPER WAS 
CONDUCTING SURVEILLANCE OVER 
YEMEN WHEN A HOUTHI MALITIA 
LIKELY SHOT DOWN THE $32 MILLION
U.S. SURVEILLING DRONE.
THE HOUTHIS PUT OUT A VIDEO 
TODAY.
THE HOUTHIS LAST SHOT DOWN AN 
MQ9 REAPER JUNE 6, 2019.
THE REAPERS ARE FLOWN GENERALLY 
OUT OF U.S. AIR BASE IN JABUTI.
ON OCTOBER 19th, 2023, YOU'LL 
REMEMBER THAT THE USS CARNEY IN 
THE RED SEA SHOT DOWN 15 DRONES 
THAT WERE FIRED FROM YEMEN, FOUR
CRUISE MISSILES THAT WERE 
HEADING TOWARDS ISRAEL.
IF THOSE DRONES HAD LANDED, 
COULD HAVE ESCALATED THE 
CONFLICT.
IRAN HAS BACKED THE HOUTHIS IN 
YEMEN.
THEY'RE MQ9 REAPERS ARE USED TO 
SELECT INTELLIGENCE.
THEY CAN BE ARMED WITH EIGHT 
LASER GUIDED HELLFIRE MISSILES.
THEY USE SOPHISTICATED CAMERAS, 
SENSORS AND RADARS TO COLLECT 
INTELLIGENCE.
IT'S A HIGH POWERED CAMERA AND 
CAN DETECT HEAT AND OPERATE WITH
LITTLE TO NO LIGHT.
THEY CAN LOITER FOR 27 HOURS 
OVER 25,000 FEET.
NEIL?
>> Neil: THE HOUTHIS ARE 
FINANCED NOT JUST IN PART BY 
IRAN.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IRAN HAS BEEN BACKING THE 
HOUTHIS AS PART OF THAT CIVIL 
WAR IN YEMEN.
THE U.S. HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN 
YEMEN GOING AFTER AL-QUAIDA.
BUT NOW THE SURVEILLANCE DRONES 
IN THE AIR, THEY MOST LIKELY ARE
WATCHING TO SEE IF THE HOUTHIS 
ARE PLANNING IN ATTACKS OR 
FIRING ANY MISSILES TOWARDS 
ISRAEL BECAU
