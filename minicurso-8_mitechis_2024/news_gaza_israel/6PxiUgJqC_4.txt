To the United States there is Adriá
Saac because of the government of Joe Biden
supports the state of Israel in this
circumstance of war but at the same time
Ask for moderation, this has happened in the
Last hours Adrián good
NATURE How good afternoon Eduardo
And dear good team if in this case
It was the Secretary of Defense Lyd Austin
who asked good to communicate to the
Public opinion the request of the states
United for Israel moderate just
eh his operations in Gaza but about
Everything that stops an invasion of great
Gaza Strip scale that does not
occupy by land why because you have a
great fear that this huh can be the
scapegoat so that I will begin to
get directly involved in this
war conflict not not only
supporting Hezbollah eh but doing
intervene eh military personnel eh and a
send eh armament in a massive way huh
As to stop eh eh an invasion for
Land of Israel supported from the sea
for the United States not from the
aircraft carriers eh the government
of the United States eh now huh
This is lived with a level of interest of
What kind in the United States I say what
eh tapas eh are put with respect to
conflict
Israel yes looks is still the subject that
higher is on the agenda because also
directly impacts the image of the
President Joe Biden as always
we remember are playing eh your
re -election next year and the theme huh
of international relations is a
of the weakest subjects more
laziness one of the low notes of the
Biden Administration Bulletin by
What because let's say huh a situation of
war in which eh is involved
directly the United States as
It also happens with the conflict in
Ukraine with the invasion of Russia to
Ukraine good just alters the
predictability of the United States in
operations
economic also internally no
just directly affects the
Growth of the United States and that
affects the standard of living of the
people
