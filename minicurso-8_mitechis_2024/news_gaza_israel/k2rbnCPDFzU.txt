WEATHER TOMORROW. EVANS GOING TO
BREAK EVERYTHING DOWN FOR US.
GOOD MORNING. IT'S FINALLY
FRIDAY, APRIL 19TH I'M BRANDON
TODD AND I'M PAIGE ELLENBERGER
IN FOR LAUREN PRZYBYL. WELL
ISRAEL HIT BACK AT IRAN IN
RETALIATION FOR A STRIKE ON ITS
COUNTRY. FOX NEWS SOURCES
CONFIRM THE EXPLOSIONS TOOK
PLACE WHERE ONE OF IRAN'S
NUCLEAR FACILITIES IS LOCATED.
DAN GODWIN IS HERE WITH MORE ON
THIS DEVELOPING STORY. GOOD
MORNING DAN. GOOD MORNING PAIGE.
ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS THAT
ARISES FROM THIS ISRAELI STRIKE.
OF COURSE, WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
WILL IRAN RETALIATE? WILL THERE
BE AN ESCALATION IN U.S.
OFFICIALS SAY ISRAEL CONDUCTED A
LIMITED STRIKE ON THE IRANIAN
MORNING. ISFAHAN IS HOME TO A
MAJOR IRANIAN MILITARY AIRBASE,
AND IT'S WHERE ONE OF IRAN'S
NUCLEAR FACILITIES IS LOCATED.
IT'S SEEN AS A DIRECT RESPONSE
TO THIS. AFTER IRAN'S MASSIVE
ATTACK ON ISRAEL LAST SUNDAY
WITH THE FIRING OF MORE THAN 300
DRONES AND MISSILES, ISRAEL AND
ITS ALLIES INTERCEPTED 99% OF
THEM. NOW, ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR
AGO, US SECRETARY OF STATE
ANTHONY BLINKEN SPOKE IN ITALY,
WHERE HE'S ATTENDING THE G7
CONFERENCE OF MAJOR U.S.
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PARTNERS.
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE ISRAELI
STRIKE AGAINST IRAN. I'M NOT
GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT EXCEPT TO
SAY THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS
NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY
OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS, WHAT WE'RE
FOCUSED ON IS OUR WORK TO
DE-ESCALATE TENSIONS, TO
DE-ESCALATE FROM ANY POTENTIAL
CONFLICT. YOU SAW SECRETARY
BLINKEN ADDING THAT ISRAEL LAST
WEEKEND WAS ON THE RECEIVING END
OF WHAT HE CALLED AN
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK. AND HE
SAYS THE FOCUS OF THE US AND THE
G7 IS MAKING SURE ISRAEL CAN
ADEQUATELY DEFEND ITSELF. BUT HE
ALSO RETURNED TO THAT PHRASE
AGAIN OF DE-ESCALATING TENSIONS
IN THE MIDDLE EAST. PRESIDENT
BIDEN WILL DELIVER REMARKS IN DC
TODAY WITH UNION WORKERS. WE
WILL SEE IF HE HAS ANYTHING TO
SAY ABOUT THIS MORNING'S
