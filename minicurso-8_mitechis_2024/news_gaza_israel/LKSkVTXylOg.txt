lost a hero a brave son listen in
i think that india lost one of its best
heroes sons
but we also lost israel or israel-india
relation lost the champion
of the wonderful defense relations
between us because the general
was really
much appreciated in israel and was one
of the engines behind getting closer on
the defense side
uh you saw the reactions from israel
they came from the prime minister former
prime minister netanyahu minister of
foreign affairs minister of defense
chief of staff speaker of the parliament
as everyone uh i think that we
we are really really sad in this day
and you know also
it's part of our friendship and
brotherhood of the relations but it's
also part i guess in another layer of
the fact that israel is a country where
the military of the defense is extremely
important it's part of the nation it's
compulsory military service so everyone
goes to military so you know we have
more and more emotion also about this
side and about our military and
sensitive to militaries of others so
great loss
