the draft resolution has been adopted as
resolution
2728 in a rare break of decorum the
security Council chamber erupts into
Applause perhaps a sign of relief it was
moments after the council adopted a
long- awaited resolution for an
immediate Ramadan ceasefire in Gaza and
the expanded flow of humanitarian Aid
the vote was decisive 14 council members
voting in favor the US abstained
allowing the resolution to be adopted
the fighting must stop the killings must
stop the suffering and Collective
punishment must end after more than 5
months of a war of utter Terror and
destruction a ceasefire is the
difference between life and death for
the hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians and
others Riyad Mansour the Palestinian
Ambassador got emotional this must
signal the end of this assault of
atrocities against our
people a nation is being
murdered a nation is being
dispossessed a nation is being
displaced for decades now but never at
this scale since
theba the Israeli Ambassador said the
council is biased against his country to
this Council Israeli blood is
cheap this is a travesty and I'm
disgusted in the last few months the US
has vetoed three separate draft
resolutions demanding a ceasefire but
this time was different critically a
ceasefire and the release of hostages
will allow much more humanitarian Aid to
get into Gaza at a time when famine is
looming large when un security Council
resolutions are adopted they become
international law but during her remarks
the US ambassador made a curious and
surprising comment saying that the
resolution would be
non-binding after the vote when asked
about this a un spokesperson said that
the US appears to be wrong all the
resolutions of the security Council are
international law so uh so to that
extent uh they are as binding as
International lawers in a post on social
media un Secretary General said the
ceasefire resolution is long awaited and
called for it to be implemented saying
failure to do so would be
unforgivable Gabriel zando Al jazer at
