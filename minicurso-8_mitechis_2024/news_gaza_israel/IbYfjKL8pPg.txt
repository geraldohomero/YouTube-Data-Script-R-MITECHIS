>> I'VE GOT SOME BREAKING NEWS
TO SHARE WITH YOU AT THIS HOUR.
I WILL SHOW YOU FIRST A LIVE
SHOT IN NEW YORK CITY OF A
COURTHOUSE WHERE A GRAND JURY IN
MANHATTAN HAS BEEN MEETING FOR A
NUMBER OF DAYS.
BOTH THE NEW YORK TIMES AND CNN
ARE REPORTING THAT THAT GRAND
JURY HAS VOTED TO INDICT FORMER
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.
THAT WOULD OF COURSE BE THE
FIRST TIME IN U.S. HISTORY THAT
A CURRENT OR FORMER PRESIDENT
HAS FACED CRIMINAL CHARGES.
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
IN MANHATTAN HAS BEEN
INVESTIGATING THE FORMER
PRESIDENT FOR A WHILE IN
RELATION TO HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS
THAT WERE MADE TO A FORMER PORN
STAR BY THE NAME OF STORMY
DANIELS AND THE COVER-UP, THE
ALLEGED COVERUP THAT ENSUED
AFTER THAT.
THERE HAD BEEN RUMOURS FOR THE
PAST TWO WEEKS ACTUALLY BROUGHT
ON BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT
HIMSELF THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE
INDICTED BUT THE TIME CAME AND
WENT HE HAD SAID I THINK IT WAS
A TUESDAY A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT
IT WOULD HAPPEN.
IT NEVER DID MATERIALIZE.
WE DID KNOW, THOUGH, THROUGH
REPORTS -- LOTS OF AMERICAN
REPORTING THAT THE GRAND JURY
CONTINUED TO MEET, CONTINUED TO
HEAR FROM WITNESSES AND
CONTINUED TO DELIBERATE ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD INDICT
THE FORMER PRESIDENT.
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR WITH YOU
THAT CTV HAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY
CONFIRMED THE REPORTS COMING OUT
OF THE NEW YORK TIMES AND CNN,
BUT BOTH AMERICAN OUTLETS ARE
REPORTING THAT THE GRAND JURY
HAS VOTED TO INDICT FORMER
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP OVER
ALLEGATIONS THAT HE OR HIS
CONDUIT PAID A FORMER PORN STAR
HUSH MONEY AND THEN COVERED IT
UP.
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP TRACKING
BOTH THAT LIVE SHOT THAT YOU ARE
LOOKING AT ON YOUR SCREEN TO SEE
IF ANYTHING EMERGES OR ANYONE
EMERGES FROM THAT BUILDING.
WE'LL ALSO STAY ON TOP OF ANY
REACTION TO THIS NEWS AND OF
COURSE WE'LL TRY TO
INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM IT
OURSELVES.
I WILL BRING THAT YOU REACTION
AND ANY MORE DETAILS I GET A
