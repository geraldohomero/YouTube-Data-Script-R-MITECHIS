The end of military operations in Gaza
to the release of some 240 hostages
Detuse in particular by the Hamas interviewed
by an American channel first
Israeli minister evokes the possibility
an agreement to release some of his
hostages here is an extract from this
Exchange the Prime Minister y
Does he have a potential agreement he will be able to
to have one but I think I
speak more I will increase the chances that
It materializes and this is the result
Military pressure pressure
extraordinary work that does
the Israeli army which exercises a
pressure on Hamas leaders
This is the only thing that could create
An agreement and if an agreement is possible
Well we will talk about it when there
aura a us
will announce it here for this caution
which always dominates around the fate of
These hostages correspondence in Jerusalem
St√©phane
harmful an agreement that would bring
mainly on the elderly
even on young children held by
Hamas in Gaza Benam Nania by
military pressure certainly it is a
element that is likely to give way
Hamas to push it to an agreement
perhaps towards an exchange between these
Hostages and prisoners of Hamas
detained in Israel but there is also
obviously a diplomatic channel which is
open you know that Hamas is very
linked in particular to Qatar but also to
Iran and there would therefore be for
speak between Qatar and Hamas between
Qatar and the United States to obtain
a release of part of these
hostages therefore Israel of a certain
way play in both directions to
both in the military direction
and in the diplomatic direction for
obtain the release of these jotages because
You have to understand that there is a
extremely strong pressure from
Opinion There are posters everywhere
In the city there is every night at
hostage families television that
testify and who are demanding from Corp and Professor
the release of their hostages from their
relatives
