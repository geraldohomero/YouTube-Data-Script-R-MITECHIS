mentioned your concern about growth and
sovereignty
we're separated by only
a couple thousand kilometers of cold
water from uh highly militarized
potentially hostile neighborhood
and i think
the crimean experience would be a lot
harder to duplicate but not impossible
uh what can we do if a bunch of little
green men turn up and then decide that
they want to occupy a color or
calorie or something like that
but
so i guess let me start off by saying
that the
threat of that right now is very low
that's not to say it wouldn't change in
the decades uh in the future
we don't know um
so the other so
that's the first piece
you know that our
population density our infrastructure
density up there is
very low and one of the challenges
i guess one of the expressions of
sovereignty is being able to project
force to the extremities of your country
so if we have the ability to project
force to the extremities of our country
demonstrable capability
um
and and exercise that on a regular basis
that has deterrence of its own
and it changes the decision calculus of
anyone who may try to put little
agreement on
on one of our our honors up there and so
exercising that or developing the
ability to project uh force over those
distances let's face it those are
strategic distances being able to
operate once they're up there through
tactical mobility and having the
concepts to be able to do that concepts
and capability being able to sustain
ourselves being able to survive you know
let's basically the climate will be more
of a threat than the little green name
and then finally being able to address
the little green net uh monster up there
so answering those five questions with
any of our capabilities uh it's gonna be
important
