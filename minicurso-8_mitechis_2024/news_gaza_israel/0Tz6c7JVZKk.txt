we do know over 210 hostages are still
in the uh captivity of Hamas terrorists
and one of them is a young 16-year-old
teenager who has been kidnapped by Hamas
her father narrates this entire horror
let's have a
listen there was a lot of gunshots and
noise and scream screaming and it seems
like they're getting ready for battle
against the Army but the Army didn't
came and then after an hour and a half
two hours there was like a mob of people
coming from the Gaza
Street ER and more gunshots and more
yelling and then they broke the door of
my house and I heard many footsteps
inside the house and much viol inside
the house like breaking
walls and trying to break the metal door
of the safe
room ER but I held on the handle I
didn't let them
enter and uh after a while I heard a
fire now amid the escalating war between
Israel and Hamas Hamas has released two
more elderly women who were held captive
in Gaza foll in mediation from Qatar and
Egypt Hamas in a statement has said that
it has released the hostages on
humanitarian and health grounds the duo
named nit Cooper 80 and yed who's 85 in
fact the two women were kidnapped from
their homes in kibuts by Hamas on 7th of
October during the deadly strike against
Israel their husbands however are still
in hamas's captivity meanwhile the Hamas
leader has said that they will be
releasing hostages only if Israel stops
aggression and its air strikes but the
United States President Joe Biden talks
tough says that there will be no
ceasefire or talks until hostages are
fully released from hamas's
captivity will you let them go what
they
for
the US supporting the hostages for
