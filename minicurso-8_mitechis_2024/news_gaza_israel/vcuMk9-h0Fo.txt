ABOUT HOW FOUR CHILDREN SURVIVED
FOR MORE THAN A MONTH IN THE
AMAZON AFTER THE SMALL PLANE
THEY WERE ON CRASHED IN THE
JUNGLE.
HERE'S CTV'S HEATHER WRIGHT.
>> Reporter: FIRST THEY
SURVIVED A DEADLY PLANE CRASH
AND THEN SPENT 40 DAYS IN THE
AMAZON JUNGLE.
NEW VIDEO SHOWING THE MOMENT
FOUR YOUNG CHILDREN WERE
RESCUED.
THE SIBLINGS WERE EMACIATED BUT
ALIVE.
ON MAY 1st, A CESSNA
CARRYING THREE ADULTS AND THE
FOUR CHILDREN CRASHED IN THE
COLUMBIAN JUNGLE.
THE PILOT AND ANOTHER ADULT WERE
KILLED, BUT THE CHILDREN SAY
THEIR MOTHER LIVED FOR FOUR
DAYS.
BEFORE SHE DIED, THEIR MOM TOLD
THEM SOMETHING LIKE YOU GUYS GET
OUT OF HERE, THE FATHER OF TWO
OF THE CHILDREN SAYS.
ALL FOUR KIDS ARE INDIGENOUS AND
THEIR FAMILY SAYS TRADITIONAL
TEACHINGS HELPED THEM SURVIVE IN
A JUNGLE FULL OF SNAKES,
MOSQUITOS AND OTHER ANIMALS.
THEIR GRANDMOTHER SAYS THE
ELDEST, 13-YEAR-OLD LESLIE HAD
ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF HER
SIBLINGS, NINE, FOUR AND JUST 11
MONTHS.
THEY FOUND CASSAVA FLOWER FROM
THE WRECKAGE AND FORAGED FOR
FRUIT AND SEEDS KNOWING WHICH
WERE SAFE TO EAT.
140 SOLDIERS SEARCHED FOR WEEKS
ALONG WITH DOZENS OF VOLUNTEERS
FROM NEARBY INDIGENOUS TRIBES.
THEY EVENTUALLY FOUND THE CRASH
SITE BUT THE KIDS WERE GONE.
FOOTPRINTS, A SIPE CUP AND
LITTLE
LITTLE SHOES LEAD THE RESCUERS
TO THE CHILDREN AND WERE PULLED
TO SAFETY BY ROPES, THE JUNGLE
TOO DENSE FOR A HELICOPTER TO
LAND.
THE COMMANDER WHO HELPED FIND
THE KIDS HAS BEEN NAMED THE
BABY'S GODFATHER.
>> THAT IS TRUE.
IT'S AN HONOUR FOR ME TO BE A
GOOD FATHER.
I JUST ONLY HAVE ONE KID.
BUT FOR ME, I HAVE IN THIS
MOMENT TWO.
>> Reporter: THE CHILDREN WILL
SPEND SEVERAL WEEKS IN HOSPITAL.
THEY SPEAK LITTLE AND ARE WEAK,
BUT OFFICIALS SAY SOME OF THE
CHILDREN HAVE STARTED PLAYING
AGAIN, A HOPEFUL SIGN OF
RECOVERY AFTER 40 HARROWING DAYS
IN THE JUNGLE.
