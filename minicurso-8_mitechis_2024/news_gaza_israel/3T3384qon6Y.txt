Good thing Israel said concluded
His defense against accusations of
genocide on the second day of
Hearings before the International Court
of justice in the haa the legal team
Israelí strongly rejected the demand
presented by South Africa the defense
argued before the court that the
offensive in Gaza does not aim
the destruction of the Palestinians but the
protection of their own people in the
war against ever an organization that
Many countries consider
Terrorist now expanded the topic with
Adrián Krupnik Researcher of the
University of Tel Aviv Adrián which
They have been the key points in defense
from Israel before the Court
Good night before all
To remind the audience the
Convention on Genocide Data de
1948 is directly related to
The crimes committed by the Nazis who
They had the main target the people
Jewish and the definition of genocide
refers to acts committed with the
intention to destroy total or
partially to an ethnic national group
racial or religious what Israel is
carrying out and this was what
Exposed defense is the attack against a
terrorist group in this case never
that the defense highlighted is that the
accusation from South Africa lacked
of all kinds of evidence or witnesses in
this sense
Eh yes
Adrián if the court ordered the end of
the military operation in Gaza Israel lo
I would fulfill what I doubt the closure of the
Israeli defense closure was
warn about eh that political use
of the concept of genocide and court
International is instrumentalizing the
genocide and is using it to protect
To terrorist groups I doubt a lot
that Israel agrees a cease fire and
I'm almost sure I would have
Do the support of important nations
from the world like the United States and Germany
Thank you very much Adrián Krupnik
Researcher at the University of
Telavid thanks to
you
