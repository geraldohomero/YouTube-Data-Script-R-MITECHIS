for
today there is a heavy feeling in the
face of the loss we are at the stage
where large forces are operating in the
Gaza Strip making contact with the Enemy
the more we widen our operations the
more there are clashes and unfortunately
the more soldiers are
hit
of the State of
Palestine catastrophe
being
come
on
I want you to pass this along to the
last of the soldiers We are continuing
until the end until victory until Hamas
is annihilated let there be no doubt
about this this is important it is a
message I want to convey to every
Soldier over there I say this in the
face of great pain but also in the face
of international pressures nothing will
stop us we will go to the end to the
victory no less than that I thank you we
do it because of you through you with
God's help and with your
help
look people I can't describe this scene
jabalia Camp has completely drowned
there is a mar baby girl who died
inside the water flooded the tent I woke
up my seven-month-old child who was
soaking wet our house had been destroyed
my other child was muttered I don't have
any blankets or mattresses I took some
from my sister to cover my boy we just
one blanket between all of us five
people and only one blanket there are no
blankets no covers no mattresses no food
no water to drink living is difficult
and everything is expensive we cannot
buy anything to eat drink or anything
else our house was destroyed the child
was mared and I remained facing it all
this is the fifth place I had to move to
fleeing from one place to another with
nothing but a t-shirt
on we are soaked inside the tent I don't
know where to put my children water
flooded the tent I wrapped the children
in blankets and came here I don't know
what to do because of the rain or where
to
go
