>> Sandie: THE COUNT IS IN.
IT'S OFFICIAL.
INDIA HAS SURPASSED CHINA AS THE
WORLD'S MOST POPULOUS COUNTRY.
CHINA CAN BOAST 1.43 BILLION
PEOPLE AND TODAY JUST AS THE
U.N. PREDICTED, INDIA TOPPLED
THE LONG TIME CHAMPION BY ABOUT
THREE MILLION.
CTV'S JOHN VENNAVALLY-RAO
REPORTS.
>> Reporter: INDIA'S LONG BEEN
KNOWN AS A PLACE WITH A LOT OF
PEOPLE.
AT THE START OF THE CENTURY, ITS
POPULATION REACHED A BILLION.
AND SOME THINK THE LATEST
MILESTONE GIVES THE COUNTRY
BRAGGING RIGHTS.
>> INDIA IS HAVING THE GREATEST
YOUTH POPULATION.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE ENTIRE
WORLD TO GROW.
>> Reporter: ATTTHE U.N.,
OFFICIALS PROJECTING AS OF THIS
WEEKEND INDIA'S POPULATION WILL
HAVE REACHED JUST OVER
1.4 BILLION.
NOT ONLY MATCHING BUT OVERTAKING
CHINA WHICH HAS SEEN ITS BIRTH
RATE DECLINE FOR YEARS, EVEN
AFTER DITCHING ITS POLICY OF
ALLOWING PARENTS TO HAVE JUST
ONE CHILD.
>> PROJECTIONS INDICATE THAT THE
SIZE OF THE CHINESE POPULATION
COULD DROP BELOW ONE BILLION
BEFORE THE END OF THE CENTURY.
IN INDIA, BY CONTRAST, THE
POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE GROWING FOR SEVERAL
DECADES.
>> Reporter: IN FACT THE
U.N. NOW ESTIMATES INDIA'S
POPULATION WILL PEAK IN THE YEAR
2064 REACHING 1.7 BILLION.
AND ITS DECLARATION THAT THE
COUNTRY'S NOW THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST WHEN IT COMES TO A HEAD
COUNT IS A SPECIAL MOMENT FOR
INDIA WHICH SEES ITSELF AS A
RISING GLOBAL POWER.
[Speaking in Alternate 
Language]
SURPASSING CHINA'S POPULATION
GIVES US AN ADVANTAGE, SAYS THIS
MAN.
IF OUR YOUNG WORK HARD, IT WILL
STRENGTHEN INDIA'S ECONOMIC
SITUATION.
IN CHINA, THE GOVERNMENT
DOWNPLAYED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
THE MOMENT.
IT STILL HAS A LARGE QUALITY
WORK FORCE BUT IN INDIA, SOME
HOPING FOR THE KIND OF
DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND THAT LIFTED
CHINA OUT OF POVERTY.
>> SINCE WE HAVE A LOT OF
CONSUMERS, A LOT OF TALENT, IF
PEOPLE USE IT SMARTLY WE COULD
ACTUALLY OCCUPY A MUCH BETTER
PLACE IN THE WORLD THAN WE
CURRENTLY DO.
>> Reporter: STILL, SOME
QUESTION WHETHER INDIA CAN
REPEAT CHINA'S SUCCESS.
WITH THE COUNTRY GRAPPLING WITH
A WIDENING RELIGIOUS DIVIDE AND
CONCERNS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE,
WHILE OTHERS SEE INDIA ECLIPSING
CHINA'S POPULATION AS A POWERFUL
SYMBOLIC MOMENT.
