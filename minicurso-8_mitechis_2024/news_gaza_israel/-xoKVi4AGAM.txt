bashar kharyouti lives in a village of
3000 people in the occupied west bank
is surrounded by israeli settlements on
all sides and life there is difficult
their greed has become great
we are in a struggle to survive
we need to be steadfast
we must challenge the settlers and stop
the settlement
illegal settlements have multiplied in
the last few years with at least 600 000
israelis living in more than 200
settlements and outposts in the occupied
west bank and for decades israel has
provided a dual legal system
it is the law that consolidates the
system of apartheid it is a law for
israelis who are living illegally in the
occupied palestinian territories while
palestinians who are originally living
here are subjected to another law a
military law
for settlers living up there on that
hill israeli law means that they enjoy
all the rights and services of an
israeli citizen living in israel even
though they are here in the occupied
west bank meanwhile the palestinians who
live here under israeli military rule
are denied many basic rights the
settlers even get more water than the
palestinians who live on the opposite
hill
there were five springs in karut
they seized the three of them and turned
the area into tourist resorts
now they want to seize the remaining two
springs that forces us to buy water from
the nearby settlement
the association for civil rights in
israel objects to the dual legal system
saying the renewal of the law
perpetuates a state of systematic
discrimination further compounding the
ongoing violations of the human rights
of palestinians in the west bank
the law however hit an obstacle in the
israeli parliament the coalition
government failed to pass an extinction
of israel illegal protections to
settlers
now the coalition faces a vote of no
confidence and israel is headed towards
the fifth election in little more than
three years
[Applause]
the settler's law will automatically
renew it for six months until the next
government is formed muhammad al-qasem
