 
>>> THE U.S. LAUNCHES A SERIES 
OF NEW AIRSTRIKES IN YEMEN. 
CENTRAL COMMAND SAYS IT CARRIED 
OUT SIX STRIKES DESTROYING AN 
UNMANNED UNDERWATER VESSEL AND 
18 ANTISHIP VESSELS. 
A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE YEMEN 
GOVERNMENT SAYS THE STRIKES 
KILLED 11 AND INJURED 14. 
CBS NEWS HAS NOT VERIFIED THOSE 
FIGURES. 
>>> THE FIRST AID SHIP CARRYING 
200 TONS OF FOOD DEPARTED 
CYPRUS FOR GAZA AS PART OF A 
PILOT PROJECT TO OPEN UP A NEW 
SEA ROUTE FOR MUCH-NEEDED 
EIGHT. 
JOINING ME WITH MORE ON THIS 
FROM THE BBC, WHAT MORE CAN YOU 
TELL US ABOUT THIS SHIPMENT? 
>> IT HAS BEEN A FEW HOURS 
SINCE THE OPEN ARMS SHIP SET 
OFF IN CYPRUS. 
IT HAS 200 TONS OF AID, MOSTLY 
FOOD, FLOUR AND RICE, CANS OF 
TUNA. 
IT IS PROVIDED BY THE CHARITY 
WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN. 
A SPANISH CHARITY IS INVOLVED 
AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. 
WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS 
THIS MARKS THE OPENING OF A NEW 
MARITIME ROUTE, ANNOUNCED THE 
LAST WEEK TO GET NEEDED AID 
INTO GAZA. 
IN THE NEXT DAY AND A HALF WHEN 
THE SHIP ARRIVES WE SHOULD FIND 
OUT LOGISTICALLY HOW THIS ROUTE 
IS GOING TO START TO OPERATE. 
YOU HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION 
INVOLVED, THE UNITED STATES 
INVOLVED, YOU HAVE THE UK AND 
THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND 
OTHERS THAT ARE ALL WORKING ON 
THIS. 
OF COURSE PRESIDENT BIDEN DID 
SAY THE U.S. MILITARY WILL SET 
UP A TEMPORARY PIER OFF THE 
COAST OF GAZA TO ALLOW THE 
DELIVERY OF FUTURE EIGHT. 
WE UNDERSTAND THE DELAY FROM 
THIS VESSEL IS THE FACT THAT IT 
TOOK A COUPLE DAYS TO SET UP A 
TEMPORARY JETTY THAT THEY WILL 
USE IN THE MEANTIME TAKING 60 
DAYS FOR THE MILITARY TO GET 
THERE TO SET UP ITS OPERATIONS. 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
INTERNATIONAL FRUSTRATION ABOUT 
THE VERY SLOW FLOW OF AID GOING 
INTO GAZA. 
THERE WAS A UN MORNING ABOUT 
MASS FAMINE WITH REPORTS FROM 
LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS OF 25 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED AS A 
RESULT OF STARVATION. 
THIS MARITIME ROUTE IS 
IMPORTANT, BUT THE UN SAYS THEY 
ARE GETTING MORE
