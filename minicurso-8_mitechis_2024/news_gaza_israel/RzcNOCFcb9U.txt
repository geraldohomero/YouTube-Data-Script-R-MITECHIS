and have no money to buy any blankets or
mattresses or even clothes for the
children we escaped from the
bombardments We Came Here We were

shelter but we found them all full of
people so we had to buy these plastic
sheets and wood to make a tent to save
us from the cold these families and
thousands others like them have been
displaced into these thin tents after
Israeli war planes bombed their homes
they have no blankets no warm clothes or
anything to survive the
cold this used to be a United Nations

overcrowded with the tents of those
displaced these areas are what Israel
calls safe shelters and and orders
evacuees to go
to there's no cooking gas entering Gaza
after Israel imposed a full blockade at
the beginning of this
war so many here are forced to cook
using firewood some have even made their
own ovens to bake their
bread I bring firewood from the bush and
burn it so that we can bake for
ourselves and for others in order to
live and help people survive we also
made this oven from the iron sheets so
that we can cook and bake food in
it these displaced families are dealing
