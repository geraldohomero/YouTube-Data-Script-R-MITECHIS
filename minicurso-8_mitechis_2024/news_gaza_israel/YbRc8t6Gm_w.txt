>>> WELCOME BACK.
>>> WELCOME BACK.
IF IT IS TUESDAY, VOTERS ARE
VOTING SOMEWHERE.
HOSTING THE HOUSE AND SENATE
PRIMARY.
WE ARE NOT EXPECTING TOO MANY
SURPRISES.
BOTH REPUBLICAN DAVE McCORMICK
AND BOB CASEY FACING
UNCONTESTED PRIMARIES.
THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST
CLOSELY WATCHED RACES SINCE
NOVEMBER.
MODERATE REPUBLICAN -- FACING A
MODERATE REPUBLICAN -- FACING A
CHALLENGE. THIS STATE COULD
VERY WELL BE IN PLAY.
OVER IN PITTSBURGH, FACING A
PRIMARY LARGELY OVER HER
POSITION.
HE IS A MEMBER OF THE
PROGRESSIVE SQUADRON, AND ONE
OF THE FIRST LAWMAKERS TO CALL
FOR A CEASE-FIRE.
I WANT TO TURN OUT TO NBC'S ALI
VITALI  WAS ON THE GROUND WITH
THE LATEST.
YOU SPENT SOME TIME IN
PITTSBURGH.
SO WHAT DID YOU HEAR FROM THEM?
>> YES.
A REALLY FASCINATING MOMENT.
THIS IS AN ISSUE WE TALK A LOT
ABOUT IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS.
ACTUALLY, SHE DOES VOTERS --
SHE JUST VOTED ON THAT PACKAGE.
LEE VOTED AGAINST THAT.
I ASKED HER, WHY?
>> IT HAS BEEN CALLING FOR A
CEASE-FIRE.
THE ROAD IS LOOKING AT THE WAY
THIS IS BEING CONDUCTED.
EVEN WITH THE 9 BILLION.
>> WHAT WE ARE HEARING IS THAT
THE HUMANITARIAN AID IS GETTING
IN.
>> IT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO
SEND BOMBS TO ISRAEL.
WE NEED TO STOP THE BOMBING,
STOP THE BLEEDING, BEFORE WE
CAN EVEN DO ANYTHING ELSE.
>> Reporter: AND LOOK,
CERTAINLY SHE IS NOT THE ONLY
DEMOCRAT WHO VOTED AGAINST THE
ISRAEL A PIECE ABOUT THAT
PACKAGE.
OTHER DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE TO GO
HOME AND TELL THEIR VOTERS WHY
THEY MADE THAT VOTE.
THIS HISTORICALLY JEWISH
COMMUNITY, THEY HAD THE
NEIGHBORHOOD HERE.
IT ALSO HAD TO TREE OF LIFE
SYNAGOGUE.
IN JUST 2018, SAW A GUNMAN CAME
IN IN A HATE CRIME AND KILL 11
PEOPLE IN A SHOOTING HERE.
IT IS CERTAINLY NOT FAR FROM
MEMORY AND SOMETHING THAT
VOTERS WILL LIKELY THINK ABOUT
WHEN THEY GO TO THE BALLOT BOX.
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALSO
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE WAY THEY
ARE PLAYING IN THE MINDS OF
VOTERS IN AN AREA WHERE IT IS
PLAYED OUT.
THEY WERE FACING A PRIMARY
ANYWAY BEFORE THIS.
THIS IS GAVE HER OPPONENT MORE
REASON TO CHALLENGE HER.
>> NOT FROM SUMMER LEE.
>> NOT FROM SUMMER LEE.
I MADE SURE TO ASK THAT
QUESTION.
SHE TELLS ME SHE WILL COMMIT
THOSE WHO VOTE THAT WAY.
>>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, A LOT
