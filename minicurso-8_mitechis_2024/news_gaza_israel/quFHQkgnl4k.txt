NOW GROWING ABOUT HOW POWERFUL
THAT GROUP REALLY IS.
MATT BRADLEY REPORTS FROM
SOUTHERN LEBANON.
[SOUND OF GUNFIRE]
>> Reporter: HERE IN SOUTHERN
LEBANON, THE RHYTHM OF WAR.
HEZBOLLAH IS BURYING YET
ANOTHER OF THEIR FIGHTERS.
>> IT IS HARD TO LOSE SOMEBODY
WE LIKE.
SOMEBODY THAT WILL BE GONE
FOREVER.
>> Reporter: STILL, THEY CAME
IN HUNDREDS, THIS SMALL
COMMUNITY UNITED IN GRIEF AND
THEORY, CHANTING DEATH TO
ISRAEL.
AND DEATH TO AMERICA.
THIS IS A CELEBRATION FOR THE
YOUNG AND THE EVEN YOUNGER.
THE FAMILY MEMBERS SAY THEY DID
NOT KNOW HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE
GROUP.
>> WE KNOW HIM AS A GUY, VERY
NICE, WELL BEHAVED.
VERY NICE.
PEOPLE LIKED HIM VERY WELL.
>> Reporter: HIS DEATH IS THE
LATE NEST A STRING OF LOSSES
FOR HEZBOLLAH.
THEY SAID THEY LOST A DOZEN MEN
IN THE PAST 24 HOURS, 37
MILITANTS DIED IN MORE THAN TWO
WEEKS OF SMALL SCALE FIGHTING.
ISRAEL LOST ONLY 7.
>> ANOTHER DAY.
THE GROUP IS HEMORRHAGING MEN
AND THE WAR HAS NOT BEGUN.
>> Reporter: EVER SINCE HAMAS
LAUNCHED THE BLOODY ATTACKS TWO
WEEKS AGO.
HEZBOLLAH ISSUED THEMSELVES AS A
DETERRENT.
IT IS UNCLEAR IF THIS AXIS WILL
TAKE ACTION, IF IT DOES IF IT
WILL HAVE THE STRENGTH.
MEETING LEADERS FROM THE AXIS
OF RESISTANCE RELEASING THERE
PHOTO HOD REELS ABOUT LEADERS
OF HAMAS.
IF THESE GROUPS SUFFER LOSSES
LIKE HEZBOLLAH DOES TODAY, THE
DEATH TOLL CAN BE CATASTROPHIC.
DEATH TOLL CAN BE CATASTROPHIC.
>> I MENTIONED THE HEAD OF
HEZBOLLAH.
HE HAS BEEN ABSENT.
NORMALLY HE IS IN THE EYE OF
THE PUBLIC.
BUT NOW, IT HAS BEEN THREE
WEEKS, WE HEARD FROM EVERY
LEADER ADDRESSING THIS TOPIC
BUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HIM.
THAT IS REMARKABLE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
