this is the house of horror where
members of a British family were killed
and kidnapped by hamus Fighters bathroom
was completely wrecked glass
everywhere the tragic events took place
last week here in the beer kibuts where
more than 100 people were
killed
each of those little puffs of
smoke is where one of the Iron Dome
missiles successfully intercepted a
rocket that was heading our
way even now there's Rockets coming over
from Gaza and it's more than a week on
from the horrors that unfolded right
here on this very leafy
street it's almost too awful too
contemplate but in many of these homes
along
here after the gun battles people would
be locking themselves away in their safe
rooms secure
rooms and the Hamas gunman simply Set
Fire to the house escaping from
here was hell these are the cars parked
just
outside the British family's
house the mother Leanne from Bristol was
killed here in her home along with one
of her daughters yahel who was only 13
years
old this is an upturned barbecue in the
front
garden four bullets that was breakfast
or maybe last night's meal not cleared
away and now just chaos panic
this looks like the Panic Room with its
secure metal
door there are blood stains all over the
floor the bathroom's completely wrecked
glass
everywhere the father Eli is still still
missing along with their oldest daughter
Noya
16 they are believed to have been
abducted by the hamus militants and
taken to
Gaza the family is clinging to the hope
that they might still come
home as this family come to terms with
this horror yah's Uncle Sharon says she
was a lovely sweet interesting helpful
funny girl who loved nothing more than
to be around other
