look I don't pretend to be in charge of
the foreign policy of the US I have
enough with the foreign policy of the
European Union but let's be
logical how many times have you heard
the most prominent leaders and foreign
minister around the world saying too
many people are being
killed President Biden said this is too
much on the
top is not
proportional well if you believe that
too many people are being killed
maybe you should provide less
arms in order to prevent so many people
being
killed it's not
logical and in
2006 in the war against Lebanon the US
already took this
decision they already took the decision
oppose the supply of arms to Israel
because Israel didn't want to stop the
war exactly the same thing that happens
today and everybody goes to T beg him
please don't do that protect civilians
don't kill so
many how many is too
many which is the
standard but Netanyahu doesn't listen
anyone they're going to
evacuate where to the
Moon where are they going to evacuate
these
people so the International Community
believes that this is and a Slaughter
that too many people are being killed
maybe they have to think about the
provision of arms and by the way today a
court in Netherlands has said has
ordered to the government to stop
exporting the spare parts of the F-35
fighters to Israel in order to be sure
that the international court of justice
rule is being implemented so I don't
know every member state is a owner of
his foreign policy but this a little bit
contradictory to continue saying that
there are too many people being killed
too many people being killed please take
care of people please don't kill so
many stop saying
please and doing
something
