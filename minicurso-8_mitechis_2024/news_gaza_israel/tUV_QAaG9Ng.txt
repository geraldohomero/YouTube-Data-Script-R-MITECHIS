in the palestinian village of frasin in
the occupied west bank it's hard to
build a life because it's hard to build
a home so ahmedo marne and his family
took a different
approach two years ago we decided to
build a house in the village but when
the israeli authorities didn't allow it
we started to live in a cave then the
israeli authorities suddenly came to the
cave and said it was forbidden to live
here they also said if the cave was not
vacated within a few days it will also
be destroyed
ahmed and his family aren't the first to
get eviction notices amarne's cave house
is located in area c of the occupied
west bank which was divided up into
areas a b and c in the 1995 oslo accords
as part of negotiations for a two-state
solution
but 25 years later there's been little
progress and israel maintains military
and civil control of area c
allowing 125 illegal settlements to be
built there with plans for more
it routinely destroys palestinian homes
and prevents them from building on their
own land
we understand that they do not want us
to live here there is racial
discrimination here the jewish settlers
living in the neighborhood are provided
with all kinds of requirements such as
protection communication electricity and
water
at a time when ahmed's family is looking
to their future
the prospect of being able to build in
their own village is bleak
and as israeli settlements grow more and
more palestinian villages are denied
the resources is close to both a
residential area called hawa tallnaf and
haramesh settlement therefore demolition
warnings were sent to the whole village
to displace the residents we have been
attacked and our farmland has been
seized
with no way to stop the destruction of
all that he's built ahmed's struggle to
find his family a home will have to
continue
