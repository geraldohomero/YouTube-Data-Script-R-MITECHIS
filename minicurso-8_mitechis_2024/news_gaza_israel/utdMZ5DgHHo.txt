Two news at this time important
sanctions to Iran FT says that
Iran's oil exports are going to
have work with sanctions reach
its maximum in 6 years 6 years while
West prepares sanctions the increase
of sales of
Raw
China exposes the limits of attempts
of the United States and Europe of
control the Islamic Republic
We collide with the same stone
You think you are in a world where you can
put sanctions and there is no
problem and you have first
Atiborran just what you have mounted
With Israel
Now reaching its maximum in 6 years 1.5
Millions of oil daily barrels
sanctions could reduce medium
Million seems easy for a million starts
complicated would leave him half a million if
They leave him half a million in his pocket in
sense of sale money
But what is the diversion of your decision
We have known in Russia the detour from your
Decision is that they do not even
tickle is that the and a half million
barrels that are already pulling or yes in
Mira Pum Pum Mira Did
Pum does not affect and say China China
China Risi does not say chin pin raichi eh
chi million and a half at what price we
you want and what Europe and say then
we put a stop and the Iranians know
They laugh
They are in an economic policy
different more similar to that of a
prewar environment more similar to a
cold war environment that to the environment of
Free trade in which I impose you
sanctions by the way that he has said
United States who loves them
return to Venezuela for what we return
at a tension escalation around
sanctions which do not usually end very
well normally especially looking at
Russia because what Venezuela will do and
He will tell him
yes here you have more oil and and China
saying what you wanted transition
Energy continue with her that here
I'm clear then come the
sanctions but now we have the context
that Financial Times puts it to us come
sanctions in a maximum environment
6 years in exports of
Iran oil and with the price above
Eh why let's see if the sanctions
Russia format leave or leave another
way as Russia China forms come out to
Clean laughing rachi loud
clean and collaterally Putin saying
I showed you the way
