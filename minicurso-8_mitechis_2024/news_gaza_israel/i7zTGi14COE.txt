it was a first at the united nations
a moroccan ambassador celebrating
hanukkah with his israeli counterpart
morocco is one of four arab nations to
re-establish diplomatic relations with
israel
the deal was brokered by the united
states
for decades the prevailing assumption
was that the world would only see
normally
normalized international relations with
israel
following a resolution of the
israeli-palestinian dispute
but we have proven this assumption wrong
while the us took credit in the security
council
outgoing middle east special coordinator
nikolai maladenov
noted the situation has gone from bad to
worse for most palestinians
despite an eight-month pause in the
building of illegal jewish settlements
in the occupied territories
israel's destruction of palestinian
homes for lacking permits that are
rarely granted
escalated by 70 percent with plans to
build in
areas seen as crucial to a future
palestinian state
advancing i do believe in the two-state
solution
and although every day we see the chance
of
its realization shrinking i do believe
that it is still possible
and it is possible in a way that it
recognizes the legitimate historic
rights of both israelis and palestinians
alike
in exchange for morocco normalizing ties
with israel
the united states recognized morocco's
sovereignty over the western sahara
region
and separatists there with whom the
united nations had also been engaging in
peace negotiations
many here in the international community
see these unilateral moves by the united
states
as undermining long-standing norms and
international agreements
it was four years ago that the security
council passed resolution 2334
calling settlement expansion a flagrant
violation of international law
what was significant about it was that
it was the first one in almost 10 years
to do so
the first one since 1980 to talk about
settlements
and the fact that in the united states
which usually vetoes
such resolutions abstained and that's
what was significant about it but there
was nothing controversial or new
in the actual resolution while
president-elect joe biden has promised a
return to international agreements
many living under occupation have to
wonder what difference
if any at all it will make for them
