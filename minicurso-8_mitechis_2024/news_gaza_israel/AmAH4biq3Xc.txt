>> THANK YOU LOIS.
>> UKRAINIAN FORCES HAVE BEEN
ACCUSED BY RUSSIA OF KILLING THE
DAUGHTER OF A NATIONALIST.
PAUL, TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT
RUSSIA IS SAYING.
THEY ARE ACCUSING SPECIAL
SERVICES OF UKRAINE OF KILLING
THE DAUGHTER OF PRUDENCE BRAIN.
>> AMAZINGLY, THE RUSSIAN
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES SOLVED
THIS CRIME WITHIN ABOUT 24 TO 48
HOURS.
VERY STRONG POLICE WORK.
AND, OF COURSE,, THEY NOW COME
UP WITH THIS ANSWER THAT IT WAS
A UKRAINIAN INTELLIGENCE UNIT
THAT WENT INTO THE SUBURB VERY
CLOSE TO MOSCOW, DEEP INSIDE
RUSSIAN TERRITORY AND PLANTED A
BOMB IN A CAR THAT KILLED THIS
YOUNG WOMAN.
SHE IS OF COURSE IT IS A
ULTRANATIONALIST AND HER FATHER
IS A WELL-KNOWN ULTRANATIONALIST
IN RUSSIA WHO IS PUSHED PRUDENT
TO GO FURTHER WITH THE WAR IN
UKRAINE.
-- PUSHED THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN.
THE ANNOUNCE OF CHARGES OR BEING
ABLE TO SOLVE IT ARE QUITE
SUSPICIOUS.
I THANK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF
PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT BELIEVE THAT
UKRAINE WOULD RISK GOING THAT
DEEPLY INTO RUSSIA TO CARRY OUT
THE BOMBING AND ALSO TO KILL
SOMEONE WHO IS REALLY NOT VERY
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF PRUDENCE
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS AND
INFLUENCERS.
>> Marcia: WHAT ARE WE HEARING
OF UKRAINE?
>> UKRAINE DENIES THAT HAD
ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH IT.
THAT SEEMS FAR MORE BELIEVABLE.
WHY UKRAINE WOULD RISK THE WHOLE
UNIT TO GO INTO RUSSIA THAT DEEP
TO TAKE OUT SOMEONE THAT REALLY
HASN'T HAD A HUGE EFFECT ON THE
WAR.
IT IS VERY MYSTERIOUS, NO ONE
SEEMS TO KNOW.
IT COULD BE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE
UNIT WAS ACCUSED ITSELF MANY
YEARS AGO PLANTING BOMBS, A
SERIES OF BOMBS IN RUSSIA.
THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE FIRSTLY
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND NOT
VERY CONVINCED OF THE STORIES WE
ARE HEARING.
>> ALSO THERE IS A SUSPECT WHO
ESCAPED TO ESTONIA AFTER THE
EXPLOSION.
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT?
>> THAT IS INTERESTING.
OF COURSE THE RUSSIANS OR SAYING
THIS UKRAINIAN WOMAN WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR GUIDING THIS
ATTACK.
SHE THEN ESCAPES TODAY OR
YESTERDAY TO A NEARBY ESTONIA.
THE RUSSIANS OR NOW SAYING LOOK,
THAT COULD BE VARIOUS SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES IF YOU DON'T ARREST
THAT PERSON AND CENTRE BACK BACK
TO RUSSIA.
OF COURSE,, ESTONIA IS ONE OF
THE STRONGEST NATIONS IN
RESISTING MOSCOW AND ITS WAR IN
UKRAINE.
AGAIN, I REALLY VERY FASCINATING
MIXTURE OF INTRIGUE AND
SUSP
