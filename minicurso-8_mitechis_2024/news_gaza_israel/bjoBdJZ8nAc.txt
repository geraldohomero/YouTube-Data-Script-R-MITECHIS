As expected in Israel Benjamin
Net Nego The Premier is designing is
finalizing if you want the details of
What is going to be the land incursion
This final offensive according to what
They have planned the final offensive of
Israeli army in Rafá the south of the
Gaza Strip We are going to share the
following report that will allow us
getting out a little more to this
situation
bombings on Rafa seen from
Israel the Israeli government has been
announcing a great land incursion
At the moment the prime minister
Benjamín Netanyahu has not softened his
Posture we will complete the elimination of
The never also in Rafa not
There will be anything that
Stop but after months of war
Israel now faces strong
PRESERES ALIADA UNITED STATES WASHINGTON
He has urged him to stop the
military operations and leave your plan
of a large -scale invasion in Rafá
where more than one million people live
in conditions
precarious we make Israel clear that
a large -scale military invasion in
Rafa would have an effect greatly
harmful to civilians and that in
last instance would damage the security of
Israel Israel affirms land dear to
Large scale would have to end
Never an invasion of this type
It would probably be similar to what
It has happened in other parts of Gaza in
urban areas such as Yan Yunis and the city
from gaza north of
rafá an air campaign combined with
tanks and troops on the ground
would have catastrophic consequences for
Israel civilian population has said that
will evacuate civilians to other places
from Gaza but but it has not given details
concrete this type of invasion
land would perhaps cause a
distancing by states
United who has conditioned his support
military in the future to the way in which
Israel treats civilians in Gaza but
Israel has also carried out
selective operations successfully
beginning of this month the commands
They recovered the body of the At Katzir
that had been taken as reem on
October these incursions are based on
Intelligence information requires more
that in a military power
The path that Israel chosen
may depend on politics in states
United President Joe Biden
faces important pressures from the
left to stop the government
Israeli while in his country Benjamí
Netanyahu faces an opinion
public that you want mostly
defeat
