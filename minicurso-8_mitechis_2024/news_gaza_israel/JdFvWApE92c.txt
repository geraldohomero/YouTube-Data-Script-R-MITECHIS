okay
I know it's difficult 27 have different
approaches but we have to work together
with the Arab
world I know it's difficult but it's our
moral Endeavor our moral obligation to
try to do our utmost to try to look for
a solution so from now on please talk
about the two- State solution
process
[Music]
be
fore
for we have to discuss even if they
don't disagree even they disagree they
have to come here and they will discuss
with us and we'll study which other
solution they have in mind which are the
other solution they have in
mind to make all the Palestinians live
to kill of them 25,000 already in Gaza
70% of women and
childr certainly the way of trying to
destroy Hamas is not the way they're
doing because they are seeding the hate
for
Generations we have in mind what Hamas
is what Hamas has done and certainly we
reget and we condemn but the peace and
stability cannot be built only by
military means and not in this
particular way of using military means I
say that with a full respect to the
victims of of Hamas
