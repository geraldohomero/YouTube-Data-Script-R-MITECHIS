as Israel makes it clear that it will
continue invading Hamas Egypt on
Saturday called a peace Summit for
negotiations between Israel and Gaza
here's all you need to
know Egypt's President Abdul fat LCC
organized a summit calling for an end to
the
war on agenda was humanitarian Aid to
Gaza ceasefire negotiations and the
resumption of Israel Palestine peace
talks in attendance were the prime
ministers of Iraq Italy Spain Greece and
Canada and the president of the European
Council however no consensus has been
reached
for
UK has called for the Israeli military
to exercise restraint in
Gaza I'm sure we all share the revulsion
at hamas's murderous acts of terrorism
the targeting of the uh civilians the
murdering of children the desecration of
dead bodies and I'm sure we are all
distressed by the plight of Palestinian
civilians in Gaza whose lives have been
made made harder more painful and more
dangerous because of the brutal attacks
by Hamas on the 7th of
October and we all mourn the dead both
Israeli and
Palestinian raising concerns the Italian
Premier asserted war must not become a
much wider
conflict
Def
for
turkey rallied its support behind
Palestine Israel should be urged that
the temporary so-called victories did
not bring long-term Security in the
course of history it will not bring this
time too Israel exploits the solidarity
of some countries as an open check for
unleashing a blind rage on Palestinians
such a Rage which even targets mosques
and
hospitals on the other hand I would like
to remind that unconditional military
aid to Israel or csing Regional
countries to unrealistic and
unsustainable plans serve nothing but
deepening
occupation and Palestine has called for
a United Nations Peace Summit in
Cairo
