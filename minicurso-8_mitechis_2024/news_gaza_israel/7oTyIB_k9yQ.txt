for
don't send the signal that the
Palestinian lives don't matter
don't dare say Israel is not responsible
for the bombs it is dropping over their
heads don't justify the
killings don't blame the victim and I
repeat don't don't do that they said
they would cut water electricity Fuel
and food for millions of
Palestinians and did so in an inhumane
and unlawful Collective punishment as
bombs were destroying every remaining
aspect of life in the Gaza Strip Israel
has no right to force them to choose
between force displacement or
death or subject them to
both nowhere in nowhere is safe in
Gaza
for unfortunately Russia 's resolution
presented today does not meet all of
these
responsibilities Russia's resolution put
forward without any consultations make
no mention of Hamas none by failing to
condemn Hamas Russia is giving cover to
a terrorist group that brutalizes
innocent civilians we will continue to
urge our Israeli Partners to work to
minimize the risk of Civilian casualties
the first step this Council must take
before any calls for Aid before any
calls for Aid calm or restraint is to
designate Hamas as the murderous Terror
organization that it is just as the
council did with Isis and Al-Qaeda
secondly and no less important this
Council must support Israel's right to
defend itself but supporting this right
does doesn't mean echoing empty words it
means standing in solidarity with Israel
in our rescue mission to obliterate
hamas's ter capabilities if Hamas is not
obliterated such such atrocities will be
repeated and not only in
