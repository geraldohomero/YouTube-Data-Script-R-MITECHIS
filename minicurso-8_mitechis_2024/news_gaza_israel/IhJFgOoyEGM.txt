NEED TO FOCUS ON NATIONAL
SECURITY FOR OURSELVES AND FOR
OUR FRIENDS AND START THINKING
ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO
GET AMERICA STRONG AGAIN.
>> I WANT TO DRILL DOWN
YESTERDAY.
YESTERDAY ALMOST ALL OF YOUR
REPUBLICAN RIVALS BLAMED THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AS WE
DISCUSSED WITH THE SECRETARY
CITING THE DEAL THEY MADE WITH I
RAIN.
YOU JUST SAW THE SECRETARY OF
STATE EFFECTIVELY SAY THERE IS
NO LINK BETWEEN THAT DEAL AND
THE HORRIFIC ATTACKS THAT
UNFOLDED YESTERDAY.
DO YOU THINK IT WAS
IRRESPONSIBLE OF YOUR RIVALS TO
LEVEL THAT ALLEGATION WITHOUT
ANY EVIDENCE OR PROOF?
>> I ACTUALLY THINK IT WAS
IRRESPONSIBLE FOR SECRETARY
BLINKEN TO SAY THAT THE $6
BILLION DOESN'T WEIGH IN HERE.
BE HONEST WITH THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE AND UNDERSTAND THAT HAMAS
KNOWS AND IRAN KNOWS THEY'RE
MOVING MONEY AROUND AS WE SPEAK
BECAUSE THEY KNOW $6 BILLION
WILL BE RELEASED.
THAT'S THE REALITY.
WHEN I WAS AT THE UNITED NATIONS
YOU SAW WHEN THOSE PLANES SENT
BY OBAMA TO IRANI WENT TO THE
ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY, I MET WITH
THEM AND THOSE FUNDS WERE SENT
TO HEZBOLLAH AND LEBANON.
THEY WERE SENT TO GAZA AND THE
HOUTHIS AND YEMEN.
THEY SPREAD TERRORISM EVERY TIME
THEY GET A DOLLAR.
IT DOESN'T GO TO THE IRANIAN
PEOPLE AND IT DOES GO TO
TERRORIST ATTACKS AND SECRETARY
BLINKEN IS NOT TO IMPLY IT ISN'T
MOVED AS WE SPEAK TO --
>> IT WAS HOURS AFTER THE
IMMEDIATE ATTACK.
IS IT IRRESPONSIBLE TO LEVEL
THAT CHARGE WHEN YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT
AT THIS POINT IN TIME?
>> THE EVIDENCE IS LOOK AT WHAT
THE IRANIAN PEOPLE HAVE DONE TO
FREEDOM-LOVING PEOPLE AROUND THE
WORLD.
LOOK AT WHAT THE IRANIAN PEOPLE,
THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS DONE TO
THREATEN ISRAEL OVER THE YEARS,
TO THINK THAT THEY'RE NOT MOVING
MONEY AROUND IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO
SAY THAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THEY ARE MOVING MONEY AROUND TO
THREATEN THOSE THEY HATE.
THEY HATE ISRAEL.
THEY HATE AMERICA.
THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
USE THIS.
IT WAS WRONG TO RELEASE THE $6
BILLION, BUT LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT ELSE WAS WRONG.
IT WAS WRONG TO HAVE THAT
DEBACLE IN AFGHANISTAN.
IT WAS WRONG TO WAIVE SANCTIONS
ON IRAN TO GIVE THEM MORE MONEY.
MONEY HAS BEEN FLOWING TO IRAN
