I really don't know it's a miracle it's
a miracle miracle because people who
were next to me did not get out alive
with a bullet in her leg and shrapnel in
her stomach 27 year-old mikal Ohana
considers herself one of the lucky ones
but when rocket siren sounded at the a
music festival in southern Israel and
Hamas militants began killing and
kidnapping hundreds of Festival goers
M's fate was far from
sealed it was just shooting rain
shooting whoever that could run ran and
then others got killed after bullets
pierced the windows of the car she and
her boyfriend were trying to escape in
mikal soon found refuge in a small shed
crammed in with at least 50 other
people there already people who were
injured some in their legs some in their
backside some in their heads I had a
scarf on me and somebody next to me was
bleeding so I gave her a tourniquet on
her
leg minutes later shots rang out
res there was silence for a few minutes
and the policewoman who was there with
us simply
screamed whoever wanted to be alive
needs to leave now those who could leave
left those who couldn't
I don't know what happened with them
mikal and her boyfriend took off running
but mikal panicked as her legs buckled
her boyfriend dragged her across the
ground and managed to shove her into the
window of a passing vehicle but at every
turn more Hamas
Fighters they just went with white
pickup trucks on each pickup truck there
were at least 20 terrorists with
Kalashnikov grenade guns shotguns
machine guns
I've never seen anything like this in my
life seemingly in circled M once again
jumped out of the car and began running
before finding an abandoned army tank on
the side of the road the bullets reached
her there too hiding under the tank
mikal was shot in the leg and shrapnel
from a grenade pierced her
stomach and in that time we didn't see
we couldn't see anything and they were
taken some people were
taken
for six more hours mikal lay lying
underneath that tank until Israeli
soldiers rescued her and evacuated her
to hadasa hospital where she was one of
more than 60 victims treated I do my and
I think I going to die you thought you
were going to die
yeah
