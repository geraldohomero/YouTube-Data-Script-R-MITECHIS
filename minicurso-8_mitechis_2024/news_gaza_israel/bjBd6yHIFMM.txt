is
for over 10 days now you have witnessed
it killing entire families bomb
shelters schools hospitals residential
buildings
convoys you have heard it telling people
to he South to head south of Gaza and
then bomb
the
South it is beyond belief that some
still speak of a right to
self-defense of an occupying power that
has made clear it is seeking blind
Vengeance forced transfer and
annihilation of our
people Mr a political disaster is
underway and yet the security Council of
the United Nations is unable to say the
only thing that truly
matters stop the
Bloodshed I repeat stop the
Bloodshed for those who think they can
avert a humanitarian catastrophe and a
regional spell over while Israel continu
continues bombing and killing
Palestinian Ians think
again the region is united in telling
you it is not possible listen to them
the only way to prevent both is to stop
this criminal aggression against our
people
president there is no right killing more
Palestinians will never never make
Israel more secure 75 years years of
experience should have been proof enough
for those who want to learn so far this
Council has not even condemned Hamas for
the atrocity it perpetrated let alone
held Hamas fully responsible for the
situation in Gaza but here we are
discussing humanitarian
corridors does nobody else see how
ludicrous this
is calling for calm restraint TR and
ceasefires is like putting a Band-Aid on
a bullet wound such steps will not
eradicate the cancer that is Hamas
humanitarian corridors will not prevent
the next atrocity the only thing that
will is the utter obliteration of this
satanic
entity what are you doing to prevent
this
evil I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as the representative of Brazil
we demand an apology an
apology the UN and some of on this
Council rush to adopt the lies of Isis
likee terrorists and refuse to accept
the hard evidence of a law-abiding
democracy you should
apologize apologize for never convening
the council when Hamas Rockets are fired
deliberately deliberately at Israeli
Hospital
hospitals Zai Hospital in Ashkelon was
directed was directly hit by a Hamas
Rockets just last week where was the
council apologize for years of putting
your heads in the ground while Hamas
ceaselessly build up its War Machine in
