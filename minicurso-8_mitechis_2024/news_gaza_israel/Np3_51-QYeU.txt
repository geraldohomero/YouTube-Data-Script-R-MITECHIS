people have been injured especially in
The esplanade of the mosques in a shock
between Palestinians and Israeli forces that
Custody this area is a day
especially conflictive about commemoration
of the Jerusalem Day in which the Israelis
They celebrate the occupation of the eastern part
of that city and also coincides with the month
Sacred Muslim from Ramad√°n the incidents
They started throughout the weekend and
worsened with the passing of the hours of fact the
Moment of greatest tension was when they started
To sound the sirens this morning is a holy
warning in an air attack, it was about
seven missiles launched from the strip of
gaza for the Hamas group because so I know

Only one of them managed to be intercepted
For the anti-MISIL shield with which it counts
Israel we hear parts of that tense moment
And we saw the missiles and look how the
situation now what happens that they have
7 hours more than we are also
records during the night they are already living

The Air Force would be escalation of violence

in Gaza in response of what happened during
The day the esplanade of the mosques

From Jerusalem is the old city or in the city
walled where are the sacred places
or saints of the three monotheistic religions
