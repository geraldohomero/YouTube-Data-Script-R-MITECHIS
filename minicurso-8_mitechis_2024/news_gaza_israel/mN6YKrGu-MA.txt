Israel Hamas War recently
I felt that Israeli inside the gaz
The army is constantly weakening there
Hamas on the other hand is the Israeli army with full force
Was responding to and with which the goal
She entered the Israeli army gaz
The goal was not seen to be fulfilled, yes
Despite causing heavy havoc in the gaz
Israeli army is not eliminated from Hamas
Humas has been able to do upside down with full force
Israeli is attacking the army but
In the midst of all this, the Israeli army took such action
Has done so that the whole of Hamas woke up
Ismail, head of political bureau
Hanaye who exiled and Qatar's capital
Living in Doha but their family
Was in the gaz and now Israeli Defense Force
An aerial attack and their three sons and
Three ships have killed IDF Male
Hania's three sons Hajan Aamir Mohammed
And his grandchildren Amal Khalid and Raja were killed
According to media reports, Hanian
All three sons Refugee Camp of Western Gaza
Eid riding in a car from Alshita
Going to meet your relatives on the spot
Were but then IDF has an air on them
Attacked in which all of them died
On the other hand when Hamas chief Ismail
Loss this received news of the death of his sons
So he became very emotional and he
Said that we with this pain and blood
For your purpose and your nation
Hope to create future and freedom
My sons martyrs the biggest
Has acquired respect and respectable death
Sons of our people in son Gaza Strip
Stayed with and he did not leave Gaza
All our people in the bandage and each
Family with the blood of their children
Palestine paid heavy price for Palestinian conflict
And I am one of them around 60
Relatives martyred him and others

Palestinism
Our connectivity towards more strong
Hanaye further said that enemies
Murders of demolition and massacre
He has failed to meet the goal
Achieve this goal from the conversation also
We will not be able to free Aluku and Alksha
Neither stagger your way to get it done
Gay nor behind
[music]
Hania will also make it clear that
No surrender in front of Hamas Israel
Will do that the country that surrenders
We are not able to achieve peace
Will compromise it nor give up
Whatever we do for this
[music]
Lying
