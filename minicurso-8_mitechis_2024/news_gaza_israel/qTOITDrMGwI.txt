The truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza
is therefore extended by 2 days it is
First what the Qatar announced is
then confirmed by Hamas and Israel
This truce was normally ending
Tomorrow morning we go right away
telavive find our special envoy
Karim yayaoui karim which are your
all the latest
info then it is clear that this truce
seems to be confirmed since the house
Blanche explained that Hamas and
Israel was agreeing to try to
continue this truce for a few
days maybe days is just
semi-surfers since yesterday we had
heard Benjamin Netaniaou explain
in front of his war cabinet that he
was going to do everything to continue and
defeat Hamas but that it left the
open door to other liberations and
therefore therefore to a possible
Truck a senior Hamas official
Since Lebanon has also confirmed
this hypothesis and therefore this truce
could continue when we are at the 4th
day of these releases and that for
the moment the hostages that must be
released today have not yet
returned to Israeli soil Qatar played
once again an important role in
this extension if it is confirmed
It will undoubtedly be confirmed when
Israeli hostages will be reduced to
Bonport Le Qatar who stressed that there
also had a number of
difficulties inside the strip of
Gaza that not all hostages were
in the hands of Hamas that a certain
many of them would seem
in the hands of Islamic jihad the
Hamas who stressed that these hostages
could represent about forty
of people and therefore
Represent 4 days of truce
additional but for the moment we n
is not yet there and for families
Uh in this place where I am
They are used to being in
Face of the army headquarters
Israeli for families it is a
new reason for hope to see new
new releases in the hours
but also in the coming days
Thank you Karim Karim Yayou Special Envoy
in Israel
