well back to one of our top stories the
violence between Israelis and
Palestinians chercher is the deputy head
of the Israel national security council
and he joins me live from Tel Aviv
welcome to the program un
secretary-general ban ki-moon is
expected to meet with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem
and with Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah is
his visit going to have any effect on
the rising violence
we have to bless any initiative to bring
more piece to this region and I hope
that the contribution of
UN Secretary Ban ki-moon will help
to reach a kind of calm but of course it
depends mainly on the Palestinian side
that is behind the current round of
violence and what about the sign that
the two sides can reach an agreement
they've been heavy losses on both sides
any chance of seeing decreases intention
I
think that the main problem of the
violence in these days that it's done by
individuals who are influenced by false
propaganda a
claiming that Israel is trying to change
the status quo in Alex Allah which is of
course not true and I think that Prime
Minister Netanyahu said it more than
once very clearly that Israel has no
intention to change the status quo in
the holy places so the main
reason and maybe the main source to to
read the column is to stop the hostile
propaganda that make the motivation for
this younger individuals to carry out
terror attacks against Israeli civilians
now some of accused Israel of using
excessive force and security measures
against Palestine attackers is that is
that a fair statement I
think that the Israel has to do all it
can to protect Israeli citizens I think
that both the IDF and the police are
trying to prevent the attacks and to
save lives and they try to use a minimum
force
in this very complicated
confrontation okay sure say we'll leave
it there thank you
