FAMILY AGAIN. HIS KIDS WERE
GREAT. WE'RE HERE AT YYC THIS
AFTERNOON. BIG GRIPPED HIM
TIGHTLY IN A TEARFUL HUG JUST A
FEW DAYS AFTER THE CALGARIAN
ARRIVED IN GAZA TO VISIT HIS
PARENTS AND SIBLING. THE WAR
BROKE OUT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
HAMAS. IT WAS ACTUALLY THE
FIRST TIME IN 7 YEARS THAT HE
HAD RETURNED TO GAZA AND HE
MADE THE TRIP PRIMARILY BECAUSE
HIS MOTHER IS SICK. THE 43
YEAR-OLD SAID THAT THEY
CONSTANTLY HEAR THAT THEY WOULD
BE KILLED BY BOMBS. AND HIS
FRIENDS SAY THAT DOZENS OF HIS
EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE
BEEN KILLED SINCE THAT WAR
BEGAN IN OCTOBER THIS SAID THAT
HE HAD SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS
HIMSELF, INCLUDING WHEN BOMBS
HIDDEN NEIGHBOUR'S HOME AND A
BAKERY WHILE HE WAS OUTSIDE IN
LINE WAITING TO BUY TUESDAY
SARAH WAS FINALLY ABLE TO
ESCAPE THROUGH THE RAFAH BORDER
IN EGYPT TODAY, 367 CANADIANS
PERMANENT RESIDENTS AND THEIR
ELIGIBLE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE
ESCAPED THAT WAY. WHEN THIS
YEAR DID ARRIVE, THEY ASKED
WHERE HIS MOTHER WAS, BUT IT
WASN'T COMMUNICATED THAT HE
COULD ACTUALLY BRING HIS
PARENTS. SO NOW THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET HIS PARENTS ACROSS.
>> SAFETY HERE. BUT WHAT ABOUT
MY FAMILY IS NOT SAFETY.
NO ONE IS NOT SIFTING. GOES TO.
>> THAT IS SO GOOD RIGHT NOW
AND HAPPY. BUT ALSO WE DON'T
HAVE TO FORGET ABOUT OUR
FAMILIES THERE. AND THE
CEASEFIRE IS THAT HAPPENING.
AND NO ONE BUILDING. I KNOW
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT WE NEED
TO HOLD. I HEAR. SO HAVE PM
LIFE. I JUST MISS HIM A LOT.
>> THOUGH HE'S HAPPY TO BE
HOME, HE CANNOT SHAKE THE
DEATHS IN THE DEVASTATION THAT
HE WITNESSED. HE WORRIES FOR
HIS FAMI
