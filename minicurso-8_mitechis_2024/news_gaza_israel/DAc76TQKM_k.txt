now we advise our viewers to use
discretion as some might find the
information
distressing in a move to Ghana support
in response of the humus attack Benjamin
netanyahu's office took an extraordinary
step to release shocking and gruesome
images of babies murdered during the
attack the post on social media platform
X formerly known as Twitter the prime
minister's office shared the horrifying
photos of the babies burned and in a
pool of blood brutally murdered now the
photos have been shared with a warning
from the
authorities in the post they referred to
the Hamas group as monsters and inhuman
now we at weon have decided not to show
these images the move came after some
media organizations heavily criticized
Israel on some of its claims regarding
the acts of barbarity carried out by the
Hamas militant group The spokesperson
for the the prime minister's office in a
statement mentioned the justification
behind sharing these images he said
these distressing visuals aim to evoke a
strong reaction and generate Global
outrage against Hamas the pmo showed
these to US Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin and NATO defense ministers in a
closed door meeting on Thursday after
which they were released on social media
Anthony blinkin condemned the ACT
so uh we did see uh photographs videos
that the U Israeli government shared
with
us uh some I think is actually already
been seen uh in um uh public media
others were were new to me and I think
uh new to our
team it's hard to find the right
words
it's beyond what anyone
would ever want to imagine much less
actually see and God forbid
experience a baby an
infant riddled with
bullets soldiers
beheaded young people burned
alive in their cars or in their Hideway
rooms I could go on
but it's
simply depravity in the worst imaginable
way meanwhile Netanyahu has vowed to
annihilate Hamas following its deadly
assault on unsuspecting Israeli
communities on Saturday which killed
more than
1,300 people the deadliest attack by
Palestinian militants since Israel was
founded in
1948
