i'm in the village of borodianka 40
kilometers northwest of kiev population
here 12 000 that was before the russian
invasion now they're trying to count the
dead they believe more civilians died
here than in anywhere in the region
see that behind me you see the gap that
used to be one big building and when
russian forces
bombed it and they bombed many other
apartment buildings well it trapped the
residents who were hiding in the
basement
and so now they're trying to
recover the bodies anywhere from a few
dozen to a few hundred they simply don't
know there are families who are waiting
who have been waiting for days for any
sign
that loved ones could be found in the
meantime whatever has made it um look at
this
i mean there are family photos that have
been found just outside and people have
been leaving them
hoping
somebody will recognize them
somebody will find them
one older couple i spoke to they've been
waiting five days here for their son
they last spoke to him on april 1st
they said that they called him and he
said hello and then the line just cut
and they've been calling every day since
and nothing
one woman told me that she lives nearby
and
when russian forces arrived she says she
recognized the chechen accent
she was so terrified
knowing their reputation she was
terrified for her 16 year old daughter
that she hid her
in the sofa
in the basement and this went on for
days
i want to show you
this is what it looks like from here
see these are these are family and
friends
who are waiting
and sometimes when things go quiet
usually it's because the workers think
they may have found someone
and so they go slowly
this here is the town square
and this
is a statue of terrace
who is ukraine
as well
best known poet
he fought for ukrainian independence
he was left here
and if you can see it
he was left here
with a bullet
to the head
