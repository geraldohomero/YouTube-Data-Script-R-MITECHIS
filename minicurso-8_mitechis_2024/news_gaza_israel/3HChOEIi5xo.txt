>>> UKRAINE IS BEING BLAMED FOR 
A FIRE AT A DEPOT IN RUSSIA.
PAUL, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
THIS ATTACK ON RUSSIA?
>> THE RUSSIANS ARE SAYING THAT 
IT PROBABLY ADDS TENSION TO 
PEACE TALKS.
I THINK WE NEED PERSPECTIVE, ONE
ATTACK ON AN OIL DEPOT THAT 
DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY IS HARDLY 
COMPARES TO THE MILLIONS WHO 
HAVE SUFFERED IN UKRAINE SINCE 
THE RUSSIANS INVADED.
IT WAS A VERY DARING ATTACK BY 
THE UKRANIAN AIRFORCE, TWO 
HELICOPTERS WE UNDERSTAND, 
ATTACK HELICOPTERS FLEW LOW OVER
THE BORDER, FIRED MISSILES AT A 
FUEL DEPOT AND TOOK IT OUT.
UKRAINE HASN'T CONFIRMED THEY 
DID IT BUT IT'S OBVIOUS HERE. 
>>> IT'S MORE OR LESS SYMBOLIC, 
REALLY, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE 
RUSSIANS SAID A WEEK AGO THAT 
THEY HAD PRETTY MUCH DESTROYED 
THE UKRANIAN AIRFORCE, WELL, 
THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T, I THINK 
IT WILL BE A MORALE BOOSTER FOR 
THIS COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY THE 
MILITARY FORCES IN UKRAINE. 
>>> WE'RE ALSO HEARING REPORTS 
OF RUSSIAN TROOPS LEAVING THE 
CHORNOBYL SITE BECAUSE OF 
CONTAMINATION FROM NUCLEAR 
WASTE.
CAN YOU TELL US ANYMORE ABOUT 
THAT AND WORD ON WHERE THEY'RE 
GOING?
>>> THESE REPORTS HAVE BEEN 
CONFIRMED, I THINK, THAT THE 
RUSSIANS WHO TOOK OVER THE 
CHORNOBYL SITE FIVE WEEKS AGO 
HAVE GIVEN IT BACK TO THE 
UKRAINIANS TO RUN.
THEY HAVE LEFT OR ARE IN THE 
PROCESS OF LEAVING HEADING NORTH
TO BELARUS, NO DOUBT AND THERE 
HAVE BEEN THE UKRAINIANS ARE 
SAYING THE RUSSIANS, SOME OF THE
RUSSIAN SOLDIERS MAY HAVE BEEN 
CONTAMINATED, HAD SUFFERED CASES
OF RADIATION POISONING BECAUSE 
OF THE TIME THERE. 
>>> THAT'S NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY
ANYBODY. 
>>> AND THE HEAD OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC AGENCY 
ANNOUNCED HE'S GOING TO GO TO 
CHORNOBYL AS SOON AS HE CAN AND 
WITH A MISSION OF SOME KIND, 
PERHAPS WE'LL KNOW THEN IF THE 
STORIES ABOUT CONTAMINATION ARE 
TRUE. 
>>> YOU MENTIONED THE 
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN UKRAINE AND
RUSSIA BACK ON TODAY.
WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING OUT OF 
THOSE?
>> PROBABLY NOT VERY MUCH TODAY.
THEY'RE MOVING IN SMALLER STEPS.
UKRAINE MADE IMPORTANT 
CONCESSIONS, THEY DECLARED 
NEUTRALITY IN EXCHANGE FOR 
INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES AND 
THEY'LL TALK TO RUSSIA ABOUT THE
AMOUNT OF TERRITORY THEY COULD 
KEEP.
THERE'S SOME MOVEMENT AVAILABLE 
HERE IF RUSSIA WANTS TO TAKE IT 
UNLESS THEY WANT MORE TERRITORY 
BEFORE THEY AGREE TO A 
CEASE-FIRE AND TO REAL TALKS
