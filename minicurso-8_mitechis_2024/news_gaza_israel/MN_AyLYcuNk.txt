SHORT LEASH TO POTENTIALLY
DEPLOY.
>> EXCELLENT REPORTING.
>> EXCELLENT REPORTING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
LET'S GO OUTSIDE THE WHITE
HOUSE ON THE DIPLOMATIC ASPECT.
A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF
REPORTING FROM YOU THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS CONSIDERING TRAVEL
TO ISRAEL, PERHAPS AS EARLY AS
THIS WEEK.
WE KNOW HE WAS INVITED BY THE
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER AS A
SHOW OF SOLIDARITY.
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.
WHEN YOU THINK OF THE SECURITY
APPARATUS THAT COMES WITH A
PRESIDENTIAL MOVEMENT
DOMESTICALLY, LET ALONE
INTERNATIONALLY, LET ALONE TO
AN AREA IN AN ACTIVE WAR ZONE,
YOU KNOW WHAT GOES INTO
MOVEMENTS LIKE THAT.
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE
PLANNING AND PREPARATION GOING
PLANNING AND PREPARATION GOING
INTO THESE TALKS AS THE WHITE
HOUSE CONSIDERS THIS MOVEMENT
TO ISRAEL, AND POTENTIALLY, WE
COULD SEE THE PRESIDENT GO TO
OTHER AREAS OF THIS REGION.
WE KNOW THAT U.S. OFFICIALS, AS
WELL AS THE PRESIDENT, HAVE
BEEN IN TALKS WITH OTHER
FOREIGN LEADERS.
THE PRESIDENT WILL SPEAKING
WITH THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT
TODAY.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WILL ALSO
HAPPEN.
WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL THE
UNKNOWNS IN THIS REGION, THE
ISRAEL COUNTEROFFENSIVE AGAINST
GAZA STILL CONSIDERED IMMINENT.
WE KNOW THAT ISRAEL IS STILL
TAKING ON ATTACKS FROM THE
NORTH FROM HEZBOLLAH IN
LEBANON.
LEBANON.
WE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW
POTENTIALLY CHAOTIC THE OPENING
OF THE BORDER CROSSING WOULD
BE.
WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THESE
UNKNOWNS INTO CONSIDERATION A
FACTOR THAT INTO THE DECISION-
MAKING FROM WHITE HOUSE
OFFICIALS, YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE
HOW DIFFICULT THE PLANNING AND
HOW DIFFICULT THE PLANNING AND
PREPARATION WOULD BE FOR THIS.
YOU THINK A PRESIDENTIAL VISITS
TO WAR ZONES BEFORE.
IT TOOK A MONTH BEFORE WE SAW
PRESIDENT BIDEN GO TO POLAND,
NOT EVEN UKRAINE, AFTER RUSSIA
INVADED UKRAINE.
AFTER THAT, HE TOOK THE VERY
SECRETIVE TRAINRIDE INTO
UKRAINE.
NO DOUBT, WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS
ARE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THE
SECURITY CONDITIONS ON THE
GROUND FOR THIS TRIP.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE
SEEING IS THE SECRETARY OF
STATE MEETING WITH THE ISRAELI
. THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR
ABOUT FOUR HOURS.
