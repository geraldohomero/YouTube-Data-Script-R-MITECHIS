Tom can you tell us what Emily is like
as a
person um
yeah laughing smiling giggling
active
uh dancing all day long singing all day
long um going out with their friends
very sociable very
social
um yeah a a big hole in her
heart now you spent 3 weeks thinking
that she was dead and then came the
moment when you were told that she was
mostly likely not dead and had been
taken hostage can you tell us about the
moment you heard that news and how you
reacted uh yeah from from all the
evidence that they they have and all the
evidence that they don't have um she's
in she's alive and in in Gaza
and how did it make you feel when you
were told
that uh obviously very shocked a
complete reversal of how you think about
Emily you know one minute she's dead
next minute she's
alive uh takes a lot of
adjusting
um okay you know the initial knowing
that thinking that she was dead is is
traumatic enough in itself but then to
have to completely flip your head upside
down to find out she's alive is
uh it's very hard to do it it took at
least a day to really let it sink in
and
adjust if you were able to get a message
to the people holding Emily captive what
would that message
be
[Music]
um show show the world
that you're not
evil just let Emily
go
um bring her bring her home to her
dad let her have her 9th
birthday with family and
friends have have passion have
mercy show the world that you have got
Mercy you've mentioned a birthday and
just just over a week's time is Emily's
ninth birthday if we're still in the
same position and she's still captive
will you be marking that day at all in
anyway no we we we'll wait until she
comes home and then then we'll throw a
massive
party uh yeah it won't just be her all
her little friends from school and the
the the kots
