let's go live now to the spokesperson
for the woman's boat to gaza mission
Ellen who to Hanson great to have you
with us first things first how is
everyone on board the boy doing
well we haven't had contact with anyone
on the boat since approximately 4 p.m.
central european time
but the last
message we got was that everyone was
doing fine and
preparing calmly to
reach Gaza or face the
interception and Ellen obviously we just
heard they're from a correspondent on
the ground in Ashdod at the port in
Israel that Israel is merely following
protocol here what do you make of it and
then redirecting the vessel
well we
disagree obviously this is an illegal
action from the
IDF and
the blockade is completely legal and
against
international law and it's also against
international law to intercept about on
international waters so we
we hope that people around the world
will take a stand against this and put
pressure on Israel to end a blockade
than to
to bring our activists safely to edge
dodge and Ellen as you said you have not
had communication with the people on
that vessel for six hours now you knew
that this would happen so why put 13
woman women on a boat with thousands of
dollars worth of supplies that could
have reached Gaza through other means is
there a chance you're being a little
reckless here
first of all we don't have any supplies
on the boats and we don't have carry any
AIDS we only carry nonviolent peace
activists and a message of hope and
solidarity and
the point that we're trying to make is
that we want to point the eyes of the
world towards this
the situation for the Palestinians in
Gaza and we will continue to do so until
change has been made and until the
blockade is lifted well you are so much
doing you are doing a very good job of
getting the world media's attention on
this right now Ellen who through Hansen
thank you so much for joining us
