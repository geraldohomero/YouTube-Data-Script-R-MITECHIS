From this morning the Israeli army
an operation is carrying out
large -scale military in Yening that
It could last several days and what is
unpublished because almost 20 years ago that
Israel did not attacked the hood by air and
by land with such violence in these
Last two weeks just after the raid
Israeli who killed seven Palestinians
There was the suspicion of a great operation
Due to the claim of members
Government ultra -rightist and also
of settlers' leaders despite the
Own Netanyahu government is
avoiding name to this attack and
He has struggled to clarify that this does not
is against the Palestinian authority but a
operational to break terrorism
As he calls it from the different
Palestinian militias of the camp of
filling refugees hitting their
Operations center however they are
multiple dead and wounded not
Only militia the Israeli army has
deployed to more than 1000 soldiers
including combat troops and members
of intelligence that are discovered and
to bombarded drones carrying out
selective murders something like
We anticipated did not happen since the end of
the second intifada in parallel to the
armed clashes that follow between
The army and the Palestinian militias
Palestinian red crescent demanded
Israel that allows access to
ambulances while authority
Palestine referred to this operation of
brutal aggression and war crime
has also called to protest in all
Bank and in fact to the victims already
a young man from Ramala has joined that
I was 21 years old and when this
Morning received a bullet on the head
of the Israeli forces of the side
Israeli this operation has overshadowed
day of protests against reform
judicial and the act of the government of
Netanyahu who demands that even
With this operation ongoing it is not
Stoping the advance of several projects
Of law
