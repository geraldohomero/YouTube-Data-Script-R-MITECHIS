RANDOM ATTACK BY A KNIFE
WIELDING EXTREMIST.
CTV'S DANIELE HAMAMDJIAN ON HOW
IT STARTED.
>> Reporter: MID-AFTERNOON IN
A SUPERMARKET, A MAN UNDER
SURVEILLANCE WALKED IN FOR WHAT
WAS THOUGHT TO BE A REGULAR
SHOPPING TRIP.
INSTEAD HE PICKED UP A KNIFE AND
BEGAN STABBING THOSE AROUND HIM.
>> A RANDOM GUY, HE JUST STARTED
STABBING THESE TWO LADIES, WHITE
LADIES IN FRONT OF ME, STARTED
STABBING, AND I REALIZE AFTER
THAT, OH, MY GOD, I HAVE TO RUN.
>> Reporter: WITHIN 60
SECONDS, 6 PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED
AND HE HIMSELF WAS KILLED BY
POLICE
[ GUNFIRE ]
[ Bleep ].
>> I'M UNDERCOVER COP, GET BACK,
GET BACK.
I'M GOING TO SHOOT HIM.
AND I STEP BACK, AND HE START
BANG, LIKE, FIVE, SIX SHOTS, AND
HE WAS LAYING ON THE FLOOR.

>> Reporter: A SRI LANKAN
NATIONAL WHO WAS WELL KNOWN TO
THE COUNTRY'S SECURITY AGENCY.
>> IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY AN
INDIVIDUAL.
NOT A FAITH, NOT A CULTURE, NOT
AN ETHNICITY, BUT AN INDIVIDUAL
PERSON WHO WAS GRIPPED BY
IDEOLOGY THAT IS NOT SUPPORTED
HERE.
>> Reporter: THE PRIME
MINISTER SAID SHE HAD BEEN
PERSONALLY BRIEFED ON THE MAN IN
THE PAST, BUT THERE HAD BEEN NO
LEGAL REASON FOR HIM TO BE
DETAINED.
POLICE SAY THEY WERE AS CLOSE TO
HIM AS POSSIBLE, WITHOUT
COMPROMISING THEIR SURVEILLANCE
OPERATION.
>> THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN YOU
ARE SURVEILLING SOMEONE ON A
24/7 BASIS, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO
BE IMMEDIATELY NEXT TO THEM AT
ALL TIMES.
>> Reporter: THE SUPERMARKET
WHERE THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE IS
ONE OF THE FEW BUSINESSES STILL
OPEN IN AUCKLAND.
THE CITY IS CURRENTLY IN A
STRICT COVID LOCKDOWN.
