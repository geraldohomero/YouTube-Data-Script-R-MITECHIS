.
GOOD NIGHT, LISA.
>> Lisa: MILITARY FIGHT IS
ONLY ONE PART OF THIS CRISIS.
THE ESCAPE AS YOU HAVE SEEN IS
ANOTHER.
THIS SATELLITE IMAGE SHOWS A
LINE SIX KILOMETRES LONG TODAY
AT A BORDER CROSSING WITH
ROMANIA WHERE THERE WERE
EMOTIONAL SCENES AS PEOPLE LEFT
THEIR LIVES AND IN SOME CASES
MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES
BEHIND.
100,000 HAVE FLED AND HALF IN
THE LAST 48 HOURS ALONE.
THE COUNTRY THAT WILL RECEIVE
THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF REFUGEES
IS POLAND WHERE CTV'S DANIELLE
HAMAMDJIAN REPORTS FROM TONIGHT.
>> Reporter: THE POLISH BORDER
IS NOW OPEN TO ALL UKRAINIANS
ITS GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED EVEN
THOSE WITHOUT VALID DOCUMENTS.
BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS THEY
LEFT UKRAINE TODAY, NOT KNOWING
WHAT WILL BE LEFT OF THEIR
COUNTRY WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER.
WE SPENT TWELVE HOURS AT THE
PEDESTRIAN BORDER SHE SAID.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND
IT'S VERY SCARY.
THEY CROSSED INTO ROMANIA,
HUNGARY, INTO SLOVAKIA.
THE MEN HAVE TO FIGHT, SAID THIS
WOMAN, AND WE AND THE CHILDREN
MUST LEAVE.
UNITED NATIONS FEARS UP TO FIVE
MILLION PEOPLE COULD BE
DISPLACED DUE TO THIS CONFLICT.
>> THERE ARE MORE THAN 100,000
PEOPLE WHO WE ESTIMATE HAVE LEFT
THEIR HOMES AND MAY BE DISPLACED
INSIDE THE COUNTRY AND WHERE
ALSO WHERE SEVERAL THOUSAND WHO
HAVE CROSSED INTERNATIONAL
BORDERS IN THE REGION.
>> Reporter: AMONG THOSE WHO
ARRIVED ON POLISH SOIL TONIGHT
WAS THIS PROFESSOR AND HER TWO
CHILDREN.
SHE IS WORRIED ABOUT SHOWING HER
FACE ON CAMERA, THOUGH SHE IS
HAPPY TO TELL US WHERE SHE WANTS
TO GO.
>> FIRST STAGE IS POLAND BECAUSE
I HAVE A SISTER HERE, AND SOME
FRIENDS HERE, AND THEN THE NEXT
WILL BE CANADA.
>> WHERE IN CANADA?
>> VANCOUVER.
>> IF SHE SOUNDS STOIC, SHE SAYS
IT'S FOR THE KIDS.
THERE IS FEAR, THERE IS
UNCERTAINTY, AND AT TIMES, A
SENSE OF GUILT OF HAVING LEFT
LOVED ONES BEHIND.
AND THIS BORDER CROSSING REMAINS
OPEN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.
SO MANY TIMES TONIGHT WE HAVE
SEEN CASES OF UKRAINIAN MEN WHO
LIVE HERE IN POLAND OR
NEIGHBOURING EU COUNTRIES AND
WHO HAVE DECIDED TO GO BACK TO
FIGHT.
LISA.
>> Lisa: NEED ALL THE HELP
THEY CAN GET.
