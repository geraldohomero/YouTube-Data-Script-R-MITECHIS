The buildings are repaired that
They return are the human lives that have been
Lost forever a concern
Only for those men and women of
good but also for different
worldwide leaders especially
religious as is the case of the Pope
Francisco who met today separately
With Israeli relatives of Reenes
retained by ever and with Palestinians with
family in Gaza and said the conflict
had gone beyond the war to
become terrorism in a speech
without
script at your general audience in the
San Pedro Square shortly after
Meetings in your
Residence Francisco said he heard
directly how both parties are
suffering in this
Conflict said this is what the
wars but here we have gone beyond
Wars This is not a war this
It is terrorism pointed out asking prayers
so that both parties do not continue
With passions that in the end kill everyone
a group of Palestinians present in the
Audience showed images of bodies
wrapped in white fabrics that is the
how to bury Islamic mode and a
banner that said the naba continues

Everyone speaks but nobody does anything
Pope's meetings and comments
They produced hours after Israel and
They will never remember a fire in Gaza
For at least 4 days to allow
help entry and release at least 50
Hostages captured by militants to
Change of at least 150 Palestinians
imprisoned in Israel some speak
that in reality those imprisoned in
Israel are 5000 but at least this
It is a first part Israel has submitted
to Gaza to a siege and a bombing
incessant since ever militants
They attacked cities in southern Israel on 7
October in that attack there is talk of
1200
dead since then have died more
of 14000 Gazat√≠ about 40% of them
children according to medical officials of the
Gaza territory figures considered
reliable by
UNID
