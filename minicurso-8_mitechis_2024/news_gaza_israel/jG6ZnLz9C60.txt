A VIGIL WAS HELD FOR THE
TEENAGER KNOWN AS NAHEL.
THE 17-YEAR-OLD OF MORROCCAN
ALGERIAN WHOSE SHOOTING AT
POINTBLANK RANGE BY POLICE AT A
TRAFFIC STOP SPARKED THIS
UNREST.

CONCLUDED CONDITIONS FOR THE
LEGAL USE OF THE WEAPON WERE NOT
MET.
HE ANNOUNCED THE OFFICER IS
UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR
VOLUNTARY HOMICIDE.
STILL, THE OFFICER'S DETENTION
DID LITTLE TO QUELL PROTESTS.

EXECUTION SAYS TRACY LAGIE OF

FOR THINGS TO CALM DOWN.

THEIR WEAPONS MORE FREQUENTLY
DURING TRAFFIC STOPS.

INEQUITY
