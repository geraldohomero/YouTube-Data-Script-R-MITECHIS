the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem
a sacred site for the 2 and a half
billion Christians around the
globe and as father isaia is about to
show
us the church was built on top of a cave
where Christians believe it all
began the exact spot where Jesus was
born only one other person is here an
Armenian tourist I feel like uh I
connect with something very
important where everything
starts there would normally be thousands
of people filing in and out of this
church this time of year but look at it
now it is completely
empty we know that God's give us
strength and we continue one of the
world's oldest churches is now a
casualty of one of the longest running
conflicts this is what exactly we are
grieving we're sad for what happening so
we would like actually to pray for peace
for
love but those prayers this year will be
made in complete
silence manger square right outside the
church is traditionally the focal point
of Christmas
celebrations but not even covid reduced
it to this due to the conflict in Gaza
Christmas festivities in Bethlehem have
been cancelled no tree no lights no
Nativity
seen the only ones you'll see are being
handcrafted in Wood
factories along with crosses and other
sculptures only to sit on store shelves
waiting for customers who aren't coming
now there is no one it's like a desert I
never seen in my life Bethlehem like
[Music]
that and no one has ever seen Gaza like
this around a thousand Christians live
in Gaza and this is what the only
Catholic Church in The Enclave looked
like last month over the weekend a
mother and daughter seeking shelter
there were killed Catholic officials say
they were shot by an Israeli
sniper the pope condemned the attack
calling the targeting of civilians
terrorism roughly 50,000 Christians
remain in the West Bank but the numbers
are shrinking rapidly my role in
Bethlehem is to keep the Christian
Community in Bethlehem as not to leave
because I don't want to turn this
beautiful Church into
Museum rash a third generation shop
owner leaving the holy land is not an
option for me I always say we have a
mission to resist to remain in this
place but we have also to think about
our children about our future the
children of
