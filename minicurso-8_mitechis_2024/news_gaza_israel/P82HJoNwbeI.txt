>> Todd: GET AN UPDATE FROM TREY
YINGST LIVE FROM SOUTHERN 
ISRAEL.
TREY.
>> Trey: TODD, CARLEY, GOOD 
MORNING.
THE BATTLES INSIDE GAZA RAGE ON 
BEHIND ME.
ISRAELI FORCES ARE REPORTEDLY 
SURROUNDING THREE SEPARATE 
HOSPITALS IN THE GAZA STRIP 
WHERE THEY SAY MILITANTS ARE 
HIDING.
NORTHERN PART OF GAZA, WE'VE 
BEEN WATCHING THE ISRAELIS RENEW
STRIKES AGAINST THIS AREA.
ISRAEL SAYS 37 SOLDIERS IN TOTAL
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE BATTLE 
SINCE THE GROUND PORTION OF THIS
OPERATION BEGAN.
ISRAEL PUSHED DEEPER INTO GAZA 
TARGETING FORCES THAT 
PARTICIPATE IN THE OCTOBER 7 
MASSACRE.
THEY KILLED COMMANDERS AND 
PLATOON COMMANDERS FROM HAMAS 
WHO IN PART WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE SLAUGHTER OF CIVILIANS IN 
EARLY OCTOBER.
SEPARATE GUN BATTLE INSIDE GAZA 
CITY.
THEY CONTINUE AIRSTRIKES 
THROUGHOUT TUNNEL POSITIONS, THE
STRIKES SHAKING THE GROUND AND 
ISRAELIS ARE LOOKING TO HIT 
HAMAS ABOVE AND BELOW GROUND.
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET MORE 
CIVILIANS OUT OF THE WAY, 
OPENING A CORRIDOR FOR 
PALESTINIANS TO GO TO GAZA.
80,000 PALESTINIANS TOOK THE 
CORRIDOR YESTERDAY.
ATTACKS CONTINUE FROM IRANIAN 
PROXIES, NOT JUST AGAINST 
ISRAEL, AGAINST AMERICAN FORCES.
DOZENS OF ATTACKS TOOK PLACE 
SINCE THE WAR BEGAN AND FOUR 
SEPARATE ATTACKS HAVE TAKEN 
PLACE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.
TODD AND CARLEY.
>> Carley: TREY, YESTERDAY THE 
UNITED STATES ANNOUNCED 
FOUR-HOUR PAUSES IN FIGHTING.
BRET BAIER SPOKE TO ISRAELI 
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU AND 
WE'LL PLAY MORE OF THAT AFTER WE
SPEAK TO YOU.
BUT HE PUSHED BACK ON THAT IDEA 
AND SAID THE FIGHTING WILL 
CONTINUE, THERE WILL JUST BE 
HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS THAT WILL
OPEN UP.
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THESE 
PAUSES?
>> Trey: ABSOLUTELY, I TALKED TO
A DEFENSE OFFICIAL LAST NIGHT 
WHO INDICATED AMERICANS CAME OUT
WITH THIS IDEA THERE WOULD BE 
FOUR-HOUR PAUSES ACROSS THE 
BOARD IN THE FIGHTING AND 
ISRAELIS SAY THAT IS NOT THE 
CASE.
THEY ARE CALLING THIS A TACTICAL
PAUSE THAT WILL BE IN CERTAIN 
NEIGHBORHOODS TO GET MORE 
CIVILIANS OUT OF THE WAY.
ONE PART OF THIS, ISRAELIS 
SURROUNDED HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN
PART OF THE STRIP AND THERE ARE 
CIVILIANS BEING TREATED IN THE 
HOSPITALS.
EXPECT COMING HOURS TO BE 
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF 
INFORMATION WE RECEIVE OUT OF 
GAZA TO BE CLEAR WHAT IS T
