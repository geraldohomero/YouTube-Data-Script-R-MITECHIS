the passing of time has done nothing to
lessen the horrors of October the 7th or
heal the people who survived the attacks
and now live with the terrible memories
of that day Ramy schm was the organizer
of the Nova Music Festival he is haunted
by the signs of sexual abuse he found
when he returned to the site what my
eyes saw is only three young girls and
the way we we saw them the way we found
them it's it's like it's it's I mean
they didn't just rape them and abuse
them sexually they humiliated
them in the way they killed them
executed them murdered
them it's it's something
that's
that monsters only
do one of the the the girls over
there they spread the
fuel on her
face and tortured her like the candle
the accounts of sexual violence are
almost unspeakable women raped so
violently that their pelvises broke
people shot in their genitalia young
girls found bound stripped and
shot Hamas vehemently denies its
Fighters raped anyone and it would
contradict Islamic teaching but Israeli
experts believe that sexual violence was
a deliberate tactic of genocide it is
seen as an extremely potent manner to
achieve the ultimate
humiliation and Devastation for of the
enemy the body of the woman is perceived
to be as a symbol of the body of the
nation so violating
invading the body of women is taken as
if the whole nation is being invaded and
violated Israel feels the world has been
too slow to speak up and condemn acts of
gender-based violence I say to the
women's rights organizations to the
human rights
organizations you've heard of the
rape of Israeli
women horrible atrocities sexual
mutilation where the hell are you
because so many the victims and the
attackers are dead Gathering evidence
and building criminal cases will be very
hard many of the corpses were too
decomposed by the time they could be
retrieved many of the Dead were buried
quickly under Jewish law before the
testimonies of sexual violence were
properly realized or
understood the trauma of Israel's
blackest day gets ever
