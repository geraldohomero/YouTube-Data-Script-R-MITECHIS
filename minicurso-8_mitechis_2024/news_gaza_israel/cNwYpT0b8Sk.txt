About the solution
Politics in the East
We have spoken here we have
Treated two states something that has not yet
there are or others point out that the
possibility of two states is gone and
what should there be one that contained
both
We often listened to what we listened to
what the Colombian president said there are
others as Belgium's Prime Minister
or the primary of Spain SÃ¡nchez that
He said he would actually be willing to
Recognize Palestine as a state
independent thing that according to others already
It should have happened and that if that
There maybe we would not be living
This conflict and reporting so
number of deaths on one side and another
and the insecurity on one side and
Another other government and another personality and
Another ruler has turned on
non -sun definition is not European but it is
of the Russian Federation is Vladimir Putin
who claimed today that the creation of a
Palestinian state on the borders of
1967 is the key condition for a
fair and lasting arrangement to conflict
Israeli Palestinian and this said it in a
Message to the authority leader
National Palestine Mahmud Abbas
Today when the bloody conflict
causes innumerable sufferings to
Civil Population of Palestine I consider
especially important to confirm the
Consequent position of Russia in favor
of the exercise of the legitimate rights
of his people to create his own state
Sovereign on the borders of
1967 Putin's message to the president
Palestine was read by the vice minister
Russian outdoor m
Bogdanov on an act on the occasion of the day
International solidarity with
peoples
Palestinians commemorating the 29 of
November the Russian president stressed that
precisely the creation of a state
Palestine on the borders of
1967 is the key condition to achieve
An Israeli Palestinian agreement just
global and
durable
