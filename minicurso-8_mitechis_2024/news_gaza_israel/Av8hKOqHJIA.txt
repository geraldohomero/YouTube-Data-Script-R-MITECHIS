 
>> SOURCES ARE TELLING CBS NEWS 
AT THE CURRENT PHASE OF THE 
OFFENSIVE SHOULD BE COMPLETED 
IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE WEEKS. 
>> IT DOES MEAN THAT THE 
MILITARY WOULD POTENTIALLY 
LOWER THE INTENSITY.  
>> ALL OF THIS COMES ON THE 
HEELS OF THE ISRAEL DEFENSE 
MINISTER SAYING IT IS EXPECTED  
TO LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND THIS 
COMES AS JAKE SULLIVAN IS 
MEETING WITH COUNTRY LEADERSHIP 
AND THEIR FACING PRESSURE TO 
LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CIVILIAN 
CASUALTIES IN GAZA AND HEAVY 
RAIN IS IMPACTING HUMANITARIAN 
EFFORTS. 
>> WE ARE JOINED BY HUGO 
BACHEGA  IN ISRAEL. 
>> Reporter:  I THINK IT IS 
VERY INTERESTING THAT THE FIRST 
MEETING JAKE SULLIVAN HAD WITH 
THE ISRAEL LEADERSHIP WAS WITH 
THE DEFENSE MINISTER WHO SAID  
ISRAEL  NEEDED MORE TIME. 
AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA IS 
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT HIS FAMILY 
AND THESE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. 
THEY ARE DISCUSSING A TIMELINE 
FOR THE END OF THE WAR IN GAZA 
AND OFFICIALS WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT WEEKS AND NOT ONCE AND 
SOME PRESSURE TO USE MORE 
PRECISE HOMES WHEN ATTACKING 
HAMAS. 
THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS HAVE 
BEEN KILLED, INCLUDING  A LARGE 
NUMBER OF CIVILIANS. THERE HAS 
BEEN A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL 
PRESSURE AND CALLS ARE GROWING 
FOR A CEASE-FIRE.  THEY SAY 
THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO 
ELIMINATE HAMAS AND THAT ANY 
KIND OF CEASE-FIRE  WOULD BE A 
GIFT FOR HAMAS . 
>> AND GIVEN THAT THEY SAID IT 
WOULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS STILL 
AND LAST WEEKEND THEY WERE 
SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED AT 
LEAST UNTIL FEBRUARY TO ACHIEVE 
THE GOAL OF DESTROYING HAMAS 
AND I THINK THEY ARE FAR FROM 
DECLARING  VICTORY AND HAVE 
STILL NOT CAPTURED OR KILLED 
THE LEADERSHIP AND HE IS STILL 
MISSING AND THE AUTHORITIES 
BELIEVE THAT HE COULD BE HIDING 
IN A KEY TARGET FOR THE 
OFFENSIVE.  
>> HUGO BACHEGA ,  THANK YOU. 
>> IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE 
HAMAS ATTACKED, KILLING AROUND 
1200 PEOPLE . 
>> SOME HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN 
RELEASED AND OTHERS ARE STILL 
HELD CAPTIVE IN GAZA. 
PRESIDENT BIDEN SPOKE WITH 
FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE TAKEN 
HOSTAGE, INCLUDING THE MOTHER  
HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN .  
>> WE NOW BECAUSE THE HAMAS, 
FELL OFF AND WE HAVE THIS 
FOOTAGE  OF HERSH  WITH HIS ARM 
WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT HE IS 
NOT JUST CRITICALLY WOUNDED BUT 
HE IS NOW DISABLED.
