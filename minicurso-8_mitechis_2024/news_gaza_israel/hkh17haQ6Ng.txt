KIDS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE HAVE
NOW ARRIVED IN TORONTO.
CTV'S HEATHER WRIGHT REPORTS.
>> Reporter: RUN FAST, THIS 
MOTHER TELLS HER SON.
DON'T CRY.
RUN FAST.
THIS IS THE REALITY FOR CHILDREN
IN UKRAINE.
RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES AND FROM
THEIR HOMES.
>> 24th OF FEBRUARY.
>> Reporter: THAT'S THE LAST DAY
16-YEAR-OLD ELMIRA WAS IN 
SCHOOL.
SHE'S LIVING IN THIS THEATRE IN 
POLAND WITH HER MOM, SISTER AND 
DOZENS OF OTHERS FAMILIES 
INCLUDING OKSANA AND HER 
7-MONTH-OLD SON ALEXANDER.
HER HUSBAND STAYED BEHIND TO 
FIGHT.
SHE SAYS SHE HOPES UKRAINE IS 
GOING TO WIN AND THAT THEY WILL 
BE ABLE TO GO HOME AND REBUILD.
IN BUDAPEST, THESE TWO GIRLS ARE
GIVEN STUFFED ANIMALS AND 
CHOCOLATE.
AT A HOSTILE NOW HOME TO 
REFUGEES.
UNICEF HAS COUNSELLORS DEPLOYED 
THROUGHOUT THE REGION.
EVEN IN TRAIN STATIONS IN 
KHARKIV WHERE CHILDREN MUST 
SLEEP BECAUSE OF THE BOMBING. 
>> REMEMBER, WHEN WE SAY FLEE 
THEIR HOMES WE MEAN LEAVE LOVED 
ONES.
WE MEAN LEAVE SAFE SPACE.
WE MEAN
QUITE OFTEN UNDER BOMBARDMENT.
MAYBE SPEND DAYS IN A BUNKER 
BEFORE THEY GET A CHANCE TO 
ACTUALLY LEAVE THEIR HOUSE.
INVARIABLY IT MEANS HUSBANDS AND
WIVES EMBRACING FOR THE LAST 
TIME AT THAT MOMENT.
IT CERTAINLY MEANS DADS TRYING 
TO EXPLAIN TO KIDS WHY THEY'RE 
LEAVING. 
>> Reporter: EVEN THOSE FIGHTING
OTHER BATTLES ARE FORCED TO 
LEAVE.
FIVE CHILDREN WITH CANCER AND 
THEIR FAMILIES TOUCHED DOWN IN 
TORONTO THIS WEEK WHERE THEY 
WILL BE TREATED AT SickKIDS 
HOSPITAL. 
>> THE RESILIENCE OF THESE 
CHILDREN WHO HAVING HAD THEIR 
LIVES COMPLETELY DISRUPTED CAN 
STILL LAUGH AT SILLY JOKES OR 
ENJOYING BEATING ADULTS EVEN 
MYSELF AS CARD GAMES IS QUITE 
AWE INSPIRING. 
>> Reporter: STILL PSYCHOLOGISTS
WILL WORK ALONGSIDE ONCOLOGISTS 
TO HELP TREAT THE TRAUMA OF WAR.
SickKIDS SAYS IT HAS CAPACITY TO
TREAT MORE UKRAINIAN PATIENTS AS
DO OTHER HOSPITALS IN CANADA.
THE LOGISTICS ARE OFTEN 
COMPLICATED.
BUT THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT MAY
EXTEND TO CHILDREN BATTLING 
OTHER ILLNESSES, NOT JUST 
CANCER.
