It will be a huge pleasure we are going to
start to introduce them to the rest of
my companions huh but there is a subject
central that has to do with the more than
5 months already have been
Gaza what is the land incursion
We are going to talk about the forces of Israel
of numerical issues there you can read
In the Graf on the Channel 26 screen
31,000 people in the Gaza Strip
dead by Israeli attacks on this
logically you have to add the amount
of deaths under the
debris eh something that at some point
eh must be resolved is one of the topics
central the amount of injured and
We talk eh simply about issues
physical eh when the war ends the
postwar
in psychological matters that always
It is spoken eh when it ends eh some of
such magnitude of the numbers
centrals of what is happening in
Today's day a little more than 5 months
The amount of dead the injured
ascend to
72654 eh I think it's important to mark
which is information from the Ministry of
Health of the Palestinian Enclave that today
is controlled by the rebel group by
They never have de facto this
place where the Palestinians live
Let us remember in S Jordan and in the Strip
Gaza today is everything centralized here
It is from where the attack on
Kbos where more than 100 Israelis died
That is why then logically emerges
what is the land incursion on
Gaza's strip something else is about what
that estimates the ministry of 7000 bodies
of missing people who are trapped
Under the rubble medical sources
Palestinas reported today
Sunday eh that at least 15 people and
dozens of injured in a bombing
against tents huh these are
displaced eh in the town of Almasi
We talk about the West of the Interior
Shan Yunis is the south of the strip of
Gaza and this is where the
more fierce already has already
more than 5 months finally and we continue
quantifying the situation leaving
Numbers the official Palestinian agency
Uafa informs that 37 dead 118
injured have arrived at the MÃ¡rtir hospital
From Al Axa this in the center of the enclave
And it has occurred because of several attacks
Israelis in the area
including artillery against homes
