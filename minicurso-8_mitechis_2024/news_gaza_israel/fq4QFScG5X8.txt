Well what they listen to is the translator of
in turn the translator who among them
They keep Ebrahim Raisi Vladimir Putin
says what is happening in grace is
in Gaza it is
unsustainable cannot continue to occur
must stop as soon as possible and
bombings that are producing
where Raisi says what is in
reality is killing innocent people
civilians and mostly children in
Gaza must stop peace must arrive
And you must urgently do it, huh called
From Iran called with which he is abut
of
agreement we listen to that closure that
happening and we look for the analysis
I also insist on this appearance
Entah and Vladimir Putin will go and Russia no
They will say that we only put
Joiden are going to
All
ends that meeting insist
the obvious conclusions huh those
They see I want to say now that
that bilateral meeting between both
I was grateful for the way the visit your own
Raisi and Vladimir Putin takes another step
there the strength you are trying
Show in Ukraine with that invasion
where Russia is increasing its
Special attacks via drones
having success in the part of the
rear of Ukraine and trying to
also cut their own
attacks that Ukraine eh tries or or has
exercises towards the rear of Russia
Well that strength that seems
wanting to show Vladimir Putin I don't know
It is only about what happens in the field
of battle but already shows
Something that did not do that is to leave
Russia today we see in Iran we see him
move with Emirates with
Saudi Arabia we also saw it for the
good week good last week no
makes two
days we are seeing an eident movement
in which he begins to have an opening
that you know you have the
Brazil's invitation for the G20 is going to
Being able to go by jumping
I insist that famous court order
International penalty to stop him is
already in that Vladimir Putin himself is
Of course playing another game and with
Other cards on the other side of the screen
I think it is
