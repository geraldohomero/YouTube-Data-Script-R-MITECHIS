curfew and many groups of Jews
ultra right have vandalized
Arab shops they burned a lot
moreover in this same city and
Many Israeli Arab rioters
This time shot a police officer and
On a civilian and a synagogue was

Small groups that act at night
But the police seem to have the most
great difficulty in controlling them then Benyamin
