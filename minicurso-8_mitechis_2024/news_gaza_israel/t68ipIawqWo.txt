And the smell of gunpowder and the corpses of the corpses

Darshan is wandering in search of safe hideouts
After Israel's warning before the attack
The people of Gaz go to the border to save their lives
Has arrived but so far any Arab country
No doors for Gaza

But every country is shying away by giving shelter
