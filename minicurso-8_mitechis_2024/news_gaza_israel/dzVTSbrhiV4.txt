EFFORT FAIL IN CONGRESS.
SO THE VICE PRESIDENT RENEWING
CALLS FOR THAT TODAY
>> LET'S TAUB ABOUT TH
POLITICS
PRESIDENT BIDEN VISITING
MICHIGAN FOR THE SECOND TIME I
A MATTER OF WEEKS BUT AGAIN, NOT
SITTING DOWN WITH THE LARGE ARAB
AMERICAN AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIE
IN THE STATE
THOSE COMMUNITIES PLAYED A BIG
ROLE IN THE 100,000 STRONG
UNCOMMITTED VOTE IN THE MICHIGAN
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY IN FEBRUARY
THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH HIMOVE
THE WAR IN GAZA.
IT IS A LITTLE SURPRISING THAT
HE IS NOT EVEN TRYING TO REACH
OUT TO THEM IN PERSON WHILE HE
IS THERE
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.
IN FACT THE MAYOR OF DEARBORN, I
SPOKE WITH HIM EARLIER TODAY AND
HE SAID THE WHITE HOUSE HAD NO

ARAB OR MUSLIM COMMUNITY BEFOR
RETURNING TO MICHIGAN FOR TH
FIRST TIME SINCE WE SAW TH
UNCOMMITTED MOVEMENT OFOVE
100,000 VOTERS
MANY OF THEM IN PROTEST TO THE
PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF TH
ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR
THAT IS SPARKING CONCERNS OF
WHAT A WIDER MOVEMENT WILL LOO
LIKE
IN 2020, PRESIDENT BIDEN WON THE
STATE OVER FORMER PRESIDEN
TRUMP BY JUST OVER 150,000
VOTES.
I SPOKE WITH MEMBERS OF TH
COMMUNITY TODAY.
THEY SAID THAT DESPITE THI
SHIFT IN TONE, THE MORE SHAR
RHETORIC OF THE PRESIDEN
CRITICIZING NETANYAHU'S HANDLING
OF THE WAR, AND THE CRISIS I
GAZA THAT HAS BEEN GROWING, THEY
SAY IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH FOR
THEM
THEY WANT TO SEE MORE DRASTI
ACTION
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT THEY TOL
US
>> WE WILL SEE YOU IN NOVEMBER
OUR MOVEMENT IS STRONG AND
GROWING AND IF YOU WANT TO BET
ON BRUSHING OFF THIS MOVEMENT,
GOOD LUCK IN NOVEMBER.
>> Reporter: WORTH NOTING THAT
THE PRESIDENT NOT MEETING WITH
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY HERE IN
MICHIGAN
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT SENIOR WHITE
HOUSE OFFICIALS MET PRIVAT
