Palestinians tied up and with
connected eyes
Driven together Israeli soldiers
who mock about their captured people
Documents of the abuse of workers
from Gaza the whole until October 7th
worked legally in Israel
Had Hamas after the terrorist attack of Hamas
Creeper Israel the permits and
at the same time ran out the gaza strip
Thousands become the workers
West Bank shipped many are
still partly there for weeks
separated from theirs
Families my family is over now
Allgasa scattered all because of
The air strikes from Jabalia flee when
I can only hear it from
New every day
Israel only slowly leaves disasters
The displaced back fathers brothers
Sons are waiting nervously at the border crossing
Kerim Schalom on the southern tip of the
Gaza stripes
The arriving are not weakened
only some of the strainful ride
still wear traces of
Misability they have us behind that
Back tied up the eyes and
I don't know where to go to a bus
It was there but there were 200 or 300
Workers from Gaza You have us how
Dogs are beaten and blocked in cages and
also insults sick and injured
Some men are on the way here
died because you are beaten and
they made electric shocks
Palestinian
Prison law organization Nadi
Al-Assir has been complaining about a long time
legal protection in Israel
Reports of the deported part
frightening you have done nothing
Nothing threw them anyway
many of them interrogate and systematically
tortured they were abused brutal
defeated insulted and on each
conceivable species degraded
The Israeli army wants to
systematic abuse
Palestinian workers do not know anything
However, take the allegations seriously
Individual perpetrators based on videos
could be identified
already prosecuted under disciplinary law
gone
