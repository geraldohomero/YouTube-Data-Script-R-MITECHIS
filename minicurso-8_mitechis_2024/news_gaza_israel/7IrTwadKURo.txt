They have been these last hours in matters
of the incursion of the state of Israel with
His army in the strip of
Gaza good you know that regarding the

Army inside the strip
It has approximately 48 hours huh
We come with a situation so far
We could define it as tactically
similar to the beginning to what happened the
Saturday what happened on Friday I want
Saying the army remains in the
Posture that this does not imply this
incursion that is being made within
The strip does not imply the entrance

paragraph what told you that for the
Army the incursion from the last
48 hours does not imply income as

Last two weeks it means only
who began to attack according to spokesman
of the army to attack sensitive points

The strip both by land and by
Underground because what did transcend
