These Israeli activists fill
Their truck of a few bags of flour
and cans they organized
This symbolic action to show
that he cares about the fate of the population
civil at
Gaza everyone understands that there is
A family in Gaza everyone
understands that if the Gaza population
Israeli hostages are hungry
also suffer normal life cannot
not continue here when a disaster
happens 150 km from TÃ©aviv safety
and the future of the Israeli people by the
end of the humanitarian disaster which
is in progress in Gaza we are here at
Hashkellon and that's where
found standing activists
Together you see there is this truck which
arrived but the police decided to
also come to escort his activists
at least for a part of the path the
truck takes the road to the point
passage from Kerem Chalom He is followed
by a few dozen activists in
car but 3 km from the destination
final a police barrage
activists must do
turn-turn
We were arrested by the police who
has set up a blocking point
temporary and who says it is an area
quarantine soldier we receive
Lots of cries and nervousness
exceeding they say that it is because
From us that all that happens that we
are traitors to our own country
that we betray the hostages and those who have
been killed on the 7th
October because a large majority of the
Israeli population opposes its
activists for peace for
some weeks even go so far
block humanitarian aid to the point of
Passage to Gaza on the sidelines of the procession
they show their disagreements
preventing the help from entering is not
only threaten our future our
future as a people here but it is
also hurt the hostages that are
There I understand their anger but this
is not how it takes it
Show is the second time in one
week that these activists are
rejected by the police near the
passage but they say that he
remains motivated that what is important
For them it is also the age the symbol
And they will start again
