There's been this long delay.
President Biden initially proposed this
back in October last year.
There was Republican opposition that
quickly
got together and effectively stalled
everything because
Republicans said that they couldn't pass
any sort of aid package without first
addressing what they called the crisis
at the southern border.
There was a bipartisan deal that
senators worked out on that that ended
up collapsing after opposition from
former President Trump as well as from
Johnson.
And so since then, we've been in this
stalemate position.
Another thing that Speaker Johnson has
to consider is that there's a rule in
the House that all it takes is one
person to propose a motion to vacate the
chair, in other words, to unseat the
speaker.
And there have been Republicans who have
threatened to do that.
Most recently, Marjorie Taylor GREENE
has said that she wants to have a vote
to vacate the chair to get rid of
Speaker Johnson.
Another Republican, Tom Massie from
Kentucky, has said that he would support
that.
All in all, they now need is one more
because the Republican majority is so
small in the House that Speaker Johnson
can't afford to lose another vote.
If one more Republican says that if this
aid package vote goes through, then
they'll vote to get rid of him, Then
Speaker Johnson would depend on
Democrats to keep his job.
So a lot of different factors in play.
One other thing to keep in mind is in
addition to all this, Johnson has said
that there will be, as part of this
package, a vote from the House that
would condition some of this this aid on
a tick tock bill that would force
Biden's to sell tick tock in the US.
That's something that the House has
already voted on.
The Senate has not voted on.
So if that were to be in the in the
package, that could slow things down a
lot, Tom.
