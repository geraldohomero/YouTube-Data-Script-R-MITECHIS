what can cross right now Egypt says the
border is technically open but that
Israeli air strikes prevent officials
from carrying out the work
normally there are also reports that
talks are going on between Egypt and
other countries to use that Rafa
Crossing to get Aid into Gaza but Egypt
is reportedly also rejecting any plan
that would allow large numbers of people
to leave Gaza through that route US
