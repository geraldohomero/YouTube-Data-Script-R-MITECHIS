TEMPERATURES WILL BE OVERNIGHT
AND LOOK AHEAD TO THE SEVEN DAY
FORECAST. THOSE DETAILS IN JUST
A FEW MINUTES. ALL RIGHT, DAN,
SEE YOU SOON. THANK YOU.
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND ISRAEL PRIME
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAVE
SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN A MONTH. THE TWO
ARE AT ODDS OVER THE WAR IN
GAZA. FOX FOUR'S CAROLINE
SHIVELY HAS MORE FROM WASHINGTON
ON AS THE CIVILIAN DEATH TOLL IN
GAZA MOUNTS ON MONDAY, AFTER
WEEKS OF RISING TENSION,
PRESIDENT BIDEN SPOKE WITH
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU, TELLING HIM THAT
MILITARY OPERATIONS NEED TO BE
SHARE THE GOAL OF DEFEATING
HAMAS, BUT WE JUST BELIEVE YOU
NEED A COHERENT AND SUSTAINABLE
STRATEGY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
THIS COMES AFTER SENATE MAJORITY
LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER CALLED FOR
NEW ISRAELI ELECTIONS LAST WEEK,
CALLING ANTI-GOVERNMENT
PROTESTERS BLOCKED ROADS AND
FOUGHT POLICE OVER THE WEEKEND
IN ISRAEL. IN TEL AVIV, THE
PRIME MINISTER STILL NOT BACKING
DOWN, SAYING MONDAY THAT ISRAEL
MUST DESTROY HAMAS MILITARY AND
GOVERNING CAPABILITIES, SECURE
RETURN OF HOSTAGES AND PREVENT
GAZA FROM BECOMING A THREAT TO
ISRAEL EVER AGAIN. THE DEFEAT
SPELLS TERRIBLE THINGS FOR OUR
FUTURE. IT'S BEEN MORE THAN FIVE
MONTHS SINCE HAMAS LAUNCHED THE
LEFT 1200 DEAD. THE HAMAS RUN
GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY SAYS
ISRAEL'S RETALIATION HAS KILLED
MORE THAN 31,000 PALESTINIANS.
THE ISRAELI MILITARY IS PLANNING
TO MOVE ON RAFAH TO GO AFTER
FOUR HAMAS BATTALIONS, EVEN
THOUGH THERE ARE MORE THAN A
MILLION DISPLACED PALESTINIANS
SHELTERING THERE. IN MONDAY'S
ISRAELI OFFICIALS TO WASHINGTON
TO DISCUSS ALTERNATIVES TO AN
ASSAULT ON RAFAH. WHEN PEOPLE
TELL US DON'T GO INTO RAFAH,
THAT'S LIKE TELLING THE ALLIES,
LISTEN, DON'T GO INTO BERLIN,
LEAVE A QUARTER OF THE ARMY
INTACT. AN AID PACKAGE FOR
ISRAEL REMAINS STUCK IN CONGRESS
WITH NO CLEAR PATH FORWARD. IN
WASHINGTON, CAROLINE SHIVELY,
