- I woke up this morning in Tel Aviv
where I live with my
family, my three children,
and I was playing with
my kids this morning.
It's a Saturday morning
and it's a Jewish holiday,
and so I actually was
not looking at my phone
because I try not to look at
it during Jewish holidays,
I was playing with my
kids in the living room
and I heard a loud boom.
I didn't really think much of it
because we have a lot of
construction in the area,
and I thought maybe it was something
related to construction.
But then a short while
later, my husband came out
and he said, "Have you been
seeing what's going on?"
And he told me that there
had been thousands of rockets
that had been fired and
apparently some shrapnel.
There had been reports that some shrapnel
had hit some buildings in Tel Aviv.
And then after that we had
the rocket sirens go off,
alerting us that there were
rockets in the vicinity.
And so I took my children,
I grabbed my baby
and my husband took my two small boys
and we ran into the
stairwell in our building.
Unfortunately, we don't
have a bomb shelter
in our apartment, many Israelis
do, in newer buildings.
We have an older building
so we just stayed in there
with other residents for about 10 minutes
until the sirens stopped,
and then we went back inside,
and we're staying now in rooms
that have closed windows just to be safe.
(rockets exploding)
Israel has now started to fire on Gaza.
(people chattering)
(vehicles hooting)
The other thing that's been going on is
that Hamas militants broke
through the border between Gaza
and Israel early this morning
by land, air, and sea.
They used paragliders to shoot over,
shoot themselves over the border,
and we have seen images
of many people dead.
There are reports of
people being captured.
(rockets exploding)
Israel has never seen anything like this
since its 75 year existence.
(people shouting)
This is completely
and totally unprecedented
in every single way.
What we're seeing today
is attacks on civilians
on Israeli soil.
Hamas militants have
infiltrated into Israel proper,
so not into disputed
territory, but actually
into Israel's internationally
recognized borders.
They've penetrated beyond
Israeli military points
and they were holding
or appeared to be holding
several Israeli villages
and towns under their control.
