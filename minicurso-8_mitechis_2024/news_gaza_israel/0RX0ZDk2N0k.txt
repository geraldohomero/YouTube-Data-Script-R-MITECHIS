We go to Gaza once again because there I know
is carrying out this war with
The Israeli army with the first
Minister Benjam√≠n Netanyahu at the head
And there is a showcase a leakage point
We could say that Egypt is a country
that allowed him at the time
Palestine the entry of help
humanitarian and that today also represents
a possibility of the highest income
amount of food for example
combustible medicines when we talk
Humanitarian aid is that the basics not
how elementary any needs
person to survive imagine that in
A frame of so much siege of such
desolation Everything is good like this
They arrived with these trucks more than
200,000 tons of humanitarian aid
To the Palestinian enclave this proposed it
And it was promoted by the Egyptian minister of
social solidarity have a ministry
of social solidarity something interesting
also not when one analyzes what is the
Perspective the objective of each government
When creating your cabinet in Egypt
They have created a solidarity or more or
less and through this organism it is
that allow this meal to enter
GAZA, for example, who is going to children
to mothers to good elderly to a
Very vulnerable and very violated population
also especially from the first
October days the minister said that
They are also invited to run in the
Marathon runs through Gaza that will be in the
Cairo by the way the capital of Egypt and
This attracted more than 100,000
participants to collect donations
Minister praised the role of the average
Egyptian red moon to organize
logistics services expand chains of
supply and also store help
received from 37 countries in the world that have
Good sent some more others no
But there are 37 nations that organized
To take the inhabitants of Gaza
very necessary issues for these
hours
