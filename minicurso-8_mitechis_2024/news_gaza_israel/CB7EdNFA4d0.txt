[CC may contain inaccuracies] How realistic is another cease fire?
Well, at this point, it's still very
tentative.
We know that the U.S.
CIA director, William Burns, is in the
region, well, actually in Poland, but
meeting with regional officials.
So there is a lot of desire for this to
happen.
But the big question is how and when
Israel is pressing ahead with its
military campaign against Hamas in the
Gaza Strip.
And
Mr.
Herzog's position is largely ceremonial.
So it is an important signal to suggest
that pressure is mounting on Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government
to do something.
But at this point, we're not seeing
every any sign that a cease fire or a
pause is imminent.
So we've got the U.N.
Security Council debating this issue
right now.
What's the latest there?
Well, we know the U.N.
Security Council has now postponed a
vote on a new resolution that would seek
a suspension in the hostilities until
tomorrow.
So that's been two days of wrangling
over this resolution.
And what that tells us is essentially
there's a deadlock with the United
States, which by voting no for a couple
of resolutions in the past few weeks,
has basically has vetoed them because it
has that power as a permanent member of
the Security Council.
So what we understand is that there are
a lot of negotiations right now.
Of course, that resolution would just
call for a suspension of hostilities.
It wouldn't obligate Israel to do
anything.
So we know that the violence linked to
the war has spilled over into the Red
Sea.
What do we know about those efforts to
push back against Houthi attacks?
Well, what we're hearing, obviously, is
that the US has set up this.
It's called Operation Prosperity
Guardian to protect commercial shipping
in the Red Sea.
So that would be with a coalition of
partners basically using military
vessels to protect commercial ships
traveling through the Red Sea.
However, there are a lot of questions
about whether that's really going to be
doing anything that's that's defensive
in nature.
And what a lot of people are calling for
now are strikes on actual U.S.
targets in Yemen.
The risk there, of course, is that it
would escalate the war significantly.
But we do know at this stage that U.S.
officials are actively considering the
possibility of military strikes at some
point in the near future.
You.
