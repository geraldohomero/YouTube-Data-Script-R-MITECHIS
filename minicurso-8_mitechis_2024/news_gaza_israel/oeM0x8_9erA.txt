Gaza has a daughter of Hamas and a daughter of Hamas
Hamas' father-in-law, half-a-billion-dollar chaff
The government approved Put it in and it went to bomb us off
Gaza's underground military formation is ready
They talk to us about it, they say That one
To put the fear into it is to add to the sin of sin
The crime of bringing in the funds and should give the Tziel all
The time Now in terms of the IDF's non-field informants
Dani doesn't have customer training. That's not how you do it
Operation should give Sham off I turn to all of these
The heroes who demand to bring the army immediately to an end.
This should allow the audience to do so, and in the meantime
Bombing off
The bomb will double if it continues
After we offered everything we have all the terrorists
Need to turn up There is no rush to the ruins
I don't run away from the terrorists in the ass so don't run away either
In two months it will be possible again And Saturday evening
Saturday is a show you're expecting or a dramatic announcement
For the war or for saying I'm not worthy anymore
Worthy And I'm resigning again instead
Throwing away the responsibility for others I call
His performance on Saturday was cheating And breach of trust
Tragic circumstances and a final point he praised
All those who are equal to that country from Australia Oh
From Bainey Hu Station in Singapore Oh, for God's sake
Why wouldn't your son Yair want to volunteer with me again
I don't mean to fight. Volunteer is leadership
Leaders need to be accepted Trust is part of leadership
It's also the responsibility you reveal here was a default
More Israelis were killed here than at any event
That has been the case since the time of the government
And it was Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Galant who gave up
The swamps did not take responsibility for the default
23 It's just the opposite
The leaders of these people are sending more
A few soldiers to battle and it has to be based on
Trust we want Believing the leaders
We are in control and those who do not take responsibility for it
He is constantly concerned about political issues
Instead of dealing with war Which is why I expect
From Benjamin Netanyahu and the other ministers to take responsibility
This failure will only increase trust in the people we are
Going to the campaign's. Months in Gaza
