Well said that some of them
Tomorrow they will return to
Your country, Amen for that.
 In the Gaza Strip
Hospitals also run the
Risk of becoming
True morgues.
 This is warned at this time
After the interruption of
Basic services ordered by the
Israel government.
Borja: In Gaza there is already a lack of
Water, there is no light, and this
Is detonating a crisis
Humanitarian, with newborns
In incubators, with the elderly
That need oxygen and with
Thousands of injured.
This is the language of
War, where the most innocent
They are the ones who suffer the most.
 Andrea LeÃ³n shows us this
Terrible panorama.
Andrea: The horror of war
He has a child's face.
 Gaza residents
They take refuge in a hospital that is
The only safe place in the middle
Of the bombing.
It is a life or death struggle,
Children are the most
Vulnerable and dead and
Injured are counted by thousands.
Whole areas are in ruins,
The houses became tombs,
While people get the
Survivors as they can.
 Some go on stretchers,
But others have their arms
To help, like this
Rescuer, who runs
Loading a little girl, in
Ambulance awaits you
His father and his little sister, he
Try to calm her.
Some mothers fire their
Children with a kiss that could
Be the last.
The deaths do not supply, and
The streets are full of
Bodies
On the other side of the border in
Israel, this young woman only has
A photo of the last image of
His parents at the hands of Hamas,
When they were taken
Kidnapped from your own home.
>> We lost many people from the
Community, of a lifetime,
I just want you to be well.
Andrea: While a soldier
Israeli Peruvian who died in the
Combat, receive the last goodbye.
 The intense fighting have
Intensified aid
Humanitarian, if you want, you can
Donate
