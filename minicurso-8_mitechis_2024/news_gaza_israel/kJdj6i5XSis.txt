Former Prime Minister of Israel
Let's be very big from the statement of Naftali Bennett
Try to understand the gesture getting
Israel's last target octopus head
This is how War Chakra Netanyahu will run again and again Hamas
Taking a vow to the elimination of Hizbullah
Hizbullah's ending Iran is not tolerated
Iran will definitely be able to reply
Yes, yes and this situation will come with action
This statement was given to assessing Israel
Battle with Iran will become its compulsion
In the coming times because Hizbullah and
The attack on Hamas is constantly doing
Israel will not tolerate it to Iran and
Iran will again have a direct battle of Israel
What are the signs that may be seen saying this
This is why Israel psychological pressure was created
The largest by saying the head of octopus
Who is trying to convict
Iran is directly big on Iran
Iran, such a strict statement so far from Israel
You did not bring at all and Sameer
I know from our experts to Colonel Rathore
I am coming to you in 60 seconds
Will answer whether Iran
Hizbullah Hamas has been made a weapon
Is Iran straight through this proxy war
Look at America this Nidhi is challenging America
Iran which is a proxy is Israel right now
That if you have a National Security Consign
If you see Hamas Hizbollah
Islamic Jihad and Al Al Qaeda Brigade A
Al Aksa Brigade all these funded from Iran
Is the problem here when it comes when
Till Iran will not address them
Lebanese Syria will continue active there
West Bank Gaza will remain active here
MN will be active in this way you
Understand this that is the evaluation of Iran
Will not end until Iran
Direct address should not be done
Who is the prime minister, this army himself
He has just shifted himself in the army
Fighting with it to Iran
How Iran is sitting 1500 km from there
Is it a big deal, is Israel this
Time is in this stage amidst war that Iran
Like a strong country can be warned
And Iran is not alone again Russia and
China is also seen standing with her
Big
