INFLATION INCREASING FROM 0.3 OF
A PERCENT TO 0.4 OF A PERCENT,
AND IT'S SOMETHING CERTAINLY
WATCHING FOR THE MONTHS TO COME.
>> THANK YOU FOR THOSE DETAILS.
>>> NOW TO EXCLUSIVE BREAKING
NEWS WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THE
WHITE HOUSE.
I WANT TO BRING BACK NBC'S
MONICA ALBA JOINING US FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?
>> WE ARE JUST LEARNING
PRESIDENT BIDEN INVITED THE
FAMILY MEMBERS OF SOME OF THE
HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY HAMAS AND
POTENTIALLY OTHER MILITANT
GROUPS IN GAZA TO THE WHITE
HOUSE TOMORROW FOR THEIR FIRST
IN-PERSON MEETING.
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE
KNOW, OF COURSE, AT THE WHITE
HOUSE, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION
HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THESE
FAMILIES WHO ARE SEEKING MORE

WHO HAVE BEEN IN CAPTIVITY FOR,
OF COURSE, MORE THAN 60 DAYS.

EXCHANGE DEAL, WHEN THERE WAS A
PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING BETWEEN
ISRAEL AND HAMAS.
THERE'S SOME INFORMATION THAT
HAS BEEN LEARNED BY U.S.
INTELLIGENCE IN TERMS OF HOW
THEY WERE TREATED.
THEY WERE TREATED.
REMEMBER, IT WAS 4-YEAR-OLD
ABIGAIL, AND THEN ANOTHER WOMAN
WAS FREED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO,
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE
EIGHT UNACCOUNTED FOR AMERICANS
BEING HELD.
THERE'S LITTLE THAT IS KNOWN
ABOUT THEIR CONDITION, AND EVEN
ABOUT WHERE SOME OF THEM ARE
BEING HELD VERSUS WHERE OTHER
AMERICANS WERE BEING HELD.
WE KNOW THAT AS THE FIGHTING
RESUMED ON DECEMBER 1st, THERE
WAS A MAJOR QUESTION ABOUT
WHETHER THE CONDITIONS COULD
EXIST AGAIN FOR ANOTHER PAUSE IN
FIGHTING THAT WOULD ALLOW SOME
