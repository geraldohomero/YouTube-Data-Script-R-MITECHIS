so
we continue to receive reports of
significant displacement of palestinians
with over 38 000 internally displaced
people
seeking protection in the in 48
schools run by anwar across the gaza
strip
over 2 500 people have been made
homeless due to the destruction of their
homes
41 educational facilities including
schools
two kindergartens and an ongoing
vocational center
and a higher educational facility have
been
uh damaged according to our people on
the ground
[Music]
so
the fighting risks dragging israelis and
palestinians into a spiral of violence
with devastating consequences
for both communities and for the entire
region
it has the potential to unleash an
unconscious and containable security and
humanitarian crisis
and to further foster extremism not only
in the occupied palestinian territory in
israel
but in the region as a whole
[Music]
[Music]
israel has the right to defend itself
there is no equivalence between a
terrorist group indiscriminately firing
rockets at civilians
and a country defending its people from
those attacks
so we call on hamas and other groups in
gaza to end
the rocket attacks immediately any
diplomatic initiative that advances
that prospect is something that uh that
will support
and we're again willing and ready uh to
do that but ultimately
it is up to the parties to make clear
that they
want to pursue a ceasefire
immediate de-escalation is the need of
the r so as to arrest
any further slide towards the brink we
urge
both sides to show extreme restraint
desist from actions that exacerbate
tensions
and refrain from attempts to
unilaterally change the
existing status quo including in east
jerusalem
and its neighborhood
