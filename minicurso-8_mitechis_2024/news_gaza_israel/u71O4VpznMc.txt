celebrations of the cease-fire after
friday prayers
but the mood at al-aqsa mosque soon
turned
a familiar corner tear gas and rubber
bullets from police
rocks from some worshipers it's unclear
what triggered the skirmishes
in gaza there was peace but also a grim
reality
many residents returning to where they
used to live
this woman said this truce is only good
for those who have homes
where are we supposed to go gazan
authorities
say 65 children there were killed
that figure is two in israel
that contrast didn't stop a hamas leader
declaring
a strategic victory the palestinians
believe that for the first time
they've broken israel's monopoly on the
narrative and that the world is finally
taking note and listening
to the palestinian narrative and
following palestinian social media
that has enabled them to bypass
mainstream media
benjamin netanyahu still clinging on to
his job as israeli leader
claimed victory took down
the campaign as an outstanding success
that degraded hamas ability to attack
israel
it's important for him that he wanted to
make the show of force
to remind the israelis to say look you
have an enemy sitting on your border i'm
the one who's been protecting you
but the thread of a new conflict remains
very real
hamas doesn't recognize israel's right
to exist
we have no plans to change our security
assistance
that we're providing to israel a
resolution from u.s senator bernie
sanders to block a huge arms sale to
israel
is unlikely to pass but it does indicate
the rising number of democrats voicing
concern for the scale of u.s support for
israel
something the israeli government will at
least be taking note of
when making its next move redmond
