For the last 28 days between Hamas and Israel

More fighters have been killed in October
Hizbullah 20 in the third week
More fighters were killed and after that
Hizbullah appeared to be cold
Was but now as time is moving forward
Gradually he returns to the war again
It is visible while doing this but this
After the threat of Bulla Chief, now the war is already
The possibility of getting more severe increased
Iran is never a war on its land
Will fight because his strategist
Iran's government is smart, Yemen Iraq and
America using land to Syria
And attacking Israel's bases
Is to establish its roots in these countries
Iran has worked hard for years and now that
Leban wants to take advantage of it
It is the country that slowly in the grip of war
Going to come
This report by Leban's newspaper male net
Israel has done the Bleed area
Fosphorus bomb in eastern outskirts
Attacked due to which present there
There was a heavy fire in the surrounding forests
Fussforus bomb fire in long area
Spreaded forests caused heavy damage
This is constantly said by Israel
It has been that Lebanon on Hizbullah's shoulders
No risk of jumping into battle by keeping a gun
Pick up because this time Lebanon is very badly
Will be in the grip of war and then saying this
Can't stand that he can be in this battle
Hizbulla dragged
Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu has already said that Leban
This time will be given such an answer that he
The second war is not capable of fighting
Will survive

Apart from Netanyahu, Israel's Defense Minister
Yoga Galant has already said that this
Israel's revenge in war will decide that
Israel on Israel's land for next 75 years
Whether or not it will still be 50 Hizbullah's 50
There were reports of more fighters being killed
It has been done but despite this, Israel
The Defense Minister has given a statement that now
He does not expand war
Want
Manali
The noteworthy thing is when Israel
No expansion of war on Northern border
Wants to fought more than 45 Hizbullah then
If you are killed, then the question arises
That if Israel will expand the war
Then what is the condition of Hizbulla
Will be
