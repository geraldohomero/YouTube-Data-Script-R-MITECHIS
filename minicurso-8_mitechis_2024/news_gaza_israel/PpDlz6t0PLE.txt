what is red green white and black and
represents the palestinian identity
it's not the flag it's the watermelon
[Music]
since it's summer time in gaza and the
height of watermelon season let's talk
about the story of how
this delicious fruit became a symbol of
resistance
the watermelon has become a symbol of
palestinian resistance over several
decades
as it reflects the color of palestinian
flag red green white and black but what
is the story behind this
in 1967 when israel occupied the west
bank and the gaza strip israelis
government banned all public disciplines
of the palestinian flag and its scholars
those who fly the flag in a protest on
their cars or in the streets could be
arrested instead palestinians got
creative bringing along slices of
watermelon to protests
in 1980 israeli forces shut down a large
art gallery in ramallah and arrested the
three artists nabil anani sliman mansour
and sambadar during the crackdown
officers vowed to confiscate any
paintings that reflected or encouraged
palestinian struggle including any
images of watermelon that murdered the
colors of the palestinian flag
this encouraged more palestinians to
start using the fruit as a way to fight
back
in 1993 at the height of the first
intifada the new york times ran a story
detailing how the israeli army had begun
detaining any palestinian coat carrying
slices of watermelon
thirty years later
and it's no surprise the watermelon has
cemented its ablaze in palestinian
society becoming an official symbol for
the palestinian struggle

it's red
and very sweet really
[Music]
um
[Music]
over 74 years of struggle palestinians
have found creative ways of protesting
against israeli activation
and watermelon has become nature's own
palestinian flag
a simple and juicy way of passing our
heritage and history to the next
generation
