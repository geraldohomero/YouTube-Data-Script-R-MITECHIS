and the conflict center what we come
speaking since October 7 when
It was ever the attack on Israel is this
war that broke out after what was
Well the attack of ever and the
Israel's counteroffensive against ever and
against the Palestinian people and that is
accused of genocide by some countries
And at this time Netanyahu the
President of Israel is defending
this
accusation does particularly what Maa
The report with which we start this
program has to do with the accusation
of several international entities in
Relationship to the action of El Army
Israeli in the Gaza Strip is already spoken
of a genocide not something that would change the
logic and understanding of this
war since clearly a genocide
implies a enough power relationship
unequal among armies eh one of
The main politicians to
demonstrate about it was the own
Netan Yahu who denied this when
The first audience over this end
procedure in court
International of Laa where you are
resolving in these hours good this
issue is not this accusation that great
part of the western world does well
He is accused of genocide for
South Africa and this is before the Court
UN INTERNATIONAL OF THE UN
Made the legal team of South Africa
He began on Thursday to expose his
legal arguments against maximum
UN court to demand measures
Urgent precautionary against Israel Country
who is accused of having an intention
genocidal in his war in Gaza and demands
end the bombings on the
Strip we also remember about this
situation that the 70 by people
who have died in the Gaza Strip are
women and are Palestinian children that nothing
They have to do with huh with the group
terrorist ever clear one
Difference is interesting what because
is precisely the main
differentiation they make especially
EH detractors of military actions
from Netanyahu and it is good one thing is the
Terrorist group ever with their
Infrastructure with your weapons with your
extremist logic too and another thing is
the civilian population eh in the
Half no if you want to think about those
terms remains between both armies
extremely vulnerable thus Israel
He defended himself in HAA before the accusation
of genocide that is one of the
most recent movements of this war
of this day that permanently
worries in the plane
international
