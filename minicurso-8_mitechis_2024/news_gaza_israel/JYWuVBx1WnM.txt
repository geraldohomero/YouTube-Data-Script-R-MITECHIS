on the fourth night of the war we
watched as israeli artillery launched a
huge attack on gaza
israel later said it was a deception to
make hamas think an invasion was coming
the effect here in beitla here was death
and displacement
there were no telephone warnings here
nasa abu faris tells me about the four
children he lost that evening
they died just a few short steps away
where they'd gathered with the family
on the first day of eid now there are
just reminders here
of lives ended in their teens and
twenties
i saw them i was overwhelmed i fell down
i woke up 15 minutes later i asked what
had happened
they said nothing i went back in and saw
the bodies again
not bodies just pieces all over this
area
incredibly there were also two survivors
a 13 year old girl and an
eight-month-old cousin
abdul rahman's father was first told he
was dead
then that he been transferred to the
main hospital in gaza city
when i found him he was covered in blood
he was sitting in
icu for five hours there was one
fragment in his head
it was serious injury and there was lots
of shrapnel all over his body
but others were killed in separate
blasts this is two doors down from abdul
rahman's house
a 45 year old woman killed on her
stairway we've been seeing morning tents
like this one
being set up pretty much everywhere we
go around gaza usually
they are outside a specific home a
specific family
this one is for an entire neighborhood
the fake invasion was designed to send
hamas
and other fighters into tunnels and
defensive positions
only to be hit by artillery and
airstrikes of massive concentrated power
a military spokesman told me dozens were
believed to be killed
from a distance the landscape around
bethlehem does contain what could be
new damage we could only though see from
a distance
hamas does not allow the open filming of
military installations
still less damaged ones in beit lahir
nasa abu faris insists there was no
military target anywhere near his
devastated street
across the street i asked abdul rahman's
father what he now hopes for
for his son's life peace and safety he
says
as for all children harry fawcett
