the
the unfolding situation after October 7
proves once again that without
addressing the root cause of the Israeli
Palestinian conflict there can be no
peace in the
region Israeli Palestinian conflict did
not start on 7 October
2023 the conflict is not about a certain
Palestinian faction or group the
conflict dates back to an earlier
Century but the real obstacle to peace
is
obvious the deepening occupation by
Israel of the Palestinian territories
including e Jerusalem and failure to
implement the two state
vision Israel and Palestine living side
by
side against Israel concerning
violations of
its tury calls for the full
implementation of the provisional
measures indicated by the
court and we hope the security Council
will uphold its responsibility to
enforce it at least in this critical
conditions in respect of the
Court the Court's advisory opinion on
the current file will remind the
International Community once again of
the legal consequences arising from the
Israeli occupation of the Palestinian
territories including East
Jerusalem and the gravity of the
situation in whole
Palestine Palestinians seek recognition
of their inalienable rights in their own
land and until the same are
amended
this prolonged occupation is an afront
to International Justice the failure to
bring it to an end has led to the
current Horrors perpetrated against the
Palestinian people amounting to
genocide there can be no moral or
juridical justification for occupying
lands killing terrorizing and displacing
their
populations the league of Arab states
stru trusts the esteemed Court will
confirm the illegality of this
occupation and unambiguously rule on the
legal consequences for all parties
especially those who turn a blind eye
facilitate assist or participate in any
way in perpetuating this illegal
situation only the rule of law not the
prevailing law of the Jungle will pave
the way to peace in the whole region
