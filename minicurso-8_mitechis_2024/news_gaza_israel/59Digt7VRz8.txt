all I'm I'm thinking about is my family
how I'm going to help them to go in a
safe place I think it's not easy as
there is a lot of rumors lot of false
news we don't know the truth you don't
know where to
go I'm trying to deal with patients we
have maybe 10 times 10 times the the
capacity of the
hospital uh overloaded with patients 10
times the the beds the people uh
patients are in the the corridors the in
the the streets they are evacuating them
uh because there is no other beds uh any
other casualties come to the hospital
they stay in the emergency department uh
I can't work in here uh uh people
are uh evacuating in a shifa hospital as
it is the only shelter for them uh
beside the United Nation
schools uh we don't have uh normal
shelters now Gaza is announced as a
military
operation ground or something like that
there is uh about uh there's a an
invasion about to happen after White
helping out complete blocks and
neighborhoods from the
map uh the the
even even the the the the air we smell
the the we we breathe is uh contaminated
uh it is full of dust and uh
pomping ashes and dust I hope my
messages are all
delivered I hope the conscience of
good people who can see the real picture
not the
propaganda not the false news not the
claims we are peaceful living people
here we're trying to live ordinary life
we have been in a blockage and siege for
for for decades now we don't have the
basic requirement to
live we try to live in
Gaza but there is no hope now there is
no there's no place to live in
Gaza we are trying to to be
resilience but it is hard here it's so
hard
