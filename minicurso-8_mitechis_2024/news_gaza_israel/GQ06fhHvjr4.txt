The Savage attacks that Hamas
perpetrated against innocent Israelis
are mind-boggling slaughtering families
in their homes massacring hundreds of
young people at an outdoor
Festival kidnapping scores of women
children and elderly even Holocaust
violence Hamas has bound burned and
executed children they are
Savages Hamas is Isis and just as the
forces of civilizations United to defeat
Isis the forces of civilization must
support Israel in defeating
Hamas
if you go back Kamas was created in the
1980s and it's all about creating an
islamist state in all of historic
Palestine because of that Hamas hates
Israel the most but they also don't have
much love for the Palestinian Authority
which is secular and not only is it
secular as opposed to
islamist but it uh believes in a
two-state solution and Hamas does not I
think this is one thing that many
viewers may not understand Hamas is not
fighting for there to be a Palestinian
State alongside an Israeli State Hamas
is fighting to destroy Israel and to
have one Palestinian state that is not
secular but is islamist in all of
historic Palestine in all of Israel and
all the West Bank and all the Gaza STP
so it's against peace in general uh and
that makes it very very
different

Hamas has never carried out an attack
like this before it's been known for
suicide bombings targeting buses and
cafes later when it conquered the Gaza
Strip by force of arms and turned its
guns on fellow Palestinians in 2007
after that because it had Terr territory
it built up a rocket Arsenal and would
fire rockets at Israeli communities
we've seen that even in this attack but
storming into Israel uh uh attacking 30
some 30 civilian communities and a and a
music
festival um killing people on the
streets um abducting hostages and taking
them in the dozens back to Gaza Strip
including little children without their
parents um this is unheard
of
