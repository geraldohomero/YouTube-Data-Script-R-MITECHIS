humanitarian aid for hundreds of
families displaced in the region of Ty
in southern Lebanon since the 7th of
October more than 9,000 people have
flocked to the coastal city providing a
major headache for Tire's disaster
management unit which is working around
the clock to take care of the
influx our first priority is to give all
the displaced a mattress and bed clothes
especially as winter is approaching and
people are starting to feel the cold we
don't have enough covers or pillows
that's our priority with 4 to 500
displaced people arriving daily spaces
at a premium some have tried to return
home but faced with the danger of the
bombings have changed their
minds they go back home for a day or two
but after the bombing of their Village
Sometimes using white phosphorus as was
the case a few days ago they come
back three sco and tire have been
converted into shelters for families
that have nowhere else to
go in these classrooms are stacked
mattresses and some people sleep on the
floor husin from the border Village of B
Liff has been here for more than 2 weeks
he's struggling to adapt to his new
conditions of course when you leave your
village in your home to live in a school
you sense a lot of changes imagine there
being only one toilet for 400 people
there's just one toilet and sometimes
without any water we're
suffering the 2006 war with Israel is on
everyone's Minds many of these displaced
are living through the same thing
again oh yes we went to Beirut and we
suffered a lot but we didn't feel scared
like we are now we're scared because our
conditions are difficult you have sick
people children and Israel is bombing
Israel is a country that has no mercy
for children for trees for Stones this
is what frightens
us for another family the current or
deal is even
worse it's very different in 2006 we
didn't experience what we've gone
through these past few weeks especially
in our village dirra we weren't bombed
with phosphorus the houses weren't badly
damaged with the exception one all eyes
are now on Gaza in the fear that another
war with Israel might break out
