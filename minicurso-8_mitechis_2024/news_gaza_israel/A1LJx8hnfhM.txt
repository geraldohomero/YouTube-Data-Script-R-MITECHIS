>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
WE ARE BEGINNING TO GET MORE 
DETAILS.
THIS IS THE RAFAH CROSSING THAT 
LINKS GAZA WITH EGYPT AND THE 
LATEST HOSTAGES THAT ARE BEING 
ENTERED AND BACK IN TO ISRAEL.
LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM NATE 
FOY WHO CAN TELL US ON HOW THAT 
IS GOING.
NATE?
>> WELL, NEIL, VERY GOOD NEWS TO
PASS ALONG.
THE TEN ISRAELI HOSTAGES ARE IN 
THE HANDS OF THE RED CROSS.
AN AMERICAN IS AMONG THOSE TEN 
HOSTAGES.
AN ISRAELI AMERICAN.
SHE'S 49 YEARS OLD.
KIDNAPPED FROM HER KIBBUTZ WITH 
HER HUSBAND WHO REMAINS IN HAMAS
CAPTIVITY.
WE JUST GOT A PICTURE OF HER.
WE'RE TRYING TO GET THAT PICTURE
PROCESSED.
IF WE CAN, WE'LL PULL IT UP.
SHE'S PART OF THIS GROUP.
YOU MENTIONED THE FOUR THAI 
HOSTAGES AS WELL.
NINE ISRAELI FEMALES ARE 
INCLUDED IN THIS GROUP, 
INCLUDING ONE AS YOUNG AS 13 
YEARS OLD.
FIVE TEENAGERS AS PART OF THIS 
GROUP ALSO THAT IS ON THEIR WAY 
TO ISRAEL RIGHT NOW AFTER 54 
DAYS IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY.
THIS COMES AS WE'RE WAITING TO 
SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW 
WITH THIS ISRAELI WAR CABINET 
MEETING RIGHT NOW TO DISCUSS AS 
I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT OFFER 
BY HAMAS TO EXTEND THE PREVIOUS 
AGREEMENT WITH ADDITIONAL 
HOSTAGES BEING RELEASED WITH 
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS GOING BACK
AND THE PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING 
CONTINUING FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS.
WE'LL SEE EXACTLY WHAT THE 
ISRAEL SAYS ABOUT THAT.
THIS NOW MEANS THAT BETWEEN 
SEVEN AND EIGHT, THOSE ARE THE 
ESTIMATES FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, 
AMERICANS REMAIN IN GAZA WITH 
ONE LESS AMERICAN NOW BEING 
THERE.
SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY 
BLINKEN ARRIVES IN ISRAEL 
TOMORROW AS MORE HUMANITARIAN 
AID CONTINUES TO FUNNEL IN TO 
GAZA.
WE'RE ALL WAITING TO SEE FIRST 
AND FOREMOST THAT THIS NEWEST 
BATCH OF HOSTAGES THAT THEY 
SAFELY ARRIVE IN ISRAEL AND 
REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES.
ALSO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS 
PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING.
RIGHT NOW THAT TRUCE IS SET
