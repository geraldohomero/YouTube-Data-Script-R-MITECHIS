LET'S BRING IN CLINT WATTS ALONG
WITH RETIRED ARMY COLONEL JACK
JACOBS AND BLOOMBERG OPINION
COLUMNIST EDDIE GAUCHE.
CLINT, IF YOU WILL, WILL YOU
GIVE US A BIGGER PICTURE OF
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS REGION
RIGHT NOW AND WHAT WE KNOW IS
HAPPENING TODAY AS FAR AS THIS
BATTLE?
>> YEAH, SO RIGHT WHERE ELLISON
WAS, RIGHT HERE AROUND ASHKELON,
THAT'S ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE
WE'VE STILL SEEN A LOT OF
CONTACT OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS,
SO YOU'VE SEEN SOME FIGHTING
THERE.
THERE WAS REPORTS OF THREE HAMAS
MILITANTS BEING KILLED THERE.
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE'S
SOME MACHINE GUNFIRE THERE
BECAUSE HERE IS THE BORDER, AND
THAT'S EREZ CROSSING.
THAT'S ONE OF THE CROSSINGS
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND GAZA.
SEPARATELY OVER THE LAST 24
HOURS, THE KEY ZONE THAT THE
ISRAELIS HAVE MOVED BACK INTO
AND TAKEN OVER IS HERE RE'IM,
THAT'S WHERE THAT MUSIC
FESTIVAL, THERE'S ANOTHER
KIBBUTZ HERE AND HERE WHERE ALL
OF THE ISRAELI SOLDIERS ARE
GOING INTO FINDING ATROCITIES,
MASS CASUALTY INCIDENTS, KILLING
OF WOMEN, CHILDREN, IT IS A
STARK SCENE.
SO WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT WHAT'S
GOING ON NOW, I THINK EVERYONE'S
LOOKING TO SEE AS THE ISRAELI
MILITARY IS HERE AND DOING THE
CLEARING OPERATIONS, THEY'VE GOT
TO SECURE INSIDE THEIR BORDER
FIRST.
SEPARATELY, WHAT WOULD THEY DO
IF THEY GO INTO FWAGAZA, ALREADY
ARE THE BOMBING CAMPAIGNS WE
HAVE LOTS OF STRIKES AGAINST
WHAT THEY SAY ARE KEY TARGETS
FOR HAMAS.
YOU'RE SEEING SEVERAL MOSQUES
HIT AROUND REFUGEE CAMPS.
THE OTHER THING IS THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT MAY BE
UNFOLDING.
SO DOWN HERE AT THE RAFA
CROSSING, WHICH IS ABOUT IN THIS
AREA.
THERE'S REPORTS OF HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF GAZANS DESPERATELY
TRYING TO MOVE OUT WHILE THE
EGYPTIANS REMAIN STEADFAST IN
KEEPING THAT BORDER CLOSED.
SO RIGHT AROUND GAZA, THAT'S THE
SO RIGHT AROUND GAZA, THAT'S THE
PICTURE THAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW.
I THINK EVERYONE'S WANTING TO
KNOW WILL THERE BE AN OFFENSIVE
OPERATION THAT GOES ON THE
GROUND INTO GAZA.
IT'S AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT, SO
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FIGHTING
UP, FIGHTING ON THE GROUND, AND
MOST IMPORTANTLY HERE FIGHTING
SUBTERRANEAN.
HAMAS HAS BEEN DUG IN IN THIS
AREA ALONG WITH PALESTINIAN,
ISLAMIC JIHAD, FOR A VERY LONG
TIME, SUBTERRANEAN BOOBY TRAPS,
LAND MINES, THAT WILL BE A
QUESTION IF THEY'RE GOING TO
RESCUE HOSTAGES, 150 OR SO
