a warning that this report from our
correspondent Mark Stone contains images
you may find
distressing it is individual moments in
Gaza which reflect the enormity of all
this this is Muhammad alalu in his arms
his little boy kis and he's carrying him
for a final
goodbye Beyond the Door Muhammad's wife
K's mother too injured to leave hospital
and so she will say good bye to her son
here and she will do it four
[Music]
times because kis wasn't alone he died
with three of his siblings ammed Raha
and
Kenan Muhammad lost four of his children
and he lost his three brothers
too and his sister and their children
his whole
family one after the other they are
lifted to be taken for burial this is
what dignity has become in Gaza so much
loss there isn't space in the back his
firstborn will come with
him they were here at home on Saturday
night when the Missile hit like all the
refugee camps here al- maazi is a town
it is in area where they were told by
the Israelis that they would be
safer there are believed to be more
families beneath the
rubble with Muhammad's agreement our
team in Gaza followed him for the burial
a drive that is replicated across this
strip of
land I didn't get a chance to say
goodbye to them he
says he left for work early to film
other people's grief that is now
his
and so the final steps of this
journey into a cemetery already prepared
for so
many and then the rage spills
over he is the man who runs the cemetry
are these Hamas Fighters he shouts are
these Hamas
Commanders
he's speaking in Hebrew the message is
for
Israel God will help us to take our
revenge he says it is a statement that
hints at so many troubles
ahead here now they bury their families
themselves and so side by side together
so many and one family are laid to rest
