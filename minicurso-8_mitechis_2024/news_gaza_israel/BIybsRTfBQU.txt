so president trump you have two minutes
why should
americans trust you over your opponent
to deal with racism did a crime bill
1994 where you call them super predators
african-americans the super predators
and they've never forgotten it they've
never forgotten it jefferson
no sir it's his two minutes so you did
that and they called you super predator
and i'm letting people out of jail now
that
you have treated the african-american
population community you have treated
the black community
about as bad as anybody in this country
you did the 199 and that's why
if you look at the polls i'm doing
better than any republican has done in a
long time
because they saw what you did you call
them super predators
and you've called them worse than that
because you look back at your testimony
over the years you've called them a lot
worse than that as far as the church is
concerned
and as far as the generals are concerned
we just got the support of 200
mil 250 military leaders and generals
total support law enforcement almost
every law enforcement
group in the united states i have
florida i have texas
i have ohio i have every
excuse me portland the sheriff just came
out today and he said i support
president trump i don't think you have
any law enforcement you can't even say
the word law enforcement because if you
say those words
you're going to lose all of your radical
left supporters and why
aren't you saying those words why don't
you say the words law enforcement
because
you know what if they called us in
portland we would put out that fire in a
half an hour but they won't do it
because they're run by radical left
democrats
if you look at chicago if you look at
any place you want to look seattle
they heard we were coming in the
following day and they put up their
hands and we got back seattle
minneapolis we got it back joe because
we believe in law and order but you
don't
the top 10 cities in just about the top
40 cities
are run by democrats and in many cases
radical left and they've got you wrapped
around their finger joe
to a point where you don't want to say
anything about law and order
and i'll tell you what the people of
this country want and demand
law and order and you're afraid to even
say it
