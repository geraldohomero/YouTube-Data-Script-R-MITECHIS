BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO
INTERESTING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT
GREAT REPORTING.
WE WANT TO TURN IT TO NBC NEWS
CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT
RICHARD ENGLE IN JORDAN.
>> Reporter: WE SAW FIRSTHAND
TODAY HOW THE AID OPERATIONS
INTO GAZA ARE WORKING, THESE
AIR DROPS.
WE WERE ON A MILITARY PLANE
THAT LEFT FROM JORDAN, IT FLEW
THROUGH ISRAEL OVER GAZA, AND
DROPPED PALETTES OF FOOD OVER
THE NORTHERN GAZA STRIP, WHICH
IS SEEING THE WORST
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN ALL OF
GAZA.
PEOPLE ARE STARVING TO DEATH
THERE NOW, PARTICULARLY
CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE PEOPLE.
AND FROM WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO
SEE, IT IS HELPFUL.
IT IS HELPING, BUT IT IS NOT
NEARLY ENOUGH.
IT IS FAR TOO SLOW.
VERY LIMITED AMOUNTS OF AID CAN
GET IN.
IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE, AND IT IT
IS EXTRAORDINARILY TIME
CONSUMING.
THE ONE PLANE THAT WE WERE ON
TODAY, THE ROUTE HAD TO BE
CLEARED WITH THE ISRAELIS.
IT INVOLVED A LARGE JORDANIAN
AIR CREW, A VERY PROFESSIONAL
AIR CREW.
IT TOOK THEIR TIME.
THEY HAD TO COORDINATE THE
ROUTE WITH THE ISRAELIS TO MAKE
SURE THERE WAS NO MID-AIR
INCIDENT, THAT THEY WEREN'T
SHOT DOWN.
AND THE KINDS OF ITEMS THAT
THEY'RE ALLOWED BY THE ISRAELIS
TO SEND IN IS LIMITED.
THE PLANES HAVE TO BE
INSPECTED.
IT IS NOT THE KIND OF SOLUTION
THAT WILL PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF
RELIEF THAT GAZA NEEDS RIGHT
NOW.
NOW, PRESIDENT BIDEN IS
EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE LATER
TONIGHT A NEW STEP THAT THE
U.S. MILITARY IS LEADING THE
EFFORT TO OPEN A TEMPORARY
PORT.
THE ISRAELIS WELCOMING THAT
DECISION, DESCRIBING IT AS A
DOCK THAT WOULD ALLOW FAR MORE
AID TO GO INTO GAZA BY SHIP.
THOSE SHIPS LEAVING FROM
CYPRESS.
BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS
GOING TO TAKE WEEKS TO
ESTABLISH AND COULD TAKE MONTHS
TO GET UP AND RUNNING
EFFECTIVELY.
LEAVING THE PEOPLE OF GAZA WITH
A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION, IS
THERE GOING TO BE A CEASEFIRE
SOON, OR ARE THAT GOING TO HAVE
TO CONTINUE TO LIVE AS THEY'RE
TO CONTINUE TO LIVE AS THEY'RE
LIVING RIGHT NOW IN INCREDIBLY
