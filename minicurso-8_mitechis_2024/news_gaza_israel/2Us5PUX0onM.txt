this security camera vision shows an
israeli airstrike hitting gaza's only
covert 19 testing lab and this
a building housing international media
outlets crashing to the ground
attacks like these have the united
nations questioning the legality of
israel's military actions during the
recent conflict
despite israel's claims that many of
these buildings were hosting armed
groups or being used for military
purposes we have not seen evidence in
this regard a special sitting of the un
human rights council heard if israel's
attacks were found to be indiscriminate
and disproportionate it could amount to
war crimes
such strikes
raise serious concerns of israel's
compliance with the principles of this
distinction
and proportionality under international
humanitarian law the council also
discussed a proposal presented by the
organization of islamic cooperation
calling for an international
investigation
the international community has the
responsibility to protect palestinians
we have to come up with
effective instruments to put an end to
israelis impunity
254 palestinians including 66 children
were killed during the day conflict
almost 2 000 people were wounded
this statement from the united nations
is a great one and it gives us more
optimism and hope but we also need more
practical steps on the ground
i lost nine family members and relatives
in the latest israeli escalation such a
statement does not mean anything to me
because it is just talk without any real
action on the ground
the high commissioner also voiced
concerns about hamas rocket attacks
saying the strikes on israel were
indiscriminate and failed to distinguish
between military and civilian targets
