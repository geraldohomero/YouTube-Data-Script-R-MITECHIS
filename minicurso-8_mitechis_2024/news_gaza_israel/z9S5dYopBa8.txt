at 6:15 p.m. a barriage of rockets was
fired by Hamas to
Israel then at 6:59 p.m. a barriage of
around 10 Rockets was fired by Islamic
Jihad from a nearby
Cemetery it was at the time that 6:59
p.m. when there were reports of an
explosion at the alali AL mahani
Hospital in Gaza
City according to our intelligence Kamas
checked the reports understood it was an
Islamic Jihad
rocket that had misfired and decided to
launch a global media campaign to hide
what really
happened they went as far as inflating
the numbers of
casualties they understood with absolute
certainty that that it was a rocket
misfired by Islamic Jihad that damaged
the
hospital analysis of our aial footage
confirms that there was no Direct Hit to
the hospital itself I would want to let
everybody hear the conversation and I
will do the translation in
English I'm telling you this is the
first time that we see missile like this
falling and so that why we are saying it
belongs to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad
what they are saying it belongs to the
PGI it's from us it looks like it who
says this they are saying the the sharp
nail from the missile is local sharp
nail and not like Israeli sharp
nail what are you saying
Abu but God bless it couldn't have been
found another place not the hospital to
explode never mind yes Abu Raji they
shot it from the cemetery behind the
hospital what they shot it coming from
the cemetery behind the madani hospital
and it misfired and fell on them there's
a cemetery behind it yes El mahani is
exactly in the
compound where is it when the in when
when you enter the compound you first
enter the compound compound and don't go
towards the city it's on the right side
of el madani Hospital yes I know
it
