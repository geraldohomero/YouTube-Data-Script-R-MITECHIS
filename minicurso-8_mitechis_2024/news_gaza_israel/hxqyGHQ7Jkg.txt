Israeli soldiers cordon off the entrance
to a settlement outside Jerusalem where
earlier a Palestinian gunman had opened
fire on Israeli guards
this morning we received a call about a
shooting at the hard-r gate
unfortunately three were pronounced dead
one was evacuated in a serious condition
the attacker arrived at the rear
entrance to the Haddad settlement as
security guards for opening a gate to
allow Palestinians to enter Israel for
work
it was at this moment when the gunmen a
father of four who lived in the nearby
Palestinian village of Beit Sulu pulled
out a weapon and began shooting at close
range he was shot dead by security
forces
one the home of the terrorists will be
demolished - the Army has already
cordoned off the village 3 all work
permits for the members of the
terrorists extended family are hereby
revoked this murderous attack is the
result of the systemic incitement by the
Palestinian Authority and I expect
Martin with our bus to condemn it and
not attempt to justify
shooting the Israeli army imposed a
lockdown on the gunman's village it
searched homes and vehicles
Hamas endorsed the attack but stopped
short of taking responsibility for it
Hamas
Hamas presses the operation in Jerusalem
today and considers it a normal reaction
to the crimes of the occupation and to
the continuous occupation of our
Palestinian land and sacred sites
for others it was a day of mourning as
families of the Dead arranged funerals
the attack happens as US President
Donald Trump's Middle East envoy arrived
in Jerusalem to try to revive
israeli-palestinian peace talks
the issue of settlements illegal under
international law is one of the most
contentious issues dividing Israel and
the Palestinians and unless it's
resolved violence like this will likely
go on Christine beautiful like ease TRT
world
