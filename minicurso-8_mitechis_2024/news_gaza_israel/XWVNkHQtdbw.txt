during the pandemic uh the q anon
movement has been
appears to be gaining a lot of followers
can you talk about what you think about
that and what you have to say
to people who are following this
movement right now well i don't know
much about the movement other than i
understand they like me very much
which i appreciate but i don't know much
about the movement
i have heard that it is gaining in
popularity and from what i hear it's
these are people that
when they watch the streets of portland
when they watch what happened in new
york city in just the last six or seven
months but this was starting
even four years ago when i came here
almost four years can you believe it
uh these are people that don't like
seeing
what's going on in places like portland
and places like
chicago and new york and other cities
and states and
i've heard these are people that love
our country and they just don't like
seeing
it so i don't know really anything about
it other than
they do supposedly like me
and they also would like to see
problems in these areas like especially
the areas that we're talking about
go away because there's no reason that
democrats can't run a city
and if they can't we will send in all of
the federal
whether it's troops or law enforcement
whatever they'd like we'll send them in
we'll straighten out their problem in 24
hours or less okay
at the crux of the theory it is this
belief that
you are secretly saving the world from
this satanic
cult of pedophiles and cannibals does
that sound like something
you are behind well i haven't i
haven't heard that but is that supposed
to be a bad thing or a good thing i mean
you know
if if i can help save the world from
problems i'm
willing to do it i'm willing to put
myself out there and we are actually
we're saving the world from a radical
left
philosophy that will destroy this
country
and when this country is gone
the rest of the world would follow the
rest of the world would follow that's
the importance of this country
