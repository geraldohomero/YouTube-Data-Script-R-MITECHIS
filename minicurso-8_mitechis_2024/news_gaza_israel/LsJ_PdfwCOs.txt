israel where there is currently no
ambassador due to the strange relations
between israel and turkey in recent
years this week's visit is expected to
set the groundwork for a practical
rebuilding of relations with discussions
likely on energy tourism as well as
diplomacy in early may turkey's foreign

consider appointing an ambassador
following this visit and it remains to
be seen if that will happen this is jody
