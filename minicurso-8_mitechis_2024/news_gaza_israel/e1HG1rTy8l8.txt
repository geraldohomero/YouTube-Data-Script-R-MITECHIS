>> Dana: BACK NOW WITH A PAIR OF
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS PUSHING 
SEPARATE RESOLUTIONS TO CENSURE 
CONGRESSWOMAN RASHIDA TLAIB FOR 
HER CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS ON 
ISRAEL.
IT IS NOT JUST THE GOP THAT'S 
OUTRAGED AS THE ISRAEL/HAMAS WAR
CONTINUES TO WAGE.
THE DIVIDE WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
SOMETHING WE'RE WATCHING.
CHAD PERGRAM IS LIVE ON CAPITOL 
HILL WITH MORE.
HI, CHAD.
>> GOOD MORNING.
THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS 
FRACTURING DEMOCRATS.
OUTRAGE OVER RASHIDA TLAIB FOR 
POSTING THE INFLAMMATORY TROPE 
FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA.
ISRAELIS VIEW THAT AS A CALL TO 
WIPE THEM OUT.
HOUSE COULD VOTE ON TWO 
RESOLUTIONS TO SANCTION TALIB 
TODAY.
>> SOME DEBATES DON'T HAVE TWO 
SIDES.
THE RIVER TO THE SEA IS THE 
DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL.
SHE HAS A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT 
TO SAY WHATEVER SHE WANTS.
>> PRO-ISRAELI DEMOCRATS ARE 
WRESTLING WITH PROGRESSIVE WHO 
BACK PALESTINIANS.
DIVIDED OVER FETTERMAN'S MOVE TO
STAND WITH ISRAEL.
INDIANA DEMOCRAT ANDRE CARSON 
SAYS TLAIB DESERVES TO BE HEARD.
>> THAT CRITICISM SHOULD NOT GO 
WITHOUT AN ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND
HER POINT OF VIEW AND HER 
POSITION, WHERE SHE COMES FROM.
THE FACT THAT SHE IS 
PALESTINIAN.
THE FACT THAT SHE HAS SEEN 
INJUSTICE AND INEQUITY ON HER 
SIDE.
>> MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN TRIED 
TO CENSURE TLAIB LAST WEEK.
TWO RESOLUTIONS TO CENSURE TLAIB
TODAY.
ONE FROM GREEN AND RICH 
MCCORMICK AFTER THE LATEST 
DUST-UP.
>> GREENE REALIZED SHE WASN'T AS
THOUGHTFUL IN HER RESOLUTION AS 
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
CONGRESSMAN MCCORMICK WAS MUCH 
MORE SO, CAREFUL OF HIS 
LANGUAGE, PROTECTION OF FIRST 
AMENDMENT AND SO WE'LL SEE WHICH
GOES FORWARD AND HOW THEY GO 
FORWARD.
>> NOT TO BE OUTDONE, CALIFORNIA
