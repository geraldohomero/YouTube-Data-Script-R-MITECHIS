 
 UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THIS IS 
 THE CURRENT THREAT THERE'S 
 ALWAYS THREATS ONLINE.
 STUART: YOU CAN'T BAN IT.
 THERE IS A FREE-SPEECH ISSUE, 
 YOU CAN'T BAN THIS.
 >> FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THE LAST
 YOU WEEKS HAVE BEEN EYE-OPENING
 ABOUT WHERE THAT LINE REALLY 
 EXISTS.
 YOU CAN'T BAN THIS.
 ARE YOU CAN DO IS OVERSEE YOUR 
 CHILDREN AND IT IS TOUGHER THAN
 GETTING IT BANNED.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO 
 BAN SOMETHING AND HAVE THEIR 
 KIDS, THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE 
 WORLD WORKS.
 STUART: WAKE-UP CALL FOR DONORS
 AFTER THESE ELITE UNIVERSITIES,
 CORRECT A NUMBER OF DOROTHY -- 
 WEALTHY DONORS POOL THEIR 
 SUPPORT FOR THESE UNIVERSITIES.
 MY QUESTION IS WHAT IMPACT FOR 
 POOLING THE FUNDS ACTUALLY HAVE
 ON THOSE UNIVERSITIES.
 >> WE WILL GET TO SEE BECAUSE 
 FUNDING IS A SPEECH, MONEY IS 
 SPEECH AND THESE DONORS ARE 
 SAYING YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS IN
 MY NAME, JEWISH KIDS WILL NOT 
 BE LOCKED DOWN WHEN BEING 
 THREATENED BY PROTESTERS 
 OUTSIDE IN MY NAME, THEY ARE 
 NOT GOING TO BE TEARING DOWN 
 PICTURES OF KIDNAPPED CHILDREN 
 BEING HELD HOSTAGE.
 THE REAL COMPARISON, THE PEARL 
 HARBOR COMPARISON, IMAGINE IF 
 KKK WAS MARCHING AROUND COLLEGE
 CAMPUSES THREATENING BLACK 
 STUDENTS, AND DONORS DIDN'T DO 
 ANYTHING ABOUT IT, THEY WOULD 
 BE COMPLICIT IN THAT.
 THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.
 WE CONTINUE TO DONATE TO THESE 
 SCHOOLS THAT TREAT JEWISH 
 STUDENTS THIS WAY, MAKE THEM 
 FEEL UNSAFE, NOT LIKE UNSAFE 
 THE WAY WE'VE BEEN USING IT FOR
 THE PAST DECADE, 
 MICRO-AGGRESSION BUT ACTUAL 
 AGGRESSION.
 DONORS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT 
 THEIR MONEY IS COMPLICIT IN 
 THIS.
 IF WE DON'T PULL IT NOW I DON'T
 KNOW WHAT IS SAF
