The German Foreign Minister
Take advantage of a pause on your agenda
diplomat to send a message to
Arab world in an exclusive interview
For DW the minister talked thoroughly with
Our colleague Jafar Abdul Karim about
The war in the Middle East
issue to deal with why Germany
denies supporting fire in
Gaza could not defend himself from terror
rocket constant never leaves
of course every day you want to erase
Israel of the Israel map must protect
its population at the same time together with
Our international partners
We try to do our best so that
people in gaza have safe places
where do not die where they have water
Drinking and
medicines and I expressed it to the government
Israeli on my last visit must be
protect the Gazat√≠
During the visits of the last
weeks German authorities have
repeated the support to Israel that emanates from
A particular historical responsibility
But in the Arab world there are those who affirm
that Germany shields it to
Avoid reporting possible crimes of
war irritates me people
That says that for m sounds a
Absolute relativization of a genocidi
that there has been my country in the world
Nazi regime of Germany is responsible
of the death of 6 million Jews and
of hundreds of thousands of Europeans as
International community we have a
commitment and that is the basis of law
international is the lesson that
We learned from the Second War
World Cup in terms of the future of
Berb conflict said he probably
will need military presence to
protect civilians in the long term
But he didn't want to specify where they would come from
those
Troops to guarantee security
We need responsibility
international is something we know about
The terrible war in the Balkans there
Also the international community
assumed a protective responsibility
because in that situation where
They committed the worst crimes there were no
trust among regional actors
That's what I see there
also
The question now is what countries tell
With the trust of both Palestinians
like
Israelis
