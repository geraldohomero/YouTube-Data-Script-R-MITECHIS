It has turned to the streets there in
Yemen

Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip
And once again we don't talk about the
discord that has generated in the world
whole war that was fought between
Israel and
Palestine and that has led to that during
all this week because from Monday
Until Friday we have followed very
near our signal on the screen
Channel 26 everything that was happening in
Europe with them

and also the pro manifestations
Palestinas right now that
These Palestinian flags happen high
It is in San in the capital no and also
also taking into account the visit of the
President of the United States Joe
Biden Israel not practically
A week by Yemen had
insured that good if states
United got even more in the
conflict were going to react from another
way not really look

It does not happen for the first time, it is eh a
Support sample a muscle not that
It is shown by De Yemen de
support for very important Palestine huh

Among all the countries in the Middle East
Because not only the manifestations in
Support to Palestine took place in this country
