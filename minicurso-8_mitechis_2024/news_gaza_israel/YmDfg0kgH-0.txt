A day like today but in 1947 with the
Holocaust wound still open
United Nations made a decision
historical
Palestine in a Jewish state and a state
Arab
The resolution of the Palestine Committee
It was adopted by 33 votes 13 against and
10 abstentions
a measure that Israelis supported and
Arabs rejected for something that already
They anticipated 75 years ago
Arab would never come and that they believed
Unfair since despite representing a
third of the population the plan gave them
to the Jews almost half of the
territory something that triggered one
of the longest conflicts of our
Times the creation of the state of Israel
and his first war with Palestine with
clashes to thousands of deaths and
Exodus of about 700,000 Palestinians that
They continue to this day without going
Far this Tuesday three young people
Palestinians MU at the hands of the army of
Israeli near Ramala and Hebron
adding to the nearly 150 Palestinians
dead so far this year
[Applause]
This is proof that arrogance
of the occupation does not distinguish between
students or elders there is no respect
For humanity
One situation is that the current
UN Antonio Secretary
Guti√©rrez Tacha of unsustainable
I urge all parties to take action
immediate to reduce tensions and
end the spiral of violence that
wraps the hood occupied in
This day of Palestine we reaffirm
our support to the Palestinian people in their
Search to build a future of peace
justice security and dignity for all
And is that promised Palestinian state
is further from becoming a reality than
Never with more and more loss of
territory since 1947 some NGOs fear
that even completely ends
annexed by Israel all in the middle
of the demands of an investigation
independent about the occupation to
That Israel refuses
