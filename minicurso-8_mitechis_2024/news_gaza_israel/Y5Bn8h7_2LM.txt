Mr
President there is no right to commit
massacres in international
law Israel is perpetrating massacres in
Gaza every single
day for over 10 days now you have
witnessed it killing entire families
bomb
shelters schools hospitals residential
buildings
convoys you have heard it telling people
to heed South to head south of Gaza and
then bomb the
South you have heard and seen it telling
people they had a choice between force
displacement and death and then subject
them to
both it is beyond belief that some still
speak of a right to
self-defense of an occupying power that
has made clear it is seeking blind
Vengeance forced transfer and
annihilation of our
people you will all say civilian lives
should be protected and yet some of you
until now continue being unable to call
for a stop to the assault to call for an
immediate
ceasefire those who cannot or will not
call for a ceasefire will lose any
credibility any Authority and share some
of the responsibility for the
devastation that is occurring
now and what will occur
next and no one should want to be seen
as complicit it in these mass killings
or their
continuation at this Council called for
a ceasefire two days ago and acted
accordingly it would have saved hundreds
of
lives maybe for some saving hundreds of
Palestinian lives is not such an
important objective to
pursue but are you sure that Palestinian
lives are the only ones you would be
saving if you
act we told this councils months ago act
to save lives all
lives you did not hear us then don't
make the same mistake
now Mr
President people are being killed as we
speak a humanitarian
catastrophe of unprecedented proportion
is unfolding in
Gaza live on TV
screens and we heard what Mr Griffith
said a political disaster is
underway and yet the security Council of
the United Nations is unable to say the
only thing that truly
matters stop the bloodshed I repeat stop
the
Bloodshed for those who think they can
avert a humanitarian catastrophy and a
regional spell over while Israel continu
continues bombing and killing
Palestinians think
again the region is united in telling
you it is not possible listen to them
the only way to prevent both is to stop
stop this criminal aggression against
our
people
