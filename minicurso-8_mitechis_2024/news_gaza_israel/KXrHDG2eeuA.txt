goals of our war against
Hamas but even more important to
highlight here today is what these
families told the Prime
Minister and what they told the entire
nation of Israel they asked the Prime
Minister and the nation of Israel to
hold our heads high and to do what must
be done against
Hamas their resilience is our
strength the ones who are aching the
most most are the ones giving us most
strength we are also still recovering
still uncovering rather further examples
of hamasa savagery from the October 7th
Massacre the IDF found evidence of Hamas
produced kidnappers guide now the guide
explains in gruesome detail how Hamas
terrorists should capture and torture
kidnapped
civilians we will show you the recent
the most updated numbers official ones
that we have as you can see over
1,500 Israelis have been killed over
3,500 Israelis
injured and I want to make something
very clear Israel is at war with Hamas
not with the Palestinian people for the
past almost 96 hours we have urged
Palestinians in Gaza to move to the
safer zones in the southern Gaza Strip
where they will receive humanitarian Aid
we see extensive evidence that Hamas is
preventing them from moving and keeping
them In Harm's Way innocent civilians
should not be used as Pawns in this war
it is worth reminding the world that the
innocent civilians in places like
B Fara and many more did not get any
advanced notice before they were were
brutally murdered by Hamas
terrorists I was uh asked yesterday
specifically about the state of
hospitals in the northern Gaza you see
there are 20 hospitals in that area the
IDF says that six hospitals in the
northern Gaza
Strip had decided to independently
evacuate however 14 did not and I urge
you to ask your sources in Gaza why
Hamas is exploiting Palestinians
innocent Palestinians and are using them
as human

safety stay with the times of India for
