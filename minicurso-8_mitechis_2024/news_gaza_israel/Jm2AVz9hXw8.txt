Mr Netanyahu tweeted on Saturday telling
residents of Gaza to leave now because
we will operate forcefully everywhere
where is the idea of where people in
Gaza will go
this is something also that uh we have
been discussing with our counterparts in
Israel and with our counterparts in
Egypt uh and without getting into the
specifics of uh safe passage for
civilians and so forth I will say it's
something that the US government is
seized with in supporting how we do that
operationally uh but the details of that
are something that uh are being
discussed among the the operational
agencies and I don't want to share too
much of that publicly at this time
I understanding is that is not the the
concept of Siege is not something that
in fact is going to be pursued by the
Israeli government but we are Consulting
with the Israeli government about their
actions in this regard and like I said
before to a previous question President
Biden and prime minister Netanyahu had
the opportunity to talk through the
difference between going full bore
against Hamas terrorists uh and how we
distinguish between terrorists and
innocent
civilians

Isel has the right to
defend but it has to be done accordingly
with international law humanitarian
law and some decisions are counter this
the international
law Palestinian Authority is our partner
we don't deal with AAS but yes we
support and we deal and we work together
with the Palestinian
Authority and not all the Palestinian
people are terrorist so a collective
punishment against all
Palestinians will be unfair and
unproductive will be against our
interest and against the interest of the
Peace
