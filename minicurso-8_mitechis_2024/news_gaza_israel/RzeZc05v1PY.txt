criticizing the u.s. decision to
recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital
the Arab League secretary general said
the move could derail peace efforts our
metal gates called on the world's
leaders to reject what he called the US
presidents illegal decision
the decision by the US administration is
in its essence legitimizing the
occupation and admitting and allowing
their stance by force it is a waste of
international legitimacy and the
principles of justice and therefore has
placed he who took the decision in a
state of conflict with the collective
will of the international community
the Palestinian Foreign Minister said
world leaders should recognize the state
of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its
capital and condemned the US move
we expect from you to instruct Arab bloc
at the United Nations to submit a draft
resolution to the UN Security Council
condemned Trump's decision
Jerusalem status lies at the center of
the israeli-palestinian conflict and
Trump's announcement was widely
perceived as siding with Israel the
Israeli prime minister accused European
officials of hypocrisy for criticizing
US president Donald Trump's decision and
itself I ascribe great importance to
Europe while I respect Europe I'm not
prepared to accept a double standard
from it I hear voices from they're
condemning president Trump's historic
statement but I have not heard
condemnation of the Rockets fired at
Israel all the terrible incitement
against it I am not prepared to accept
this hypocrisy and as usual at this
important forum I will present Israel's
truth without fear and with head and
pipe
and now there are fears the Trump's
announcement could damage the US
standing in the Middle East
