Citizens of Israel, we are at war. No operation. No.
This morning, Homs launched a war of war
Murderous against the State of Israel and its citizens We are
In the early morning hours, I was in a Hershey meeting
The defense establishment first ordered the cleanup
The settlements from the terrorists who infiltrated the operation
This is done at the same time as my order to do
Recruiting extensive reserves and returning salt from the gate
The power and scope of the enemy did not know the enemy Pay up
A price he didn't know like I was reading so far
All citizens of Israel follow the instructions carefully
We are the Army Home Front Command Guidelines In the war
And we will win where the citizens of Israel are at war
Not in the operation, not in the rounds of the war this morning. Homs started
In a murderous counterattack The State of Israel and against it
Our citizens have been in this since the morning
I called the defense establishment negligent
First, I tried to clean the floors From the terrorists
This operation takes place in hours
At the same time, I ordered a large reserve
And fight back with the force and scope of the enemy
The enemy will pay a price he did not know
As such, I call on all citizens of Israel
meticulously to the army's instructions for command guidelines The back of the neck
We are at war and we will win it, the citizens of Israel
We're in a war. Not an operation, not a round of war
This morning, Homs launched a patchwork attack Murdered against the state
Israel and its citizens, we have been in this for hours
Early morning that Nessie was impressed by the system
Safety first Clean up the settlements
From the terrorists who infiltrated in this operation is being carried out
At that time, I was ordered to perform a conscription
Extensive reservists and fight back Powerful
And the extent to which the enemy did not know the enemy would pay a price
He didn't know like him. I'm calling for everything
The citizens of Israel obey meticulously To the army's orders
We are at war and we are at war
We'll win it
