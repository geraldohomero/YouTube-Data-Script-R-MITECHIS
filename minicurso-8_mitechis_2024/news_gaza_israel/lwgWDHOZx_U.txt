>> THE LAST THING BEFORE WE GO
>> THE LAST THING BEFORE WE GO
TONIGHT, COMMUNITY HEARTBROKEN,
OUR OWN KELLY COBIELLA TRAVELED
TO MEET WITH FAMILIES FROM THE
KIBBUTZ THAT WAS UNDER ATTACK
FROM HAMAS TERRORISTS.
SHE GIVES US A CLOSER LOOK AT
HOW SOME OF THE CHILDREN ARE
DOING.
>> >> TONIGHT, THE KIDS OF
COUTTS NOW LIVING IN A HOTEL ON
THE DEAD SEA, TRIED TO MAKE
SENSE OF THEIR NEW REALITY.
>> ICE CREAM?
>> NO, CANDY.
>> CANDY, LIKE A LOLLIPOP?
>> BUT BELOW THE SURFACE, THE
HORROR LINGERS.
>> SHE ASKED ME THE BAD PEOPLE,
HAMAS COMING.
>> HOME NO LONGER FEEL SAFE,
AFTER HAMAS TERRORIST STORMED
THEIR SMALL COMMUNITY, KILLING
MORE THAN 50 AND KIDNAPPING
OTHERS.
>> MY SON IS FOUR YEARS OLD,
JUST STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE
TERRACE BODIES THAT HE SAW.
>> FOR VOLUNTEERS LIKE THIS OR
TEACHER SAW HER, THE TRAUMA IS
PLAIN TO SEE.
>> I CAN SEE MANY KIDS NOT
WILLING TO MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR
PARENTS, SPEAKING ABOUT MANY
KINDS OF THINGS, HE WOULD NOT
WANT SMALL CHILDREN TO SPEAK
ABOUT.
>> AND THEN HIS FAMILY HIT FOUR
HOURS IN THEIR SAFE ROOM,
READING ABOUT THE HORRORS ON
THEIR PHONES, LEAVING THE
FATHER OF THREE, CONSIDERING
THE UNTHINKABLE, AT ONE POINT,
I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO KILL
MY OWN KIDS.
>> VERA AND HER TEENAGE
DAUGHTERS CAME FACE TO FACE
WITH THE TEARS.
>> WE JUST SAY TO THEM, PLEASE
DON'T KILL US, PLEASE, WE DON'T
DO NOTHING, DON'T KILL US.
>> THEY SPURRED HER AND HER
DAUGHTERS BUT TOOK HER HUSBAND
AND DAUGHTER'S BOYFRIEND.
>> TOO MUCH SADNESS, TOO MUCH
NOBODY'S CRYING.
NO CONTACT BETWEEN MY HEART AND
MY MIND.
>> A COMMUNITY HEARTBROKEN AND
NUMB.
THEIR CHILDREN, CHANGED
FOREVER.
>> THEY JUST WANT TO BE KITS.
THEY WANT TO BE KIDS AGAIN.
>> BUT FIRST, THEY'LL NEED TO
FIND A WAY TO FEEL SAFE AGAIN.
