The German Parliament the Bundestag
I kept a minute of
silence in memory of the victims of
terrorist attack started on Saturday by
The Islamic militia of never in
Israeli territory the Bundestag has
shown in this way your unit
during a speech given by the
President of the Babel Bass Chamber in the
that the deputies of all forces
German policies stood up
to honor the memory of those who
They lost their lives in the
Attacks the German federal president
Frank Walta Steiner also participated
Together with Israel's ambassador to
Germany Ron
Pror and after that minute of silence in the
bundestag by the victims of the attack of
Never in Israel the German minister an
Elena the Foreign Minister
granted that speech that we want
put in perspective with Carol Guerrero
Carol reiterated what they have already expressed
other members of the German government that
Israel will have the support of Berlin the
time as necessary but in what
Specifically this support is translated
To start Jenny we are talking about
political support Ana Elena Verb what has
made today before the Bundestag is to reiterate
that Germany is next to Israel and
that also supports its right to
Defense also some deputies of the
Bundestag spoke today of support
humanitarian if necessary by
example with medications or even
blood donations if required and
also very important diplomatic support
Germany wants to concentrate its efforts
at two main points first the
liberation of those of all
kidnapped that are ever
And the second point avoid that this
conflict extends throughout the region
For that as you mentioned it
Verb believes that Qatar can play a role
main other important aspect that
Verb mentioned is that she says
Maintain humanitarian aid to
Palestine because you can't punish
The Palestinian population says verb without
however it is an issue that generates
Much debate still here in Germany
Carol Guerrero thank you very much
