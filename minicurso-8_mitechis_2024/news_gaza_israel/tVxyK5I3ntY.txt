If there is nature, then there is no problem Hyderabad

So tell our countrymen
Would like Mahatma Gandhi said that
Palestine is the way of billions
The way the British land is England
French people's land of French people
The land is France, Gandhi said that now
Keep your point by keeping them in the same way
Should and always we have to bear
Tai's and we always believed that
Palestinian is an independent Azad country
It should be and the reality is that the last 80
Year
Israel from there is okur and Palestinian
Those people are sitting on the land and sitting
International Lodge United Nations many
There is resolution that says that OCU
Payer is he cannot use the army
So today you are seeing that in Palestine
With which one lakh in Gaza has so far
How many population of 21 lakh is in Gaza
9 lakh people have become homeless
About 161 thousand buildings have been broken
Hospitals are bombed
Christian hospital bombs it
The third of our Christian religion goes
The church which is a church is bombed
And 5 Haj women in Gaza
Pregnant is pregnant for them
If not, then all this is the problem there
People are doing Janis and we are from Israel
A stamp was also extracted for solid tea
And today the Government of India is also saying that it
Palestine
If it is in the favorite of the country, then it is first
There should be talk that one of the people there
There is no drinking water, they do not have electricity
Should be a corridor first
