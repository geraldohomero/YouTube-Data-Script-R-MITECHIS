YOU WILL REMEMBER, THIS MEETIN
WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LAST WEEK
IN PERSON IN WASHINGTON.
BUT PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU
VERY PUBLICLY CANCELED IT IN A
SHOW OF ANGER WITH THE UNITE
STATES
THAT WAS IN PROTEST TO THE
AMERICAN DECISION TO LET THE
U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION
GO THROUGH WHICH CALLS FOR A
IMMEDIATE CEASE FIRE, SOMETHIN
THE ISRAELIS SAY WILL NOT HAPPEN
UNTIL HAMAS IS DEFEATED AN
UNTIL THE HOSTAGES ARE FREED

LOWER THE TEMPERATURE AFTER WHAT
HAS BEEN A LOT OF FRICTION I

LEAD
THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IS A
MAJOR DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
U.S. AND ISRAEL OVER PLANS T
ATTACK THE CITY OF RAFAH
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT
NETANYAHU SAYS THE ONLY WAY TO
DEFEAT HAMAS IS TO GO INTO RAFAH
ON THE GROUND IN A BIG WAY
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SAY
THAT WILL BE A DISASTER GIVE
THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN A
MILLION PALESTINIAN CIVILIAN
