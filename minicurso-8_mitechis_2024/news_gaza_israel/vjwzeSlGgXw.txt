[CC may contain inaccuracies] We continue to watch the violence and
the fighting that's happening right now.
Where are we at?
How deadly has it been so far?
Well, it's it's the worst attack inside
Israel since the formation of the nation
in 1948.
There's there's there's really no
comparison.
Even the Yom Kippur War happened
essentially on this
the 50th anniversary of it was a
completely different thing.
And it had far fewer casualties inside
Israel.
I mean, right now we're looking at 700
dead, as you said, inside Israel.
Some of them are American.
We don't know exactly how many.
And 370 Palestinians
who have been killed have
both been fighting, I think mostly in
fighting and some in retaliatory
attacks.
Now, anyone who's been following
the conflict over the years knows that,
you know,
when Israel and Gaza get into one of
these, a spat like this, a spat, that's
not a way to put a conflict, a conflict
like this.
Generally, a lot of Palestinian
civilians die.
We have not yet.
I mean, Israel is not quite launched
this level of attacks that it often does
in situations like this.
I think they're quite shocked and not,
you know, planning with their next step
is.
But I would expect the number of
Palestinian deaths to grow quickly and
by a lot.
And this has been called an intelligence
failure for the ages.
How did Israel and U.S.
security and intelligence officials miss
this?
That is a very good question that no
one's been able to answer.
And I think the answer is not going to
be good for Israel's current political
leadership.
It is.
It's hard to find the words for the
level of
failure of this.
I mean, think about it.
There was probably a thousand or at
least several hundred.
The high hundreds is what
the Israeli military said last night of
Palestinian attackers.
I mean, can five people keep a secret?
Not usually.
Can a thousand people keep a secret.
Never.
How they missed it is mystifying.
And it's been exceptionally deadly.
