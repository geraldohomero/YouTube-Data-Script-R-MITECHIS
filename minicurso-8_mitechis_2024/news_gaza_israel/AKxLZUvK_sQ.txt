israeli prime minister benjamin
netanyahu says he was
deterred from flying to the uee through
saudi arabian espace last week because
of the threat of missile fire from
iranian proxies in yemen
netanyahu was scheduled to undertake his
first official visit to the uae
on thursday the trip would have been the
first
by a leader of israel the uae normalized
ties
with israel late with israel last
september making it the first arab
country to sign on to the abraham
accords brokered by former u.s president
donald trump
the deal made the uae only the third
majority out of state
to establish ties with israel following
egypt
in 1979 and jordan in 1994
after the uae bahrain morocco and sudan
also subsequently joined the abraham
accords
however on thursday netanyahu's office
said
it had difficulties coordinating the
flight over jordanian airspace
speaking at a news conference netanyahu
said there had been a misunderstanding
and by the time it was sorted out
he said it was too late to fly
unfortunately my visit to the emirates
wasn't possible because of a
misunderstanding and coordination of our
flights
and the incident that occurred yesterday
at the temple mount
it took many hours to sort out things
with jordan we can fly i can fly over
the skies of jordan
but until this was coordinated the visit
today wasn't possible
netanyahu had hoped to use the audience
with the uae's crown prince to boost his
prospects ahead of the 23rd march
election
the visit could help netanyahu divert
attention from his upcoming corruption
trial
and israeli anger over the economic
fallout from the kobit 19 pandemic
