14 days have passed since Gaz attacked
It has happened and tension which is now in Gulf countries
Hamas is growing too much
On Thursday evening along with attacks on Israel
Many many on Israel to Southern Lebanon
Hamas says missiles in which Hamas says
That 20 missiles are from Hamas
Some have been fired in northern Israel
Homes have been damaged and three citizens
There have also been deals on the other hand for the first time my
Back which is Mediterion in this southern Lebanon
C is there too from Hizbullah
Missile on Israel's Navy Base
What is the damage done
A has not got information but if
See here in southern Lebanon
The most seen from Hizbollah
It is that he is Israel's infrastructure
And destroying the communication system
I have been engaged for the last several days and
Constant CCTV camera and Sarvaas here
Northern boundary of Israel in Dakshin Lebanon
But during the last several decades, Israel
Made it destroyed and believed
It has been the reason for this so that Israeli
Which is exactly all from the army
Or intelligence systems are not on this limit
What is behind me is the area of Israel and
This is here which is constantly Hizbullah and
Which is very much among the Israeli army
Firing is happening among themselves at night
Firing increases very much on Thursday
In the evening, this area is closed for movement
Was given but there was a lot of lack in the day
Comes such stress not being seen in the day
Is Friday
Once again in countries of the entire Gulf
In support of Palestine and Israel and
Demonstrations took place against the US
Thousands of people after Nimaz
Joined and obviously somewhere
Created an atmosphere in Gulf countries
Going against Israel and here
The ruler is a lot of pressure on them from the public
It is increasing that he action against Israel
I support the month and on the other side
Israel is adamant by style and
America has full support of America
The tension in this entire Gulf from him
Ashraf Wani is increasing day by day
Southern Lebanon today
