.
INCHING CLOSER TO SHUTTING DOWN.
AS OF SUNDAY, THE HOSPITAL
WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT CARDIAC OR
STROKE PATIENTS. AND BY JULY,
THEY PLAN ON CLOSING ALTOGETHER.
AT HOW THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT
LOWER MANHATTAN, WHICH HAS
ALREADY LOST TWO OTHER
HOSPITALS.
WITHOUT WARNING, I SUFFERED A
REAL STROKE. I ACTUALLY WALKED
TO THIS EMERGENCY ROOM. IF I
HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO WALK TO AN
EMERGENCY ROOM IN THAT
SITUATION, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
DIED.
RICHARD TURIN LIVES IN
GRAMERCY AND YEARS AGO, BETH
ISRAEL HOSPITAL, HERE ON THE
CORNER OF FIRST AVENUE AND 16TH
STREET, SAVED HIS LIFE. BUT
BEGINNING THIS SUNDAY, THE
HOSPITAL WILL DISCONTINUE STROKE
AND CARDIAC SERVICES AS MOUNT
SINAI MOVES TO SHUT THE HOSPITAL
DOWN. COMMUNITY MEMBERS SAY IT
IS A MOVE THAT WILL COST LIVES.
THIS IS A COMPLETE
CATASTROPHE ACROSS THE STREET AS
A COMMUNITY OF 25 TO 30,000
PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM USE THIS
HOSPITAL.
MOUNT SINAI ANNOUNCEMENT OF
SHUTTING DOWN STROKE AND CARDIAC
SERVICES COMES DESPITE A
RESTRAINING ORDER ISSUED BY A
JUDGE LAST MONTH DIRECTING IT
NOT TO SHUT SERVICES DOWN
WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM THE COURT
AND HEALTH OFFICIALS, THE STATE
HEALTH DEPARTMENT TELLS FOX FIVE
ON THE HOSPITAL'S OPERATING
CERTIFICATE, EVEN THOUGH MOUNT
SINAI IS LETTING THE
CERTIFICATIONS EXPIRE. NOW
HERE'S THE TRICKY PART MOUNT
SINAI SAYS THEY'RE CLOSING THESE
SERVICES ON SUNDAY BECAUSE THEY
CAN'T KEEP THAT DEPARTMENT
STAFFED. BUT OTHERS SAY IT'S
A SELF-MANUFACTURED PROBLEM,
THAT MOUNT SINAI HAS ITSELF
TRANSFERRED PEOPLE OUT AND
NOT REPLACED THEM.
>> PHYSICIANS BEING
TRANSFERRED AND DEPARTMENTS
BEING CLOSED. IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE CLOSING THE HOSPITAL
WITHOUT REALLY HAVING THE
FORMAL APPROVAL TO DO SO.
WITH SAINT VINCENT'S
HOSPITAL, LONG GONE, COMMUNITY
MEMBERS SAY LOSING BETH ISRAEL
WILL DEVASTATE A LARGE SECTION
OF LOWER MANHATTAN.
WE'RE ABOUT TO LOSE THE LAST
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL FOR MUCH OF
LOWER MANHATTAN, ON CANAL STREET
TO 23RD STREET, RIVER TO RIVER
WITH 300,000 PEOPLE WITHOUT A
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL.
IN THE MEANTIME, RESIDENTS
ARE DEMANDING THE STATE TO STEP
IN AND SAVE THEIR HOSPITAL,
SAYING THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE
THE PROPERTY BECOME LIKE. SAINT
VINCENT'S BECAME DEVELOPED AS
LUXURY CONDOS AT THE EXPENSE OF
