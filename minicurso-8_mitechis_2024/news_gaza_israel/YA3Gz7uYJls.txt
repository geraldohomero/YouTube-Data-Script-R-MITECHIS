I want a book
You guys are bringing in the terrorists
Clothes and water, clothes of dolls
And turned those girls upside down Their dolls are dolls
The humidity that you can do with when you want
They want it and it’s unbelievable that they still do

Yesterday was one of the most difficult days since the outbreak
The war is us
We lost 24 of our best
The heroes who fell on You were protecting
The homeland, together with all the citizens of Israel, I mourn
Every single one
Which I embrace
The families whose world has changed
We pray here for peace forever
A wounded man is examining a thorough examination of the disaster
We have to learn to do everything
For peace
Our fighters are in the midst of a war that does not exist
You're right. This war has great achievements
Including today's steam completion Parking lots, though
There are also very high prices that we charge
Head for the fallen, yet not for a moment
Stop striving for a destination that is not You got him a replacement
The victory
Together we will fight and with God’s help
[Music]
We win
