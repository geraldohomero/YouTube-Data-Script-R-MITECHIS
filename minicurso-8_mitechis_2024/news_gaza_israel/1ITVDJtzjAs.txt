The Gaza and Israel strip dawned
calmly on Friday a
tall to fire that ended eleven days
of clashes between the government
Israelí and Hamás a movement
considered terrorist by the State
Hebrew the European Union and the US
UN Antonio Secretary
Guterres congratulated Egypt and Qatar for
their role in extra negotiations
I emphasize that leaders
Israelis and Palestinians have the
responsibility beyond
restoration of the calm of starting
a serious dialogue that addresses the causes
deep conflict at home is a
integral part of the future state
Palestine and should not be spared
efforts to achieve a real
national reconciliation that ends with
The division in Jerusalem reactions
They will be relieved but also caution
And I think a high fire is good
both sides will be more relaxed will be
quieter and both sides want
is calm in my opinion is a good
Decision but I hope I never come back
to counterattack in 1 or 2 years and let's return
Let's see the same story
I hope you keep calm
I hope the situation improves
tourism that the country opens and that peace
There is no difference between a
Arab and a Jewish there are for example Jews
of extreme right those who like
create problems and we too
We have good and bad people we want
Things are resolved in a way
friendly that people begin to
come together and that peace prevails
Despite the truce on Friday there was
Some clashes between Palestinians
and Israeli police on the esplanade of
The mosques two weeks after
Similar events will lead to climbing
of violence according to the authorities
Gazati air bombings and
Artillery shots in the enclave
For 11 days they caused the death of
two hundred Palestinians and left
almost 2,000 injured in Israel the police
He informed that the Palestinian rockets
They killed a dozen people and
