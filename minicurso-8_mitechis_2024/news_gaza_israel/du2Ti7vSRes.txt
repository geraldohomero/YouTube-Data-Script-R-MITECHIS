The short light of hope of a truce
In the war in the Gaza Strip
seems to dissipate Sylvain again
negotiations in Egypt would not have
allowed to overcome blockages for
The moment in any case there was a
certain enthusiasm during the 48
Last hours I would tell you on a
resumed and to speak it was happening at
It in Egypt there was this this
Discussion on the phone also between the
President Biden last Thursday and the
Prime Minister Netanahou Uh and everything
So that would have accelerated
Indirect contacts because Israel
And Hamas do not negotiate live
But of course through intermediaries of
each on their side there are these
manifestations every night now
in Israel to put pressure for
release the remaining hostages it was
almost 130 less likely a
thirties who would have already died but
anyway we want these releases there and
We even ask Benjamin's resignation
Netanahou negotiations would be in
lessons but but we don't get along on
the kind to stop fire a
partial fire pending release from
hostages or a permanent fire
As the Hamas is claiming it is all that
So who is currently in the
balance but still no
The moment in any case we will take a
2-day break on this while
Humanitarian aid could also
start entering more anyway
under pressure from the United States of
allies of Israel and Sylvain the
government still maintains its
land offensive projects on
City of Rafa last big city in
done there that was not really there I
You would say practically destroyed by
the army of the army on the ground there which
would we get preparing for that the army is
ready and it's been weeks since
Benjamin Netaniaou says it's the last
Pocket You have to go Hamas is
refugee there are the last so
Hamas contingent on the other hand we have
released the city of Canyounes a little at
North of Rafa and people return
and finds the extent of the damage
obviously when there is still one
House that stands up see in which
state for several of them is the
most total disaster we are therefore
in this sector there the army which retires
And therefore concentrates it is finally the
preparation of a possible attack on
The city of Rafa that the United States
Of course to avoid but Benamin n has
been clear it will be necessary to go thank you
Many sylvainoir goodbye
