Thai Farm Workers were on the front line
of the assault by
Hamas part of the engine of the Israeli
agricultural economy seen here looking
terrified trying to
hide at least 39 were killed and at
least 26 tied citizens are being held
hostage the second largest group of
victims after
Israelis thousands of miles away among
the fields of Northeastern
Thailand buaran is desperately waiting
for news about her daughter
yo my sadness is Indescribable and I
pray every day for my daughter's
return she believes this video shows her
daughter caring in a
truck what do you know about the last
time yo was seen
alive there were four Hamas militants
shooting and yo got scared and cried out
so Hamas knew they were there and yo and
her boyfriend were taken away do you
believe yo is still
alive I believe yo is still being kept
in a tunnel and though she might be and
will I really believe she's alive but
buaran fears Thai hostages who left the
rural heartlands of their home to raise
money for their families are being
forgotten
about how do you feel seeing other
hostages released but not yet your
daughter on hoping that Y and other ties
will be among those released I will keep
on hoping do you think the thae hostages
are getting the attention they need and
deserve I want the authorities to give
me more updates and information
everything is so
uncertain nothing clear is coming from
them we were told to wait for so long
but this is long enough we've been
waiting too
long it is hard to shed light on
delicate and ongoing
talks but a negotiator for the Thai
government recently said they'd been
assured all thae hostages in Gaza are
safe and will be released soon when that
day may come is still unclear Cordia
