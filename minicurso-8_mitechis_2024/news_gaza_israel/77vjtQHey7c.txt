.
THEY DON'T KNOW.
>> Marcia: I WANT TO BRING IN 
CTV AVIATION SPECIALIST PHIL 
DIRDY.
GOOD MORNING.
HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS 
OUTAGE WAS ALL ABOUT AND WHY IT
LED TO THE DELAY OF SO MANY 
FLIGHTS?
>> GOOD MORNING, MARCIA.
WHAT HAPPENED THE NOTEM
SYSTEM 
WENT DOWN.
IT'S IMPORTANT WHERE CRITICAL 
INFORMATION THAT THE PILOTS 
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR TRIP.
FOR INSTANCE, I PRINTED OFF TWO
PAGES WORTH JUST FOR TORONTO.
IF THERE'S CRANES IN THE AREA, 
IF RUNWAYS ARE CLOSED, IF 
TAXIWAYS ARE CLOSED, IF THEY 
PUT CHEMICALS ON THE RUNWAY.
ALL THESE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT
THE PILOTS NEED TO KNOW BEFORE 
THEY LEAVE.
>> Marcia: WHAT COULD HAVE 
CAUSED THIS OUTAGE?
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
>> IT SEEMS TO BE A COMPUTER 
GLITCH AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM 
YEAHED.
SO THEY'RE WORKING FEVERISHLY 
TO GET IT BACK UP AND RUNNING.
THINGS ARE STARTING TO MOVE 
AGAIN SO THE NOTAM
s ARE 
STARTING TO COME OUT.
THE PILOTS THAT ARE EN ROUTE 
ALREADY, IF THE NOTAMs ARE 
DOWN, THE AIR TRAFFIC 
CONTROLLERS CAN RELAY THE 
INFORMATION TO THE PILOTS ABOUT
THEIR DESTINATION.
>> Marcia: DO WE USE A SIMILAR 
SYSTEM TO NOTAM IN CANADA?
>> EXACTLY THE SAME THING. 
YOU CAN GET ALL YOUR 
INFORMATION OFF OF THE WEB SITE
AND OFF OF THAT SYSTEM.
>> Marcia: WHAT ARE YOU SEEING 
ABOUT FLIGHTS IN CANADA BEING 
AFFECTED BY THIS?
>> WELL, THE CANADIAN SYSTEM 
ISN'T AFFECTED.
THE FLIGHTS GOING INTO THE 
UNITED STATES.
THE FAA
SYSTEM SO ANY FLIGHT 
BOUND FOR THE STATES LIKE RIGHT
NOW THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
FLIGHTS GOING DOWN TO FLORIDA, 
TO NEW YORK, CHICAGO, SOME 
GOING TO L.A.
SO THOSE FLIGHT ALSO BE DELAYED
UNTIL THEY CAN GET THE PROPER 
NOTAMs UP AND RUNNING.
>> Marcia: IT SEEMS AS THOUGH 
WE CAN'T GET A FIRM GRIP ON HOW
LONG THE IMPACT, THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WILL LAST.
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A
RIPPLE EFFECT.
WHAT'S YOUR BEST GUESS?
>> THAT'S THE THING.
A RIPPLE EFFECT.
SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE TAKING 
DELAYS.
THEY SHOULD -- THEY SAID THEY 
WOULD HAVE IT UP AND RUNNING BY
9:00 A.M. THIS MORNING HALF AN 
HOUR AGO.
THINGS ARE SLOWLY STARTING TO 
MOVE.
THE PILOTS CAN GET AIRBORNE 
AGAIN AND YOU
