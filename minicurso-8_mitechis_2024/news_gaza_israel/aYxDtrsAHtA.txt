it was a major battle in this
kibud uh we understand that local
security the Jets above us here we
understand that local security had to
fight the
Hamas gunmen as they came across the
border into here but they were 17 hours
before any help arrived just talking to
one of the soldiers asking him how many
civilians died he said we just don't
know but it was an awful lot of people
and they're
still going house to
house they're not talking to us they're
still going house to house looking
for booby traps we just came across a
grenade that was behind um a children's
play uh
area um this is really I mean on the
border with Gazo so it's one of the
first kerts to be attacked and as I say
I think this is one of the issu isues
that shock so many people here is how
long it took uh for help to arrive and
these people were pretty much on their
own I mean so the kabut you look at the
houses they're sort of
like you know brick buildings but very
light brick and obviously they couldn't
they they locked themselves inside but
they
uh they couldn't really uh protect
themselves in any meaningful way so it
was it was Carnage and it it lasted a
very long time soldiers are now here
obviously in large numbers but it's
probably because of its position so near
to the front line that if there is going
to be an
incursion it's going to come across from
areas like
this the uh Army of or the Defense
Forces have a well organized plans for
entering into Gaza and they often follow
similar routes which is dangerous of
course because Hamas know the way they
go as it stands now they are securing
this area
still as I say the Jets the drones
helicopters are in the sky all the time
the Iron Dome that's a defensive Shield
we've seen taking out missiles so
they're still striking into this
area another massive
explosion it's always difficult when
you're in these sort of environments to
know exactly uh what is happening you
have to take your guidance from the Army
yeah if they s explaining hit the ground
yeah lot of yeah bombs and
everything as you can hear as you can
see
it's a a very active military
zone and as the government has said for
a long time or since Saturday this is a
war and it's going to go on for a very
long time
