bird song accompanied by artillery fire
is the sound of the morning in
Gaza Israeli air strikes followed by
intense fighting on the ground have laid
waste to entire communities this was the
scene at Nassar Hospital in southern
Gaza early on Tuesday it's one of the
medical facilities still functioning and
it's where these children were brought
on Monday following an Israeli air
strike on several houses
nearby US President Joe Biden was asked
about the situation facing elifa
Hospital in Northern Gaza the facility
the wh says is nearly a cemeter is my
hope and expectation that uh there will
be
uh
less intrusive action relative to the
hospital we're in contact and with with
the Israelis also there is an effort to
uh uh take this pause to deal with the
release of prisoners and that's being
negotiated as well with the cutter are
engaged and uh so I remain somewhat
hopeful but the hospital must be
protected I want you to see the Israeli
military is adamant Hamas is using
medical facilities for military
purposes it released this footage that
it says was filmed in the basement of a
children's hospital making claims that
are impossible to verify and which
Medics deny underneath the
hospital in the basement we found a
Hamas command and control control center
suicide bomb vests grenades
AK47 assault rifles explosive devices
RPGs and other weapons computers money
Etc and we also found signs that
indicate that Hamas held hostages here
late on Monday Hamas said it's willing
to release up to 70 of those hostages
women and children in return for a 5-day
TR Israeli leaders have so far insisted
there will be no broad ceasefire before
every captive is
released and on Tuesday an Israeli air
strike targeted the Hamas run Ministry
of Communications in Gaza
City the sound of gunfire continued
throughout the day as further to the
north in the jabalia refugee camp people
tried to reach survivors of an Israeli
air strike the closest medical center is
the Indonesian Hospital which is already
crippled doctors say many patients surv
survive the fighting only to die in
places where they should be safe clet TT
