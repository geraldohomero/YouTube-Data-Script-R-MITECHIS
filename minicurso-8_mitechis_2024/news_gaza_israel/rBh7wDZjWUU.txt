 
>> POLICE ARE ASKING FOR HELP 
FINDING THE SUSPECT. 
>>> A NAVY DESTROYER IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST SHUT DOWN DRONES IN 
YEMEN. USS CARNEY REPORTEDLY 
INTERCEPTED THEM FROM ITS 
POSITION IN THE NORTHERN RED SEA
. THE PENTAGON SAYS THE MISSILES
WERE POTENTIALLY HEADING TOWARD 
ISRAEL. 
IT HAS NOT FINISHED ITS 
ASSESSMENT. 
A RETIRED MARINE COLONEL AT THE 
CENTER FOR MARINE STUDIES JOINS 
US NOW. 
COLONEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
BEING WITH US. 
THESE ARE THE FIRST SHOTS FIRED 
SINCE THE WAR BROKE OUT TWO 
WEEKS AGO. 
WHY IS THAT SIGNIFICANT? 
>> IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE 
WHAT WE ARE SEEING, HAMAS WANTS 
TO MAKE THIS A REGIONAL WAR, 
NOT JUST ISOLATED. THEY ARE 
TRYING TO BRING IN OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
THEY HAVE ALIGNED WITH IRAN AND 
THE FACT THAT THEY SHOT IT DOWN 
SHOWS THAT THEY ARE WORKING TO 
PROTECT ISRAEL OUTSIDE OF THE 
BORDERS. WE HAVE SEEN ATTACKS 
ON U.S. BASES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA 
WITH THE SAME RESPONSES. 
>> THE U.S. HAS SENT ASSETS TO 
THE MIDDLE EAST FOR THIS 
REGION. 
IS THERE A CONCERN IT COULD GET 
PULLED INTO FIGHTING WITH 
ISRAEL AND GAZA? 
>> THE U.S. IS UNLIKELY TO GET 
INVOLVED. 
ISRAEL HAS NOT ASKED FOR U.S. 
BOOTS ON THE GROUND. 
THE U.S. HAS NEVER SENT BOOTS 
ON THE GROUND FOR WAR. WE HAVE 
PROVIDED MILITARY SUPPLIES, 
DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT, AND MOVING 
FORCES TO DETER EFFORTS BY 
OTHER COUNTRIES TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION. 
IT BECAME A REGIONAL WAR WHERE 
COUNTRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE 
ATTACKING U.S. FORCES AND THAT 
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT SITUATION 
BUT FORTUNATELY, WE ARE NOT 
THERE QUITE YET. 
>> THE U.S. IS CALLING ON 
CIVILIANS TO BE PROTECTED. 
I WONDER REALISTICALLY WHAT YOU 
THINK THE EFFECT OF THAT CALL 
MIGHT BE. 
>> WELL, IT IS CERTAINLY WORTH 
ADVISING THE ISRAELIS ABOUT 
THAT BECAUSE THE WORLD IS 
WATCHING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
GAZA. WE ARE SUPPLYING THEM 
WITH SOME EQUIPMENT THAT WILL 
AT LEAST LIMIT CIVILIAN 
CASUALTIES. BOMBS WITH SMALLER 
WARHEADS. I'M SURE WE ARE 
SUPPLYING INTELLIGENCE AND 
OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT HELP 
WITH THE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, 
BUT WHEN YOU ARE FIGHTING LIKE 
THIS, THERE IS NO WAY TO AVOID 
DESTRUCTION AND COLLATERAL 
DAMAGE O
