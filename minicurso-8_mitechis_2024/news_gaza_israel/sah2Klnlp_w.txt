HOLDING ANOTHER VIRTUAL MEETING
TODAY TO DISCUSS A POSSIBLE
GROUND OFFENSIVE IN RAFAH.
TWO U.S. OFFICIALS TELL NBC
NEWS THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO AN
INTENSE MEETING HELD BACK ON
APRIL 1st, WHICH LED TO AN
ISRAELI OFFICIAL YELLING IN
DEFENSE OF THEIR PLAN.
THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED A NEW
ROUND OF SANCTIONS AGAINST
IRAN.
MEANWHILE AS WE WAIT TO SEE
ISRAEL'S RESPONSE TO IRAN'S
DRONE AND MISSILE ATTACKS, WE
ARE GETTING AN EXCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW WITH HEZBOLLAH'S
SECOND IN COMMAND.
DESIGNATED BY THE UNITED STATES
AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
HE SPOKE EXCLUSIVELY WITH NBC
NEWS INTERNATIONAL
CORRESPONDENT MATT BRADLEY.
YOU FIRST SPOKE WITH HIM IN
NOVEMBER AND HE WARNED ABOUT
THIS EXPANDING CONFLICT.
WHAT IS HE SAYING NOW?
>> Reporter: ZINHLE, EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.
THE ENTIRE REGION IS WAITING TO
SEE HOW ISRAEL RESPONDS TO
THOSE MISSILES, 300 OF THEM AND
DRONES FIRED IN AN
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON
SATURDAY NIGHT.
WE SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THAT AND SOME OF THE ESCALATION
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THE
BORDER BETWEEN SOUTHERN
LEBANON, WHICH IS JUST WAY OFF
DOWN BY LEFT SHOULDER PAST
WHERE THOSE LIGHTS ARE, AND
NORTHERN ISRAEL.
10s OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE
EVACUATED FROM BOTH SIDES OF
THAT BORDER.
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
KILLED IN FIGHTING, AND STILL
SOMEHOW KIND OF CONTROLLED.
HE WARNED THAT IF ISRAEL
ESCALATES, THEN HEZBOLLAH WILL
ESCALATE, BUT HE SAID THAT
HEZBOLLAH LIKE IRAN ITSELF WAS
DONE TRYING TO RETALIATE, AND
THEY WERE GOING TO BE KIND OF
WAITING FOR THE NEXT STEP.
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.
>> WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING
ISRAEL'S ATTACK TO BE?

>> YOU THINK ISRAEL DOESN'T
HAVE A PLAN RIGHT NOW?
>> [SPEAKING GLOBAL LANGUAGE]

>> DO YOU THINK THEY'RE SCARED?
>> [SPEAKING GLOBAL LANGUAGE
>> Reporter: SO, HEZBOLLAH,
THIS MAN'S ORGANIZATION IS
IRAN'S MAIN CAT'S PAGANS ISRAEL
