you know that as a general matter we
don't offer public comprehensive
evaluations
of reports by outside groups
it may be true that you don't offer
public comprehensive evaluations of
outside reports
but you certainly cite them quite a bit
uh in your own human rights report and i
went back and looked and you know when
in terms of just the last human rights
report cited amnesty international on
ethiopia and cuba on china and xinjiang
on iran
on burma
on syria
on cuba
and that those
references
are endorsements of what
the
this group amnesty and then other groups
as well that are cited as have found
why is it that without
taking a stand or making a judgment
about
the findings of this particular report
why is it that
all
criticism of israel is but from these
groups is is almost always rejected by
the u.s and yet
accepted welcomed and endorsed
when it comes when when it comes out
when the criticism is is of other
countries notably countries with which
you have significant policy differences
matt i would make a couple points number
one when we include a footnote in
something like these are footnotes ned
these are when we
which
it's a game of semantics i suppose but
whether you call it a citation or a
footnote well when it says in the report
amnesty international found this
x
in
xinjiang with the uyghurs and we think
and and and we determine that we we
think that it's a genocide and you guys
come out and cite that and say well we
also agree that it's that is a far cry
mat
comprehensive agreement with a
third-party report that was produced by
another one so it's just when it's
criticism of israel that you feel free
to disagree where have you ever
disagreed with an amnesty report or a
human rights report on a country such as
iran this is not matt this is this is
not about any outside group uh this is
about our vehement disagreement with a
certain finding in a report by an
outside group
there are plenty of times where
we cite as you said outside groups in
our own reports we cite the facts that
they have uncovered that they have put
forward but i don't think you're going
to find any citation in any state
department document uh and i don't think
i'll regret saying this it says the
department agrees on a comprehensive
basis with absolutely everything that's
in this report
