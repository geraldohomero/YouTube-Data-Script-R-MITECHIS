There have been many trips to Israel before this
pulling
into
the right now, thanks
to our volunteer driver.
But this trip,
so it certainly feels like we've been traveling forever and it also
feels like we've been on the ground here in Israel forever.
This trip can't be compared to any other for Rabbi Menachem
Lafi. It's actually just a busy day today. It's been one of the most
intense days I think
in my entire life,
he's leading a group of dozens of volunteers with the organization.
H
we brought about 20 duffel bags of
supplies that have already gone to the army bases and arrived in Israel
this week to volunteer where needed making
thousands of sandwiches for Israeli soldiers.
There was another section of people who were writing notes
including a lot of Children and teenagers that were there.
It's not enough just to give them the sandwich, they had to give them the sandwich
with the note. And that was really
heartfelt and beautiful
and visiting with families who lost their homes and loved ones.
So these are families who live near the Gaza border who had to evacuate
after October 7th, Rabbi Lair
Feld won't forget a conversation with a widow left with
five Children whose husband was killed by Hamas terrorists.
Hard to imagine that that's
her frame of mind is not
self pity and thinking how terrible the situation is. But
it's an unwavering faith that this will end soon,
that they'll be able to go back to their homes and that once they do,
they're gonna rebuild and the community is gonna be bigger
and stronger
and greater.
No,
this is unlike any trip he and the other volunteers have
ever taken to Israel and talk about highs and lows.
And
the truth is like, that's the Jewish story,
but it's one this group knew they had to
make our very presence being here on the ground
has been
to them. So, so moving and so inspiring
and
personally, that's made it all worthwhile.
