October suffered as the rest of the
Communities near the Gaza Strip

had personally afraid of what
It happens here in the country but this time it goes
far beyond what it is is like that
This was far beyond what
It may be a war between one and
another because here what was about
to do is kill people and then it's
Like that today I feel sometimes afraid of
walk in my own kibs in my own
house I sao that I never thought I could
reach
Gaza Strip is very close
approximately 1.7 km and rockets
They take to arrive between 7 and 8 seconds
There are several shelters located in the
immediate but several points of
these stables and have suffered damage and have
been affected by the shrapnel

No type of possibility must
directly eliminate them do not have to
exist more they sought to exterminate

There was no military base there was no
No only civilian soldier searched
