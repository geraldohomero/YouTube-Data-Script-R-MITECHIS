a morning raid at al-aqsa as thousands
of people had gathered for ramadan
prayers according to eyewitnesses
israeli police entered the mosque
compound saying they wanted to preempt
any violence
i was there when the clashes happened we
were all worshiping inside the mosque
and the israelis are the ones who
attacked first our people were already
prepared to confront them
but israeli authorities say palestinian
youth struck first
hurling stones at the officers
dozens of worshippers have been injured
by rubber bullets stand grenades and
buttons
hundreds have been arrested
turkey has condemned israel's actions as
unacceptable saying it is concerned by
the increase in tensions in recent days
in a statement the foreign ministry has
emphasized the importance of protecting
the status of al-aqsa mosque especially
during this sensitive period
palestinians viewed the deployment of
israeli forces at the compound as a
serious provocation
last year weeks of protests and raids at
al-aqsa during ramadan escalated into an
11 day assault on besieged gaza
this year the muslim holy month
coincides with the jewish passover of
east and the christian is the weekend
we are in the month of ramadan and the
israelis must give consideration to this
holy month and avoid any provocative
actions israel has signaled a desire to
de-escalate tensions but with an
accompanying warning
we are working to count things on temple
mount and throughout israel at the same
time we are prepared for any scenario
but its assurances appear to contradict
footage of the attacks at the entrance
of the mosque and the explosions inside
by early afternoon the situation had
returned to normal but normal is an
israeli occupation that dates back to
1967 and for palestinians as long as
israeli boots are on the ground in
occupied jerusalem any count that
prevails will always be undermined by
the threat of violence most of what is
world occupying jerusalem
