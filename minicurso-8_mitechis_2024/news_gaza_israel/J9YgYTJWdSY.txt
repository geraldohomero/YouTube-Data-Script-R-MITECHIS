OF THE WORLD CUP, QATAR'S HUMAN
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS WERE THE
SUBJECT OF A DEBATE IN THE
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT.
ONE MEMBER'S SPEECH STOOD OUT.
>> TODAY THE WORLD CUP IN QATAR
IS PROOF ACTUALLY OF HOW SPORTS
DIPLOMACY CAN ACHIEVE HISTORICAL
TRANSFORMATION OF A COUNTRY.
>> Reporter: A GREEK LAW MAKER
NOT ONLY PRAISED ITS REFORMS AND
WARNED AGAINST THE EU LECTURING
THE ARAB COUNTRY.
>> THEY ARE GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND
PARTNERS.
WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER TO
OVERCOME THE SHORTCOMINGS.
THEY ACHIEVED THE IMPOSSIBLE
ALREADY.
THANK YOU.

RELEASED A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE

THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS HAD BEEN

HAVE DENIED ANY WRONGDOING,
WHILE THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
PRESIDENT VOWED TO TACKLE

WILL GO, BUT WHAT I CAN SAY I
FEAR AND THIS IS IN A GENERAL
POINT OF VIEW AFTER OUR INITIAL
FINDINGS IS THAT THE STORY WILL
NOT STOP HERE.
