Sauce was entering home when
He felt a strong impact on his head
The bullet came from the south crossed the
Metal roof He registered here
The Israeli army projectile is the
first that reaches the mass villages
Fair is after May the Supreme
from Israel will ratify it a shooting zone
Palestinians have lived here for
generations but as Israel does not
recognizes today not only face a
imminent eviction but coexist with
military exercises and harassment
Jews of illegal settlements
surrounding
Once the settlers came at night
And they set fire to hay too
They burned the fields where they usually pass
Our sheep that included about 300
olive trees and almond trees
Saud and his family subsist what
cultivate and the challenge of being and the earth
It is added that the authorities have
shattered orchards seized tanks of
water
The Israeli civil administration does not
Let an excavator attract so he used
The peak to work a small part
of land but they would not let a
excavator could do more
In the midst of this recording soldiers
Israelis approach the village usually
Impose Check Points of entry and exit
But residents denounce that this
It is about intimidation
that worries the island especially for
their children
how hard our life is
We form but Israel must leave us in
Paz is suffocating Andy one we used to
living in caves they oppose that
Let's live on the surface they want
Let's continue underground
Back to the cave was the only option
to see that he suffered five times the
demolition of your home with seven
relatives is limited by energy
of solar and expensive panels
Gas Garafas is a single cave
entry does not have windows this is not
life and can enter snakes and
Scorpions Israeli occupation wants
Let your land with the excuse that
You have no permission to build but to
Despite that I will stay in the cave for
the rest of my life
As Shout Layline and see about 1300
Palestinians will continue to resist mass
Fair is facing what could be the
Greater Palestinian expulsion since 1967
