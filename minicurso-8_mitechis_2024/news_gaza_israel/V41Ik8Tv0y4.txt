I think that if the
Fire sector because it suits them so much
Israel as Hamas not to follow
making the situation of the conflict more
critic of what is right now there is
to remember that we left
Gaza in 2007 and since we left each
2 to 4 years there is a conflict and a
conflict that we do not start is
a conflict that people living in
Southern Israel are at home seeing
TV quietly and have 15
seconds to get into a shelter if
They cannot die and that is a
situation that is intolerable but to the
the same time the government of Israel has
a lot of responsibility does not like the
Risk does not want to put the lives
of the soldiers the lives of the
Civil population in danger and always
We are adults in this
conflict we always try to go down
The intensity of the conflict and no and is not
Lack how the Gaza are doing
There is responsibility side and side but
In this case the international community
has criticized Israel for unleashing this
climb of violence by that supposed
secret military incursion that were
making members of the army of
Israel in Gaza who was doing the
Israel Army infiltrated at home
Because provoking these escalations of
violence I understand that the army of
Israel always does operations inside
intelligence gauze and why
We do operations within gas from
Intelligence and we do not attract aerial mind
as we could do because always
We are and we keep in mind that people
The civilian population of Gaza does not have
that being the ones who are injured who
They leave dead and why we have to
handle a very delicate situation yes
Of course we have operations of
Intelligence is precisely
to be able to limit deaths and
wounds doing operations
Intelligence to avoid that
Make tunnels under our land
that they have rockets that is
precisely what we do operations
to avoid making the conflict as
We have it right now
