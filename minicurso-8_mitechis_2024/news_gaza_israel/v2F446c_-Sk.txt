And Arabs about the attack on Gaza's Jabaliya
Koram has been created in the countries of Iran
From Jordan and Saudi to Egypt
The country is very angry after this attack
Three pictures show you on Jabaliya
Israel's deadly attack after the attack
It has not been done last night
At this time you are able to see at midnight
Israel's hideouts in Gaza
There was a deadly attack in Jordan at midnight
On the streets against the attack on Jabaliya
People came down against the attack all night
Expresses anger and third picture
I clear the destruction in Jabaliya
You can see the place where Israel's attack
There was a pit around several feet deep there
Only debris is visible here
And to Israel after the attack on Jabaliya
The map of that place has been released from there
But he carried out the attack at this time
This map will show you the same map very important
It is to keep this red circle in front of you
Area is where the landmine of Hamas is on
This time we are telling you water
Pumping station of this and school children
In the war we have seen that human angle
Is not left that is left of children
It is also exhausted and I am here
Let me tell you what is something
Mosque is also a mosque at the second location
Medical clinic actually this medical clinic
It was also said about that
Places have been used by Hamas
Terrorists have intelligence center, this is Hamas
Landon tunnel is Hamas's landmine
Along with telling about you
Rocket launch post is here
That is, where is the army of Israel
We are targeting this map
Trying to show you through
Because repeated allegations of Israeli army
It seems that he is not the terrorists of Hamas
Rather kills common citizens of Gaza
So through this you will know about this map
Through where is the rocket date
Launch post is this battalion command center
Is here and is a lot of Israel's army
It is well known that all these locations
What is it, so if it is being accused
If he kills ordinary citizens, it
Whose is wrong, whose strategy is in this
To tell this full map of Hamas terrorists
The purpose of showing it was our war that you war
You can understand the attitude of this whole map
Can understand where there is something and its
Through it, it is known that the situation is still
What
