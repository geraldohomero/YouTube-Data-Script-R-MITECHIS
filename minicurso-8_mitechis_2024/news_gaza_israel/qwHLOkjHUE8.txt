thousands of tunnels have been dug under
the gaza strip into egypt and israel as
a way to try and beat the israeli
government blockade
some of them are still open and are
surprisingly large an illegal commercial
footpath
as you know all of the crossings are
closed and this is our crossing the
egyptian side always pumps water trying
to destroy them but we have alternative
plans he says he hides his identity
because hamas authorities imposes taxes
on the illicit trade and tries to
control how many tunnels operate the
tunneling and smuggling to and from
egypt is profitable and dangerous
this tunnel entrance is just 20 meters
away from the border it was discovered
four years ago and since then the
egyptians have either put explosives or
pumped water into more than a thousand
of tunnels similar to this one it's
estimated there's only about 20 still
operational in this area

egyptian soldiers are bulldozing their
side of the border digging ditches to
try and deter new tunnels
the soldiers were unhappy we were
filming so close to the border it's
impossible to record by the sensitive
israeli gaza border for security reasons
the israeli military estimates hamas has
spent 30 to 90 million dollars on
tunnels about three million dollars each
to transport heavy machinery and weapons
into the gaza strip
in rafa mohammed tries to pick up fares
in his motorbike taxi he used to earn
200 a week smuggling goods and tobacco
but four years ago he lost his work when
more of the tunnels were discovered and
shut down
the economic situation was perfect then
i was earning at least 700 shekels a
week
sometimes i was able to earn up to a
thousand shekels almost three hundred
dollars
and i was bringing goods in and selling
them here to make a decent living
now in a whole month i can't earn as
much and we have nothing
egypt's army is controlling the southern
gaza border now as carefully as the
israelis are to the north and east
the economic blockade is in its eleventh
year and with fewer tunnels there'll be
fewer goods coming in
yolo after avid trt world rafa on the
egyptian border
