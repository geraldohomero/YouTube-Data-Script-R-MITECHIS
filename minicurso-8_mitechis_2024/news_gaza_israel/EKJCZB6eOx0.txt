Mr President
Joe I want to thank you for coming here
today and for the unequivocal support
you have given Israel during these
trying
times a support that reflects the
overwhelming will of the American
people I've seen your support every day
in the depth and breadth of cooperation
that we have had since the beginning of
this war a level of cooperation that is
truly unprecedented in the history of
the great alliance between our two
Nations we see that support and your
steadfast commitment to to provide
Israel with the tools we need to defend
ourselves we see that support in the
clear message you've sent our enemies
not to test our resolve and in the two
American carrier battle groups that you
sent to the region to back up those
words with action but above all Mr
President the world sees that support
and the moral Clarity that you have
demonstrated from the moment Israel was
attacked

terrorist group Hamas has slaughtered
has been pointed out over 1,300 people
and is not hyperbole Su just slaughtered
slaughtered and uh including 31
Americans as part of
that and uh they've taken scores of
people hostage including
children you said imagine what those
children hiding from Hamas were thinking
it's beyond my comprehension to be able
to imagine what they're
thinking beyond my
comprehension they're committed evils
that U and atrocities that U make Isis
look uh somewhat more

I was deeply saddened and outraged by
the uh explo expon at the hospital in
Gaza yesterday and based on what I've
seen it appears as though it was done by
the other team not not you but there's a
lot of people out there not sure so we
got a lot we got to overcome a lot of
