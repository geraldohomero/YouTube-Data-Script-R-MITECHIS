 
MARCIANO WAS KILLED IN AN 
ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE FIVE DAYS 
AGO. 
>> BRINGING IN BG AND FALLING 
OFF THROUGH JERUSALEM AND IT'S 
GOOD TO SEE YOU. 
EARLIER THIS MORNING I HAD 
HEARD THAT COMMUNICATIONS WITH 
THE AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL OR DOWN. 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE AN IDEA 
OF WHAT THE SITUATION IS LIKE 
NOW AND WE PLAYED THAT IS 
REALLY VIDEO SHOWING WHAT THEY 
SAY ARE HAMAS STRONGHOLDS 
UNDERNEATH CHILDREN'S 
HOSPITALS. 
I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE CLAIMS 
THAT HAMAS IS USING THIS 
HOSPITAL AS A SHIELD. 
>> AND BURY IT DIFFICULT TO GET 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE DAR AL 
SHIFA HOSPITAL, THE BIGGEST 
HOSPITAL. 
THE LATEST OF HER TODAY IS A 
GRIM PICTURE. 
THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR SAYING 
MORE THAN 170 BODIES HAVE BEEN 
BURIED IN WHAT IS A MASS GRAVE. 
PREVIOUSLY THEY DID NOT HAVE TO 
DO THAT. 
THEY WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO 
PERFORM THE BURIAL BECAUSE THEY 
THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE CAUGHT IN 
THE CROSSFIRE AND ALSO THE 
PLIGHT OF MORE THAN 30 BABIES 
AND WE ARE TOLD NEWBORN BABIES 
NEED INTENSIVE CARE. 
THERE IS NO DEVELOPMENT ON 
WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN MOVED 
AND REALLY DIFFICULT. 
AS FOR THE CLAIM THE ISRAELIS 
SAY THERE IS A BUNKER 
UNDERNEATH THE HOSPITAL THAT 
HAMAS HAS BEEN USING. 
THEY HAVE NOT PUT FORTH ANY 
EVIDENCE YET BUT THEY HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT ANOTHERHOSPITAL 
WHERE THEY SAY HAMAS BUILT A ÃºB 
>> HAMAS HAS SAID IT'S WILLING 
TO EXCHANGE 50 TO 70 WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN BEING HELD HOSTAGE IN 
EXCHANGE FOR A FIVE-DAY CEASE-
FIRE. 
I DON'T BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAID 
HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN A CEASE-
FIRE. 
A FIVE-DAY CEASE-FIRE IT SEEMS 
LIKE A LONG TIME. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 
SITUATION IN TERMS OF GETTING 
THESE HOSTAGES RELEASED?
>> I THINK IT IS WORTH 
STRESSING, ANNE-MARIE, IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO HAVE ANY SORT OF 
CERTAINTY WHEN IT COMES TO 
HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS. 
>> Reporter: WE KNOW THE GULF 
STATE OF QATAR IS INTEGRALLY 
INVOLVED AND THERE IS A 
SUGGESTION FROM HAMAS THAT 50 
TO 70 HOSTAGES COULD BE 
RELEASED.
CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE 
SOMETHING THAT FAMILIES HERE IN 
ISRAEL ARE DESPERTELY LOOKING 
FORWARD TO PER THE TERMS OF 
THIS COMING TO FRUITION, WE ARE 
NOT SEEING ANYTHING IMMINENT 
AND THERE IS A BIG STUMBLING 
BLOCK AS YOU SAY, PROTESTANT 
MATT GAHM TO SAYS THE HOSTAGES 
HAS TO BE RELEASED EXPECT ANY
