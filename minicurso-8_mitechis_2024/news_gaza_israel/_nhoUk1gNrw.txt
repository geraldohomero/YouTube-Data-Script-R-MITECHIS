the violence in east jerusalem
has now spread to gaza where hundreds
have been
killed and the violence in gaza can be
traced back to the unrest
in this palestinian neighborhood in east
jerusalem a neighborhood called
sheikh jarrah it is located near
damascus gate
one of the main gates in the world city
now this is what the neighborhood looks
like
right now israeli police have erected
concrete
barriers blocking the entrance to sheikh
jarrah
this comes hours after israeli cops shot
dead a palestinian driver
who crashed into a police roadblock six
officers were injured
in the crash triggering a fresh row in
the area
sheikh jarrah has been at the center of
a long running
legal field the neighborhood is
populated by palestinians but
a legal challenge in the israeli supreme
court
is seeking to evict these palestinians
and bring in israeli settlers to the
area
some israelis had in fact moved in even
before the court verdict
several palestinian groups started
protesting against the case
they argued that evictions in sheikh
jarrah would have a domino effect
now the original verdict was scheduled
for the 10th of may but
it has been deferred to avoid a flash
point a new court session will be
scheduled
within 30 days
now israelis argue that sheikh jarrah
belonged to jews in east jerusalem
before the 1948 war
a lower court has already ruled in favor
of the evictions now there is a
religious
angle to this case as well sheikh jarrah
is home to the tomb
of an ancient jewish high priest
simon the just ahead of the scheduled
verdict u.s
national security adviser jake sullivan
reached out to israel he expressed
concern about the
potential eviction of palestinians in
sheikhjara
the sentiment was echoed by u.n
secretary general
antonio guterres the situation in the
world city has been 10
since ramadan from mid-april
palestinians had been clashing
every night with israeli cops they were
prevented from gathering at the world
city after iftar
which is the daytime fast palestinians
perceived this as a
restriction on their freedom to ascend
israel argues that the cops were there
to maintain order
