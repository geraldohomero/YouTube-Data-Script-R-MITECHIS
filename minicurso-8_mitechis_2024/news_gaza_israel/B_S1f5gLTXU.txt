ISRAEL IS IN THAT THE MOMENT.
SO, IT'S A STATE IN A
TREMENDOUS STATE OF DEVASTATION,
AND, AT THE SAME TIME, ONE THAT
IS DETERMINED TO MOVE FORWARD
AND REBUILD AFTER THIS HORRIFIC,
HORRIFIC TRAUMA.
>> I WANT TO PICK UP OF THAT IN
THE MOMENT, BUT I ALSO WANT TO
READ A POST YOU PUT OUT.
REGARDING THE DEATH TOLL BEING
SO HIGH, AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY
HAPPENING WHEN IT COMES TO
PEOPLE WHO ARE MOURNING.
THOSE ARE THE POEMS THAT HAVE
BEEN LOST.
CEMETERIES HAVE TO POST
ELECTRONIC SIGNS TO DIRECT
MOURNERS TO THE RIGHT FUNERAL.
YOU ATTENDED A FUNERAL, I KNOW,
AVI, THIS, WEEK FOR A 23 YEAR
OLD SOLDIER.
TALK TO ME MORE ABOUT THAT.
>> SO, THE SOLDIER IN QUESTION
WAS ACTUALLY THE COUSIN OF A
FRIEND OF MINE.
HE WAS AN IMMIGRANT FROM
FRANCE.
HE WAS AT KIBBUTZ BE'ERI, ONE
OF THE COMMUNITIES IN ISRAEL,
SOUTH PARK BY THESE
TERRITORIES.
HE HELD FIRE FOR EIGHT HOURS.
HE WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THIS
POSITION FOR EIGHT HOURS.
HE SAVED AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF
LIVES.
HE TOOK A HOW MANY LIVES WE HE
SAVED, BUT IT IS QUITE A LOT,
BEFORE HE WAS UNFORTUNATELY
KILLED IN BATTLE.
THE FUNERAL, WHICH TOOK PLACE
AT MOUNT HURTFUL MILITARY
CEMETERY, THE MAIN MILITARY
CEMETERY IN JERUSALEM, WAS
ATTENDED BY HUNDREDS, PERHAPS
THOUSANDS, OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T
KNOW HIM.
I WAS ONE OF HIM.
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS YOUNG MAN,
BUT WHO WANTED TO COME AND PAY
TRIBUTE TO HIS SACRIFICE.
AND I CAN TELL YOU IN THE SAME
SECTION OF THE CEMETERY IN
WHICH HE WAS LAID TO REST,
THERE WERE THREE OTHER FRESH
GRAVES OF OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE
WHO WERE KILLED IN LAST WEEK'S
HORRIFIC ATTACK.
THIS IS, AGAIN, A COUNTRY THAT
HAS BEEN DEVASTATED, 1300
PEOPLE, THAT IS AN UNFATHOMABLE
NUMBER FOR OUR COUNTRY OF ONLY
10 MILLION PEOPLE.
AND THOUSANDS MISSING,
