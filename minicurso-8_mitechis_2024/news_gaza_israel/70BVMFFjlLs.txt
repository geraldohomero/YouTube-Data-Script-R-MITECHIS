I looked had to spend a month and a half of
fear voltage for a
truce between Israel and Hamas after
thousands of dead and injured in both
Parts gave themselves a cessation agreement to
Fire will also be an exchange of
Hostages where it should be noted that
Two Mexicans tell the information
With Carmen
Whale 45 days of tactics and strategy
Weapons bombs defensive offensive fighting
destruction
Suddenly a pause in the war arose
Israel and the terrorist group ever
reached a first partial agreement
For the release of Reenes and Unal
4 temporary game
days this means the return to the house of
50 of more than 200 hostages they have in
His power never kidnapped
During the ATE of October 7 in
Israel among which are
civilians and foreigners like the two
Mexican compatriots Iliana Gritzewsky
and Oón Hernández who seek peace in a
Electronic concert the condition never
will give only women and children to
Change of 150 Palestinian prisoners
arrested in Israel a pact that also
will allow entry to the Gaza Strip
of 300 trucks with humanitarian aid
per day food medicines and
fuel to save lives in the middle
of this nightmare also
additional that Jams releases them
I linked taller to the fire but this did not
It is the end of the war is just a
I breathe from the days in which they will be done
The exchange although I still don't know
defines the date Israel made it very clear
that after the truce the war
will continue to recover all
hostages
íes esu diplomics with mediation of
Other nations such as Qatar Egypt Türkiye
and the United States to help in
families negotiations
Citizens movements throughout the
planet an amalgam of efforts
military and human politicians that suppose
A step forward a key point to see
Not so far the so longed for the end of the
War with information from Carmen Ballina
