>>> STOPPING TRAFFIC TO SPREAD
THEIR MESSAGE. PRO PALESTINIAN
DEMONSTRATORS, CALLING FOR A
CEASEFIRE IN GAZA MADE FOR A
MESS OF THE MORNING COMMUTE.
THOUSANDS BLOCKING THE
BROOKLYN, MANHATTAN,
WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGES, AND THE
HOLLAND TUNNEL. JESSICA MOORE
SPOKE TO DEMONSTRATORS WHO SAY
THEY ARE WILLING TO GET
ARRESTED TO GET THEIR MESSAGE
OUT.

BRIDGE TO THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE
AND THE HOLLAND TUNNEL.
THOUSANDS OF DEMONSTRATORS
BLOCKED TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF
MANHATTAN STARTING AROUND 9:45
MONDAY MORNING.
>> THIS IS THE BIGGEST PROTEST
WE'VE SEEN IN NEW YORK CITY SO
FAR IN THE LAST COUPLE OF
MONTHS, BLOCKING ALL THE
ENTRANCES. WHAT MESSAGE DOES IT
SEND?
>> AS THE VIOLENCE ESCALATES,
WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR MESSAGE
KNOWN. IT'S NOT COMING FROM THE
TOP, SO THE PEOPLE ARE SENDING
THE MESSAGE.
>> BY BLOCKING THE ENTRANCES
AND EXITS TO LOWER MANHATTAN
TODAY, WE CREATE AN IMPERFECT
ANALOGY FOR WHAT GAZANS ARE
ACKNOWLEDGING.
>> Reporter: SUNDAY MARKS THREE
MONTHS SINCE HAMAS ATTACKED
ISRAEL. ESCALATING TENSIONS
OVERSEAS ARE JUST AS HIGH AT
HOME. HOW IS THIS GOING TO FREE
PALESTINE?

PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
>> Reporter: HUNDREDS OF NYPD
OFFICERS MOBILIZED TO THE
TUNNEL AND BRIDGES, ARRESTING
HUNDREDS OF DEMONSTRATORS. SOME
WHO HAD CHAINED THEMSELVES
TOGETHER FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT.
FREED BY A BUZZ SAW BEFORE
BEING PUT IN HANDCUFFS.
>> THE RIGHT TO PROTEST DOES
NOT GIVE ONE THE RIGHTS TO
BLOCK BRIDGES AND TUNNELS.
>> Reporter: DEMONSTRATORS TELL
CBS2 THEY MAN TO CONTINUE
ESCALATING THEIR DISPLAYS OF
DISAPPROVAL UNTIL A COMPLETE
CEASEFIRE IS ENACTED IN GAZA.
IN LOWER MANHATTAN, JESSICA
MOORE, CBS2 NEWS.
