as the Israeli Hamas War rages on the
word peace may feel like an unreachable
goal even for this time of year but one
man is trying to push back against the
ocean of anger and that is despite the
fact that both his mother and father
were murdered by Hamas terrorists on
October 7th CBS News foreign
correspondent Remy inosencio has this
Ray of Hope from
Jerusalem Israel is
grieving people who lost loved ones like
ma Enon gather with a shared
sorrow what brought you to tears there I
could hear my parents talking to
me
yes what were they saying to
you be strong we are proud of you we
love you en On's parents were killed by
militants on October 7th 76-year-old
bilha and 78-year-old yovi they were in
the prime of their life the couple lived
in southern Israel near the Gaza Strip
security officers said their home was
burned to ashes two bodies found
inside after receiving the news Enon
says he woke up I just told myself MOS
you have a mission to deliver and create
a message of Hope and a better future
how did the murder of your parents turn
you into an activist for peace I
strongly believe that this land was
given and promised to
both Israelis and Palestinian military
Invasion into Gaza will just make things
worse we must break this pattern of
violence of
answering on terrorist attack with with
more violence he blames Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and he is
far from alone his approval plunging
many of his critics say he's using
Israeli deaths to justify even more
deaths in Gaza some people many people
say yes he
should what do you say to that so if we
we are killing a aamas leader he will
have so many replacement but if by
bombing him we are also killing a 10
months or 8 years old Israeli that was
kidnapped by the Kamas and he will also
be killed in this bombing is there a
placement for a 10 months H baby for 8
years old child so who are we punishing
his fear that his parents will not be
the last to die how do you make sure
their death was not in vain I want their
death their
sacrified to be a sacrified for peace
not for war one man with a message of
Hope Holding On For Peace for CBS
