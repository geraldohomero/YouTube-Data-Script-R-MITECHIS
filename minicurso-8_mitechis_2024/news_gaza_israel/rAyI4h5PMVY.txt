We are going to the Middle East now because
After hours of maximum expectation of
A lot of tension finally
extended the truce between Israel and never
For two additional days the government of
Qatar that must be remembered that has been
mediating between the two parties
confirmed the news that allows then
The high on fire and the exchange of more
prisoners and hostages between both sides in the
fourth exchange that was made last night
eh of Reenes finally ever liberated
11 kidnapped Israelies while
Israel only to 33 Palestinians but here a
not less of those 33 Palestinians three
They are women and the other 30 are lower
Good age during the first three
Trugua days had never already
released a total of 58 reins
mainly women and children who have
been the tonic precisely of the
release in return forgiveness of the
Remon liberation in exchange for
release or release of 117
Palestinian prisoners The issue is that
They have been days of cessation of hostilities
what has allowed and that has been a
good news has allowed greater
Humanitarian aid entry and
Basically a respite for the population
Gazatí in fact they said that 56 ago
days could not sleep calmly because
They didn't know if a bomb went to
Awakening and finally in these four
days have been able to
Consider sleep more than 4 hours for
Example yes good news huh
maintained at least the mood of the mood of
give a pause to be able to do these
exchanges eh and hopefully stay and
I hope this is also the point of
Quebre that changes this story that by
moments seemed to never end up clear
Well at least we have two more days
of truce is believed to be released
at least 20 Israeli reenes and 60 prisoners
Palestinians but already the authorities or the
spokesperson both and
Israel government said they are
open to continue talking c of
hostilities while the flow of
Reehen release continues the subject
It is that all the reins are released and there
Benjamín Netan Yjo first or first
Minister of Israel said the war
