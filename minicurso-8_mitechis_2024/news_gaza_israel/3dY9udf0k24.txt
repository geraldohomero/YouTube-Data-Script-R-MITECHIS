PENTAGON, IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT RESPONSE
AGAINST IRAN IS MERITED.
AGAINST IRAN IS MERITED.
>> JONATHAN  A
JOINT STATEMENT FROM THE UNITED
KINGDOM, UNITED STATES, EUROPEAN
UNION MAKING A JOINT STATEMENT
IN SUPPORT OF THE ISRAELI
PEOPLE.
FOR THOSE FIVE COUNTRIES, IT WAS
A PRETTY REMARKABLE STATEMENT OF
SUPPORT AND A STRONG
CONDEMNATION AGAINST THE
TERRORIST ATTACKS.
I THINK WE'RE SEEING SOME UNITY
FROM EUROPE THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS
SEE.
OF COURSE, IN THE FACE OF THESE
HEINOUS TERROR ATTACKS, YOU
WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE TO SEE
THAT.
I'M CURIOUS, THOUGH, HOW MUCH
FORWARD DO WE EXPECT PRESIDENT
BIDEN TO LEAN TODAY?
HOW AGGRESSIVELY TODAY DO WE
EXPECT TO HEAR PRESIDENT BIDE NN
SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE TERROR
ATTACKS AND HIS SUPPORT FOR
ISRAEL?
>> HE WILL BE A FULL-THROATED
DEFENSE FOR ISRAEL AND ITS RIGHT
TO DEFEND ITSELF.
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRIME
MINISTER NETANYAHU, A
COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP.
THE TWO MEN HAVE KNOWN EACH
OTHER A LONG TIME.
THERE'S BEEN UPS AND DOWNS.
THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNED
NETANYAHU'S PUSH TO RESHAPE THE
JUDICIARY THERE IN ISRAEL.
ALL OF THAT WILL BE SET ASIDE
RIGHT NOW.
IN THE SHORT TERM, U.S.
OFFICIALS TELL ME, THE UNITED
STATES UNDERSTANDS, ISRAEL IS
GOING TO RESPOND AND RESPOND
WITH OVERWHELMING FORCE.
WHAT COMES NEXT IS AN OPEN
MATTER.
DEPENDING HOW LONG THIS CONFLICT
LASTS, DEPENDING WHAT ISRAEL'S
FURTHER STEPS WOULD BE, THAT
MIGHT BE WHEN WE HAVE SOME MORE
NUANCE, WHEN THEY HAVE SOME MORE
KOMPL
COMPLICATIONS EMERGE, WHEN THE
U.S. TRY TO GET THEM TO TAP THE
BRAKES.
THAT'S FOR DOWN THE ROAD.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE
MESSAGE FROM TODAY.
IN THE PRESIDENT'S PHONE CALL
WITH PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU
OVER THE WEEKEND, WHEN NETANYAHU
