you're doing his everyday job
going about his farm and cultivating the
land that he owns
he and his ancestors have lived in this
place for generations
but nowadays his family and other jordan
valley residents find it difficult to do
their jobs peacefully due to israelis
annexation plan
[Music]
because of the annexation in israel's
policies i think my children will face
an unknown future
i don't know what's going to happen and
what will be their destiny
i will never leave my village and i
accept annexation even if it costs my
life
here your channel i call all arab and
european countries to stand against this
plan that will destroy all habitants of
this area
the jordan valley is made up of three
areas a b and c
87 of area is controlled by the israeli
military
more than 65 000 palestinians live in
that area and this land constitutes half
of the total agricultural land providing
food to all palestinians in the occupy
west bank
more than 11 000 palestinians live in
this part of the jordan valley the big
question now is what will happen to them
if israel goes through with the
annexation palestinians fear israel
would create unlivable conditions for
them as a way to force them to flee
israeli prime minister netanyahu wants
to make this area of the jordan valley a
part of israel
but it seems the international community
is not convinced
the
international community
i don't think that
will agree about the annexation there is
majority of states
uh overwhelming majority among the
general assembly of the un
that they will reject this plan we hear
from now voices from the eu many voices
against and of course the arab war will
be against the middle east will be
against africa will be against and many
of latin american states will be
farmer against
fuka says the annexation will be another
nakba
where in 1948 700 000 palestinian arabs
fled their homes during the palestine
war
he strongly believes he shouldn't be
uprooted from where his ancestors
originally settled mustafa's tiarte
world jordan valley
