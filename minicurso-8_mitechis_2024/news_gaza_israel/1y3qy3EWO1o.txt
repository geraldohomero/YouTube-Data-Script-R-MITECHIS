turning a focus now to jerusalem where
brief clashes were reported between
israeli police and palestinians at the
al-aqsa mosque on sunday
no serious injuries were reported but
the controversy erupted over israeli
prime minister naftali bennett's comment
on sunday where he said that jews have
freedom of worship
on temple mount the prime minister's
office has now issued a statement
clarifying
that the prime minister's comment was a
mistake and that the status quo has not
changed
which dictates that while jews can visit
the site only muslims are allowed to
pray there
temple mount is the third holiest site
in islam and the holy is for jews
because it was a location of biblical
temples
it also has a history of being the site
of israeli-palestine violence
the most recent being an 11-day war
between israel and hamas militants in
the gaza strip
now is a day of mourning and
repentance when jewish people reflect on
the destruction of the first and second
temples in jerusalem
both are key events in jewish history
our correspondent jody cohen has sent us
more details in this next report from
jerusalem take a look
the ninth of the hebrew month of of is
the time when jews across the world
mark the destruction of the first and
second temples in jerusalem
with fasting and prayer today al-aqsa
mosque stands where the jewish temples
once stood
but it remains the holiest place in
judaism
now in the six day war in 1967 jews took
back control of the holy site
that gave authority to the muslim work
to administer it for muslims to continue
to be able to pray there
over the years jews have been able to
visit the site but have not been
permitted to pray there for fear of
upsetting the status quo
now it seems that the police have been
turning a blind eye to silence jewish
prayer on the site
as long as nothing visibly jewish is on
display
with prime minister naftali bennett
saying that both jews and muslims
will continue to have freedom of worship
on the temple mount
however public security minister omar
valev
subsequently suggested that the pm meant
to save freedom of worship for muslims
and freedom of movement for jews this is
