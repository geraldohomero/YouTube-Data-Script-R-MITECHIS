all right now as the hanukkah holiday
comes to an end and students in the
state of israel head back to their
classes
interestingly according to the israeli
government young school-going children
will be required to get an rt-pcr test
for the coronavirus before being allowed
back into their school premises our next
point gets you all the details
for more than a week children and
families in israel have been celebrating
the festival of lights but dimming the
celebrations somewhat has been the
latest variant of covert 19 omicron
now the festivities are coming to a
close and children are preparing to go
back to school on tuesday but the
government has said they will need to
get tested if they are to be allowed
back in
i spoke with some parents to see how
they feel about the new measures for
returning to school
so i think i think it's a good idea that
kids should be tested before they go
back to school after a week off
when we met the families and had parties
uh just to see that everyone is clear
and go and
we won't have the epidemic again if you
don't know where all the kids been all
the the shows and the things and we want
to go security to the to the
kindergarten and not to go
with closure to be at home and things
like that i think it's a brilliant idea
it shouldn't need to be tested before
going back to school just to play it
safe way
i think we all want the corona to end at
one point or another so i think this is
the best way to go
the new cases include a man who came
into contact with an infected person who
had recently traveled from south africa
this is the first known case of omicron
being transmitted within israel
public health care experts have been
saying that omicron appears to be
potentially more transmissible but less
lethal than other variants
however health ministry chief nachman
ash said it remains unclear how the
strain will hold up against vaccines and
coronavirus salman zakar warned that it
would take another week to know the full
impact of omicron
with thousands of israelis now expected
to fly in from hanukkah travels abroad
time will tell how this will impact
omicron in the country going forward
