NEWSOM PLEDGES TO SEND MEDICAL
AID TO ISRAEL AFTER MEETING

HAMAS TERROR ATTACK.
CHRISTINA COLEMAN LIVE IN LOS

>> HI JON, THERE IS A SEVERE
NEED FOR MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO
TREAT THOSE INJURED AND WHO ARE
NOW FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES IN
ISRAEL AND GAZA.
THERE IS LOTS OF EFFORT TO TRY
AND SUPPORT THE INNOCENT VICTIMS
IN THAT REGION.
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM
VISITED ISRAEL YESTERDAY.
YOU CAN SEE THOSE PICTURES THEY
ARE PRETTY MET WITH PATIENTS IN
A MEDICAL CENTER IN TEL AVIV
EVERY MADE THE STOP AHEAD OF HIS
VISIT TO CHINA FOR A TRIP FOCUS
ON CLIMATE ISSUES.
IN A STATEMENT NEWSOM PLEDGES
CALIFORNIA SUPPORT TO HELP
PROVIDE MEDICAL AID TO ISRAEL
AND GAZA BUT HE SAID QUOTE TODAY
I MET WITH A CALIFORNIAN WHO WAS
SHOT DURING EIGHT MISSILE AND
GRENADE ATTACK.
SHE COVERED HERSELF AMONG DEAD
PEOPLE TO SURVIVE.
AFTER HOURS OF ENDLESS TERROR
SHE WAS RESCUED AND TRANSPORTED
TO A HOSPITAL.
WHAT THE ISRAELI PEOPLE HAVE
EXPERIENCE IS NOTHING SHORT OF
BARBARIC TERRORISM.
AND YESTERDAY ISRAEL'S PRESIDENT
SHARED A PHOTO FROM NEWSOM'S
VISIT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
HE WROTE WE WILL NEVER FORGET
OUR FRIENDS WHO STOOD BY ISRAEL
IN THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES.
MEDICAL AID IS BADLY NEEDED IN
THAT REGION.
VARIOUS AGE GROUPS COLLECT
DONATIONS WORLDWIDE TO HELP LISA
SCHILLER A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE
BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU IS
WARNING FOLKS TO BE VERY CAREFUL
OF SOCIAL MEDIA SCAMMERS WHO
WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE'S
WILLINGNESS TO HELP.
SHE SAYS PEOPLE'S HEARTS ARE ON
THE LINE AND SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO
BE VERY CAREFUL BUT SHE
ENCOURAGES THEM TO DO THEIR
RESEARCH ON SOCIAL MEDIA SOURCES
OR CHARITIES BEFORE MAKING A
DONATION.
