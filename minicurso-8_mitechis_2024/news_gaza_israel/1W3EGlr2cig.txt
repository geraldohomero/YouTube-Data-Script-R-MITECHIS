CONCERN ABOUT THE STATE OF ALL
OF THESE HOSTAGES, INCLUDING
THOSE AMERICANS STILL
UNACCOUNTED FOR, DICK?
>> NICOLE SGANGA AT THE WHITE
HOUSE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>> STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AT A
QUEENS HIGH SCHOOL TRYING TO
DIFFUSE A TROUBLING INCIDENT.
HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS RAN
THROUGH THE HALLS TO PROTEST A
TEACHER WHO ATTENDED A
PRO-ISRAEL RALLY. CBS2'S
POLITICAL REPORTER MARCIA
KRAMER HAS THE STORY.
>> Reporter: STUDENTS AT
HILLCREST HIGH SCHOOL STREAMING
OUT OF SCHOOL TODAY, SUPERVISED
BY DOZENS OF POLICE, SCHOOL
SAFETY AGENTS, SCHOOL
OFFICIALS, AND THE CHANCELLOR
DAVID BANKS. IT CAME AFTER 400
STUDENTS SUPPORTING THE
PALESTINIAN CAUSE RALLIED
AGAINST A TEACHER WHO SUPPORTED
THE JEWISH STATE.
>> MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE.
ANTI-SEMITISM, ISLAMOPHOBIA,
AND ALL FORMS OF BIGOTRY ARE
UNACCEPTABLE.
>> Reporter: THE CHANCELLOR MET
WITH STUDENTS AND TEACHERS TO
TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD
HAPPENED. HE SAID THE PROBLEM
WAS MANY YOUNG PEOPLE GET THEIR
INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA
AND THAT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING
WERE PICTURES OF PALESTINIANS
BEING KILLED. HE ALSO SAID IT
WAS IRRESPONSIBLE TO LUMP ALL
OF THE STUDENTS TOGETHER AND
SAY THEY WERE RADICALIZED OR
TERRORISTS OR ANTI-SEMITIC.
>> THIS NOTION THAT THESE KIDS
ANTI-SEMITIC IS THE HEIGHT OF
IRRESPONSIBILITY.
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT OF
THE SENIOR CLASS SAID THAT MANY
OF THE STUDENTS WHO WERE
PROTESTING DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE PROTESTING
ABOUT.
>> THEY LACK MATURITY, AND THEY
WERE MAKING THIS INTO LIKE A
FUN EVENT IN A SENSE. THEY
DIDN'T REALLY THINK OF IT AS A
SERIOUS MOMENT OR A MOMENT TO
ACTUALLY GO OUT AND PROTEST.
THEY REALLY DID IT FOR THEIR
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT, THEIR
PERSONAL PLEASURE. AND THAT'S
WHAT REALLY CAUSED THE PROBLEM.
>> THE MESSAGE THAT WE REALLY
WANTED TO GET OUT THERE WAS
THAT WE WANTED PALESTINE TO BE
FREE. BUT THE MESSAGE GOT LOST
AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE HURT
MENTALLY, LIKE MOHAMMAD SAID,
AND OUR TEACHER IS IN DANGER.
AND I DO THINK THAT SHE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO COME BACK.
>> Reporter: THE CHANCELLOR
SAID HA THE ORGANIZERS OF THE
PROTEST HAD BEEN SUSPENDED BUT
HE REFUSED TO SAY HOW MANY. THE
CHANCELLOR SAID THAT LATER IN
THE WEEK HE'D HAVE A ZOOM
MEETING WITH EVERYONE PRINCIPAL
