over the territory since
1967 more than 3 million Palestinians
here face about 700 different obstacles
to their freedom of movement including
checkpoints roadblocks and Gates there's
no other way to call it but part it's
not only a human rights organization I
mean anyone who looks at the situation
on the ground knows it is
aparte rights organizations say
Palestinians are denied basic civil
rights including that of freedom of
assembly Association and
expression the Oslo Accords signed in
Washington DC in
1993 were supposed to bring about
Palestinian
self-determination the Accords divided
the West Bank into areas a b and c
area C exclusively for Israelis
