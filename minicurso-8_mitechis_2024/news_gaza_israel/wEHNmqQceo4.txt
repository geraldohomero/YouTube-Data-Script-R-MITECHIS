the Israel Palestinian conflict one of
the world's longest running and most
violent conflicts between two
self-determination movements the Jewish
project and the Palestinian
project Jews and Palestinians both lay
claim to the same
territory after the Ottoman Empire was
defeated in World War I Britain gained
control of Palestine which was inhabited
by a Jewish minority and Arab
majority the International Community
tasked Britain with creating a Jewish
homeland which heightened tensions
between the two groups in the 1920s and
40s the number of Jewish immigrants to
Palestine increased sign significantly
as many Jews fled persecution in Europe
and sought a Homeland in the wake of the
Holocaust I called first me in 1947 the
United Nations voted to divide Palestine
into separate Jewish and Arab states
with Jerusalem under International
administration of the United Nations the
Jewish leadership embraced the plan but
the Arab side rejected it and it was
never implemented in 1948 Jewish leaders
proclaimed the founding of Israel the
first Jewish state in in the
world neighboring Arab countries
intervened with military force hundreds
of thousands of Palestinians fled or
were driven from their homes in what
they call alagba or the
catastrophe the entire region was
divided into three parts Israel the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip the Palestinian
population lives in the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank the Palestinian resistance
which came to be led by the Palestinian
Liberation Organization became
synonymous with y air Arafat the
strongest Palestinian leader to
emerge over the last several decades
though Hardline elements including Hamas
the Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah which is
primarily based in Lebanon have
frequently clashed with Israeli forces
in a battle for control over tiny
slivers of
territory it's a battle which ultimately
pits the Arab world and Israel in its
Western allies primarily the United
States Palestinians say they have been
repressed for decades with an appalling
quality of life in their
territories while Israel one of the most
sophisticated military forces on Earth
premises its existence on securing every
inch of its
territory the region has seen a number
of deadly Wars between Israel and its
Arab neighbors the Oslo Accords that the
Invision two separate states 30 years
ago have failed to get
going
