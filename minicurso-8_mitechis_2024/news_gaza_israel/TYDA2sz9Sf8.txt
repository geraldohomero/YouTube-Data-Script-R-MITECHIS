 
 PLAGIARISM BUT ANTI-SEMITISM 
 SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE.
 WRONG OUTCOME, WE WILL SEE 
 WHERE IT GOES.
 BRIAN: WRITER FOR THE BOSTON 
 GLOBE, KARINE H AJAR, CLAUDINE 
 GAY HAS STEPPED ASIDE BUT THE 
 ISSUE GOES FAR DEEPER THAN WHO 
 SITS IN THE PRESIDENT'S CHAIR.
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT 
 HAPPENED AND WHAT NEEDS TO 
 HAPPEN NEXT?
 >> THAT'S TOTALLY RIGHT.
 IT GOES BEYOND THE RESIGNATION.
 CLAUDINE GAY AS A SMALL PART OF
 WHAT HARVARD IS FACING.
 LOOK AT THE YEAR HARVARD HAS 
 HAD ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, 
 LOOKING AT BOTTOM RANKING FOR 
 FREE SPEECH, PROTESTS ON 
 CAMPUS, BOTCHED CONGRESSIONAL 
 HEARING.
 IT HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE YEAR FOR
 HARVARD AND THAT IS MORE THAN 
 CLAUDINE GAY BUT INSTITUTIONS, 
 HARVARD HAS NOT RECEIVED 
 CRITICISM.
 IT WILL TAKE TALK TO BOTTOM 
 INSTITUTIONAL REFORM 
 ENCOURAGING OPEN DISCOURSE, NEW
 IDEAS, WHERE DISCOURSE CAN 
 THRIVE.
 TAYLOR: IS IT POSSIBLE TO 
 REBOUND FROM THIS?
 WE KNOW APPLICATIONS WERE DOWN 
 17%, DONATIONS HAVE.
 EMILY FLOWN OUT THE WINDOW 
 BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE 
 DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW THE 
 UNIVERSITY HANDLED EVERYTHING.
 DO YOU THINK THE OUTSIDERS WILL
 BE ABLE TO GET PAST THIS?
 >> IT WILL TAKE A LOT.
 I GRADUATED IN 2021 AND HAD A 
 GREAT ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE.
 DISCOURSE WAS DIFFICULT, TO 
 HAVE OPEN CONVERSATIONS AND THE
 SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT'S PLAYING 
 OUT NOW BUT I THINK THOSE 
 PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS WHO ARE
 TRULY INQUISITIVE TO THRIVE, IT
 WILL TAKE A LEADER TO SAY, WE 
 ARE THE LEADING INSTITUTION IN 
 HIGHER EDUCATION AND SHOULD BE 
 SETTING THE EXAMPLE.
 HARVARD, A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT 
 TO SEE THAT.
 BUT SO FAR THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN 
 THE RIGHT STEPS.
 THE BOARD THREATENED TO SUE THE
 POST OVER PLAGIARISM.
 IT WILL TAKE MORE HUMILITY THAN
 TH
