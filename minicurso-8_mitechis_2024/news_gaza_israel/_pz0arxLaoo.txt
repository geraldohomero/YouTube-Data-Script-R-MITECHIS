Saudi Arabia's military is on high alert
after deadly clashes with Yemen's Iran
backed Houthi rebels.
Want to bring in our reporter out of
Riyadh, Sam Dagher, joins me on the
program.
Sam, a pleasure to have you.
Walk us through what actually happened
in Saudi Arabia.
Why do we care when we're paying
attention to the Israel-Hamas war?
Absolutely.
Good morning to you and your viewers.
Basically, I mean, before all of this,
there was a tentative truth in place
between Saudi Arabia and the Houthi
rebels who are backed by Iran in
neighboring Yemen.
And Saudi Arabia was actually holding
direct negotiations with the Houthis to
forge a permanent cease fire and end
this war that started eight years ago
when Saudi Arabia went in to restore
the, you know, the internationally
recognized government of Yemen that was
ousted by the Houthis.
And then obviously, everything changed
on October 7th when Hamas attacked
Israel.
You had the Houthi leader a few days
later come out and make a speech in
which he praised Hamas.
Identified himself as part of the
so-called axis of resistance.
That's backed by Iran.
These are different militant groups in
the region that are backed by Iran and
said that he would do everything to help
Hamas.
He said all military options were being
considered, particularly if the U.S.
stepped in and supports Israel.
And then on October 19, the Houthis
fired a barrage of cruise missiles and
drone northward in the direction of
Israel.
And
a lot of these were intercepted by a
U.S.
destroyer in the Red Sea.
And one of these missiles was
intercepted by Saudi defenses.
But the Saudis did not disclose this.
And then we had last week, you know, the
clashes in which two or three soldiers
were killed.
And at the moment, we have the Saudi
defense minister, Khalid bin Salman, in
Washington, a meeting with U.S.
officials.
And obviously, all of this top of the
agenda.
