truck still tried to cross into the Gaza
Strip but now they're stopped and
stripped of almost everything
I brought milk and yogurt products
regarding my gravel cement and iron of
course it didn't enter
this week Israel shut down the Kerem
Shalom border terminal it was goss's
main crossing for trade now only
humanitarian aid medicine and food can
get in
keeping businesses supplied has become
impossible for Gaza and the new
sanctions also reduce the area where
they're allowed to fish fishermen here
say they're restricted to waters that
are barren the Israeli Navy has shot
Gaza fishermen who crossed the line it
has also taken some of their boats women
to read Israel wants to deprive
fishermen of work the Palestinian
economy has to suffer it's a form of
collective punishment imposed by Israel
Palestinian fishermen have paid heavy
prices Israel says it's responding to
the Gaza border protests that started
more than three months ago some
demonstrators have sent flaming kites
and balloons across the border officials
say they've set fire to nearly 30 square
kilometres of farms and forests since
the protests began thousands of
Palestinians have been wounded by
Israeli fire more than 130 gazans have
been killed the protesters demand an end
to the blockade they also want to return
to lands they were forced to flee when
Israel was created in 1948
the dozens or hundreds of Palestinians
in Gaza who protests and expressed their
anger through flying incendiary balloons
or kites cannot be used to justify
imposing sanctions on 2 million people
in January the UN said Gaza is beyond a
humanitarian crisis and on the verge of
a total systems failure
now Gazans are trapped in a strip of
land waiting for fish and answers that
don't come sera Balter TRT world
