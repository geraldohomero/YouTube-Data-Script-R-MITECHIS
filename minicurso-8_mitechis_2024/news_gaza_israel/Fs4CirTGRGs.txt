the United States has reiterated
Military Support to Israel as the latter
continues its operations in won Gaza US
foreign secretary Lloyd Austin is
addressed a joint press conference with
Israel's defense minister yav galand on
Monday the press conference comes on the
heels of Austin's multi-day visit to
West Asia as the blooded battle in Gaza
is well into its third
month America's commitment to Israel is
unwavering and no individual group or
state should test our
resolve so in the Red Sea we're leading
a multinational Maritime task force to
uphold the Bedrock principle of freedom
of
navigation Iran support for hoodie
attacks on Commercial vessels must
stop the defense secretary also
clarified that his visit is not focused
on dictating terms to Israel as the
country has the right to defend itself
however the statement comes as a
contradiction to Washington pushing for
a more scal down operation targeting
Hamas in
Gaza and I'm not here to dictate
timelines or
terms our support uh to Israel's right
to defend itself is Ironclad as you've
heard me say a number of
time Austin also addressed simmering
tensions on the second war front at the
Israel Lebanon border the Pentagon Chief
sent out a Stern message to Lebanese
militant group hasbullah
on Lebanon uh we've been clear that uh
we don't want to see this conflict widen
into a a uh larger war or Regional war
and uh and we call upon uh Hezbollah uh
to make sure that uh they don't do
things that would provoke a wider
conflict meanwhile while families of
hostages released and those still in
hamas's captivity were seen protesting
outside the venue of the meeting the
demonstrators called on the United
States to pressure Israeli authorities
for a fresh deal that would release all
hostages from
captivity them to talk about the deal
deal to H bring back all the hostages H
I don't care if we will need to stop the
war for this or give the Palestinian
prisoners even all of them H the it must
be a deal H to bring them all back
home the families have set up tents
outside Israel's defense Ministry and
