We get quickly in the plane
international and we have to talk about what
What happens these days in the strip
of Gaza because Israel permanently
Attack different locations in the group
Never and even locations and places of
The civilian population of the Palestinians
And now this point has arrived
Siege that is already not really wanting
that the own were attacked
paramedics this is out
totally of international law and and
in terms of human codes if
There is eh there is a protection not for
those who take care of life even in
Good Israel wars evidently
does not think that in fact from the office
United Nations Humanitarian
They reported that the Israeli army
stopped a medical evacuation convoy in
The city of Kan Yunis every day
We talk about Kan Yunis because you are
centralizing military care there
Well precisely there passed a
I convince with help
Health with medical help basically
with assistance and a
paramedic and everyone else were
also forced to get off the vehicle
and to take off his clothes this informed him
officially not this is what
The Israeli army would have made the
incident occurred since the evacuation of
24 Alamal hospital patients according to
The UN said three doctors were
arrested and one was released for a few hours
later also by huh the
Israelis Israel said previously that
take measures to minimize the casualties of
civilians and accuses combatants of ever
to hide among civilians even
Among hospitals now you
They will remember that this same
argument they gave it when they bombarded
Dec schools and hospitals are not
operating underground are
There we want to achieve this
replicated again in this arrest of
of doctors the incident was not a case
Isolated since other convoy you help
Humanites were also attacked
harassed or intimidated and it is something
which occurs permanently there in the
strip of
gauze
