What can I do? I'm freaking out 
and just thinking about my family. 
This is 21-year-old Gaya Kalderon.
She says her family is missing after Hamas  
militants attacked Nir Oz kibbutz on Saturday.
Among the missing are her father and two of her  
siblings, as well as other relatives.
She was in Tel Aviv at the time and  
is now begging for their safe return.
She says her 12-year-old brother was  
spotted in this video circulating on social media 
– showing him being taken by Palestinian gunmen. 
Reuters was not able to independently verify 
the location or the date the video was filmed. 
He's hurting, they're hurting him here, it was 
so hard to watch. I don't even, I never felt  
like this, I don't even have tears anymore in 
my eyes, I can't cry because I cried so much. 
Islamist Hamas gunmen crossed from Gaza on 
Saturday morning and began their rampage through  
towns in the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.
Israeli authorities have said the death toll  
from the weekend has surpassed 1,000.
Gaza's health ministry said Israel's  
retaliatory air strikes had killed at least 
800 people and wounded thousands more. 
But Kalderon says something she 
saw in the clip is giving her hope. 
I recognised the place, it was like 
next to my father's house and he looked,  
he had no blood on him so that's really 
good and it gives me really hope. 
She pleads that her family not be forgotten.
Everyone in this world, if you can just help  
somehow. Think about my little brother, 
little sister, my father who raised me,  
my sister and brother that I tried to protect 
them my whole life and now I can't do it.
