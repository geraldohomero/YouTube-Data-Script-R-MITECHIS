now the international criminal court
announced on friday that it has
jurisdiction over war crimes committed
by israel
in the palestinian areas paving the way
for a criminal investigation in the
region
judges said that the decision was based
on jurisdictional
rules in icc's founding documents and
does not imply any attempt to determine
statehood or legal borders the court's
decision potentially clears the way
for its chief prosecutor fato bansuda
who
opened war crimes probe despite israeli
objections
bansuda has named the israeli defense
forces and armed palestinian groups like
hamas
as possible perpetrators in the
conflicted region
palestinians have welcomed the landmark
decision responding to the ruling
the palestinian foreign ministry said it
was ready to cooperate with the icc's
prosecutor
the investigations palestine who joined
the court in 2015 have long pushed
for the case and asked the court to look
into israeli actions during its 2014 war
against palestinian militants in the
gaza strip
and west bank israel however has
dismissed the ruling as a political
tribunal
the israeli prime minister benjamin
netanyahu has described it as
pure anti-semitism netanyahu said that
the
decision proves once again that the
court is a political body and not
a legal institution
when the icc investigates israel for
fake war crimes
this is pure anti-semitism the court
established
to prevent atrocities like the nazi
holocaust against the jewish people
is now targeting the one state of the
jewish people
first it outrageously claims that when
jews live in our homeland
this is a war crime second it claims
that
when democratic israel defends itself
against terrorists
who murder our children rocket our
cities we're committing another war
crime yet the icc refuses to investigate
brutal dictatorships like iran and syria
who commit horrific atrocities
almost daily as prime minister of israel
i assure you we will fight this
perversion of justice with all
our might leon is now available in your
