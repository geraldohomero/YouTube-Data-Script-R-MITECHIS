 
EXPELLING ME WE WOULD BE IN A 
BETTER PLACE. 
SPECULATIVE I AM NANCY CORDES 
IS IN WASHINGTON. 
WELCOME TO "AMERICA DECIDES.
" 10 ISRAELIS AND TWO THAI 
CITIZENS WERE RELEASED TO 
TODAY. 
NO AMERICANS AGAIN, BRINGING 
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOSTAGES 
RELEASED TO 62 AS A TRUCE 
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES HELD FOR 
A FIFTH STRAIGHT DAY. 
U.S. OFFICIALS SAY CIA DIRECTOR 
BILL BURNS RETURNED TO QATAR FOR
A NEW ROUND OF TALKS AIMED AT 
MORE FREEING OF HOSTAGES. 
CBS NEWS INTELLIGENCE AND 
NATIONAL REPORTER, OLIVIA, 
JOINING ME NOW. 
>> BROADENING THE POOL OF 
HOSTAGES ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE 
IS ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS 
THAT THE U.S. AND BURNS IS 
PUSHING FOR HERE. 
SPECIFICALLY, EXTENDING FUTURE 
AGREEMENTS, THE ABILITY TO THAT 
HIS SOLDIERS. 
IT'S A TOUGH SELL. HAMAS HAS NOT
SHOWN THEY ARE OPEN TO THAT 
ARRANGEMENT, BUT ONE BARGAINING 
CHIP IS ISRAEL MAY BOOST THE 
RATIO OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS 
RELEASING IN ORDER TO SECURE 
MORE HOSTAGES. 
SO FAR IT HAD BEEN 150 FOR THE 
50 HOSTAGES THAT CAME OUT 
TODAY, AND WE COULD SEE THAT 3-
1 RATIO BOOSTED TO RELEASE MORE 
TIGHTLY HELD HOSTAGES. 
>> WHICH IS INTERESTING, THE 
CEASE-FIRE IS SUPPOSED TO LIFT, 
THURSDAY MORNING. 
WHY SEND THE CIA DIRECTOR TO 
RUN POINT ON THIS NEGOTIATION? 
>> GOOD QUESTION. 
BILL BURNS HAS BEEN DISPATCHED 
AS SORT OF A UTILITY NAFF KNIFE
, SO HE DEALT WITH THE TALIBAN 
AS THE U.S. LEFT AFGHANISTAN. 
MORNING VLADIMIR PUTIN AHEAD OF 
THE INVASION OF UKRAINE. 
HE WORKED ON THAWING FROZEN 
RELATIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF 
THAT SPY BALLOON.  
HE HAS A LOT OF GRAVITAS IN THE 
REGION. 
HE NOW HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT AS 
AN INTELLIGENCE CHIEF OF 
WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES WHICH 
IS WHAT SOME OF THESE TOUGH 
DEALS ACQUIRE. THERE IS A LOT OF
RESPECT AND CLOUT IN THE 
RESPECTIVE REGIONS. THERE IS 
HOPE THAT THEY CAN MAKE SOME 
REAL HEADWAY HERE. 
>> AND HE HAS DEEP TIES IN 
ISRAEL AS WELL. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT, HE DEALS WITH 
A DIRECTOR HE KNOWS VERY WELL, 
AS AN ADDED BUSINESS BONUS. 
>> ISRAEL HAS WARNED OF COURSE 
THAT IF THERE IS NO EXTENSION 
OF THIS NOW SIX-THE 
HUMANITARIAN PAUSE THEY ARE 
READY TO
