Waring between Israel and Hamas
It has been more than 20 days.
Seeing that both of them look less
Are not coming, but war would have been more aggressive
It is going where America is of Israel
He is supporting himself in the middle of all this
Entry North Korean ruler Kim Jung Un Un
Is also done and it can be very dangerous
Because we all know that America
How did Kim Jung to them from side to side
It is said that from time to time such things
Do the whole world trouble
Can and if she is namaz in this war
If you are supporting it, it is really a big
Hard for Israel though
Nothing was officially revealed
Rather two weeks ago when this thing arose
Also Kim Jung was said by his side
It was said from Korea that only Afwa
Which is flown by America
But now these things are coming out
In what ways from sources, which
Hamas's warriors reach weapons
They are delivering those Kim Jung and
Not only now but in the coming time
There are some more such weapons
Carrier
The car can be destroyed many such
All weapons which are from North Korea
Humas can be delivered to the news too
It is being found that North Korean ruler Kim
Jung un
Palestinism
If you will see the issue again if Israel
If Israel did not stop
Stopped but Kim Jung along with Hamas
Openly support or support Hamas
This is to deliver weapons to Hamas
A great difficulty can be because
How is Kim Jung her nature Kim Jung
How the atomic bomb continuously from them
Threatening nuclear tests have been threatened
If he has been threatened with constant threats
Coming with Hums coming to Israel
There can be a big challenge in days
Even from the eyes of the weapon, how we today
Weapon consignment increases near fighter
Will leave and it is very much for Israel
It will be difficult because now that missile
The attack is his Ande Dome System and
There are many such weapons in him now
But the tunnel fight in front of him
How was we millions from the tunnel
Removal and kill now if weapon here
It is very difficult to reach this
For Israel throughout the war
