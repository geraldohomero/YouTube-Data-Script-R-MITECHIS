what happened the last Congress in
Manama was a shame for FIFA it was
violations of the statutes of FIFA
therefore we went to the gas and now
there is a case yes which I think next
month
the gas has to make its decision it's
the resolution what happened was under
heavy pressure but if I should not give
up it was a shame for the president of
FIFA to receive a phone call
from the prime minister of the state of
israel
who made even threats to delete the item
of palestine from the agenda but you
know we will not give up we will not
surrender we will continue fighting
in order to achieve our right

Ezra Hill is
behaving like the body of the
neighborhood Ezra in is
violated
the UN Security
Council resolution the Rahil is
violating human rights principles
is violating the statute afife by
organizing
officially in the occupied territories
Ezreal is not qualified at all to
organize a league outside the
internationally recognized borders
organizing this league is a clear
violation of UN
human rights and status of FIFA and also
restricting the movement of the
Palestinian Federation is also same the
rail is behaving like the body of the
neighbourhood it's the time
to raise red card

their enemy
clear enemy is sparked promoting ethics
and values of the game
exposing the Palestinian cause through
sport and through football is their
enemy restricting our movement
preventing us building facilities on the
ground yesterday we had even a FIFA
resolution to organize a champion one
champion between the champion cancer and
the champion when they worst work in
order to have only one champion they
prevented four or five players from
Hebron to go to Gaza yesterday they
prevented eight players from Rafa to
come and play against the champion of
the West Bank even the issue of having
equipments from outside sometimes the
equipment's coming from FIFA or EFC even
friendly or sometimes official games des
arenes did not give permits to
teams or instructors or
experts to come from outside
but I once again we will continue we
will not give up we will keep fighting
they want us to give up to surrender we
will not
