Russian President Vladimir Putin
Israel Hamas's war on America
Putin had already broken that
Whatever is happening in the middle East
The biggest failure of America's policy
Putin behind the Israel Palestine controversy
Straight directly attributed to America
And now in this episode he has Israeli army
A big about the ground attack on Ki Gaza
Statement of statement
Which makes it feel that perhaps from Putin backdoor
Putin can help Palestine
It is said that bloody game in Gaza stops immediately
Want and from the ground on the Gaza of Israel
Hundreds of people know
Will not accept
We can plan for ground attack in Gaza
Listening about but you and me
Understand that heavy in residential area
The use of weapons is quite complex due to which
All parties have to face serious consequences
Can heavy in those residential areas
Do these operations without equipment and
It is also difficult and the most important thing
This is that citizens' lives in this operation
Will go to Gaza which will be absolutely unacceptable
I live around 2 million people
Apart from this, Putin has Israel and Hamas
Also offered a reconciliation between
Putin says that all of them in this matter
To mediate between the sides
Although he is ready once again
Talk of making Azad Palestine country
Repetition
The main goal is to stop bloodshed
Immediately the ceasefire and the ground situation
Mass efforts to stabilize
I need to insist on this
That Russia with all creative ideology
To coordinate with partners
We believe that Israel is ready
Palestinian conflict only of conversation
It can be solved only through
Targets two states of the United Nations
Formula should be implemented
One with his capital in eastern Jerusalem
Azad Palestinian country's creation
Has been envisaged with Israel
Co -existence in peace and security
Let me tell you that Putin has so far
Carefully violence on both sides
Condemned and America for complete trouble
Held responsible for
On the other hand, Russia's army itself
Ukraine invaded in February 2022
And so far thousands of number in this war
Ukraine citizens killed in
