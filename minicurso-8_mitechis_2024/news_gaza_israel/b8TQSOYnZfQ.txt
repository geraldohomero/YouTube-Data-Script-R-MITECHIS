they call their group Jewish voice for
peace and when President Joe Biden came
to New York for a campaign fundraiser
members took to the streets to protest
against Israel's war on Gaza and the use
of us tax dollars to fund it dozens were
taken away in handcuffs as a Jewish
person I want it perfectly clear to
people that not all Jews support this

Palestinians and the financial support
that has allowed it to continue Kristen
