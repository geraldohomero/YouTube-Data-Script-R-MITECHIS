IMPACT AND THE FEAR THAT MANY
PEOPLE HAVE AS A RESULT OF WHAT
HAPPENED.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE WAR
ARE NOT JUST TAKING PLACE ON
COLLEGE CAMPUSES, THEY ARE ALSO
TAKING PLACE ONLINE.
A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN
PLACED ON X, FORMERLY KNOWN AS
TWITTER.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED A
SPIKE IN HATE SPEECH ON THE
PLATFORM.
ELON MUSK EXPRESS HIS THEORY
LAST WEEK.
MUSK AND PRIME MINISTER
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU MET -- JACOB
WARD JOINS ME NOW.
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS TRIP
ULTIMATELY?
WAS THIS ABOUT BUSINESS OR AN
APOLOGY FOR THE MANY CHALLENGES
THAT MUST HAS FACED?
>> IT WAS THE FEELING OF AN
APOLOGY.
MUSK HAS BEEN UNDER FIRE FOR
THE LAST WEEK AND HAVE SINCE HE
SEEMED TO ENDORSE ANTI-SEMITIC
CONSPIRACY THEORIES ON HIS OWN
PLATFORM AND THAT LED TO THE
OUTRAGE AND WITHDRAWAL OF
ADVERTISING REVENUES THAT
FOLLOWED. YOU ARE LOOKING AT HE
IS LOSING TENS OF BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS AND CHARGES THAT HE HAD
ENGAGED WITH ANTI-SEMITIC
CONTENT AND EMOTING HATE SPEECH
ALONG WITH A LONG PATTERN OF
THAT KIND OF CONTENT FROM HIM
IN THE PAST, THIS LED HIM TO
MAKE THE TRIP. IT SEEMS LIKE HE
GOT WHAT HE WANTED OUT OF IT
POSTING AFTERWARDS ACTIONS
SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.
IT SEEMS TO BE CLEAR THAT THE
OPTICS IS WHAT HE INTENDED.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE OPTICS FOR
ISRAEL OR NETANYAHU, DO THEY
GAIN ANYTHING?
>> THEY DO HE IS NOT JUST THE
CEO OF TESLA, SPACEX AND
PLATFORM X, HE IS ALSO THE CEO
OF STAR LINK, A HUGE MUNICATION
SATELLITE NETWORK THAT HAS BEEN
A LIFELINE FOR COUNTRIES ALL
OVER THE WORLD AND IT HAS BEEN
A TERRIBLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF
TACTICAL ARMORY.
IN THIS CASE THE COMMUNICATIONS
MINISTER UNDER NETANYAHU POSTED
AFTERWARDS ON X THAT HE HAS
ENTERED AN AGREEMENT WITH MUSK
TO NOT GIVE THE RESIDENTS OF
GAZA ACCESS TO STAR LINK
INTERNET UNLESS THE ISRAELI
AUTHORITIES AUTHORIZED IT AHEAD
OF TIME.
HERE WE HAVE A COMING TOGETHER
OF TWO PEOPLE IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE
A DIPLOMATIC MISSION BUT IT
