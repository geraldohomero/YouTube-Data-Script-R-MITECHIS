 
WHILE A COURT WAYS ITS LEGALITY 
IN THE FIFTH CIRCUIT HAS A 
HEARING NEXT WEEK TO CONSIDER 
IF THE ORDER IS LAWFUL AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL. 
>>> ISRAEL CALLED BACK ITS 
NEGOTIATING TEAM FROM QATAR 
SAYING TALKS OF A CEASE-FIRE 
AND HOSTAGE DEAL ARE AT A DEAD 
END. 
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN 
NETANYAHU BLAINE THOMAS FOR THE 
STALEMATE PLEDGING THAT ISRAEL 
NOT SURRENDER TO WHAT IS CALLED 
A DELUSIONAL DEMAND AND VOWED 
TO PRESS ON WITH THE WAR. 
THIS COMES AS DEFENSE SECRETARY 
LLOYD AUSTIN MET WITH HIS 
ISRAELI COVER ABOUT YESTERDAY. 
AUSTIN SAID, MS. RAIL HAS A 
MORAL IMPERATIVE TO PROTECT 
PALESTINIANS AND URGES ISRAEL 
TO ENSURE ANY MILITARY 
OPERATION IN THE SOUTHERN CITY 
OF GAKPO. 
>> THE AMOUNT OF CASUALTIES ARE 
FAR TOO HIGH. 
GAZA IS SUFFERING A 
HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE. 
>> CHRIS LIVESAY IS FOLLOWING 
THE LATEST FROM TEL AVIV. 
CHRIS, GOOD MORNING. 
>> Reporter: HEY, CHANEL. 
IT WAS AN AWKWARD MEETING 
BETWEEN AUSTIN AND HIS ISRAELI 
COUNTERPART. 
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO THERE WAS 
A DELEGATION FROM ISRAEL SENT 
TO WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS 
ALTERNATIVES TO A GROUND 
INVASION OF RAFAH. 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU JUST PULLED 
THAT DELEGATION OVER THIS 
GROWING DIVISION BETWEEN ISRAEL 
AND THE U.S. NEVERTHELESS, THE 
ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER MET 
WITH AUSTIN AND AUSTIN HAD 
THOSE STRONG WORDS TO SAY 
AGAINST THE DEATH TOLL AND 
AGAINST THE SHORTAGE OF FOOD. 
YOU NOTICE, HE WASN'T SPECIFIC 
IN ASSIGNING BLAME. 
ISRAEL IS ARGUING IT'S NOT 
THEIR FAULT. 
IT IS HAMAS HIDING BEHIND 
CIVILIANS AND TAKING THEIR 
FOOD. 
ISRAEL NEVER MISSES AN 
OPPORTUNITY THAT THERE IS NEVER 
BEEN AN ARMY IN THE HISTORY OF 
WARFARE THAT HAS DONE THIS MUCH 
IS ISRAEL TO LIMIT THE LOSS OF 
CIVILIAN LIFE ON THE OTHER 
SIDE. 
ISRAEL FOR INSTANCE, ROUTINELY 
WARNS CIVILIANS THROUGHOUT THE 
STRAIGHT BEFORE THEY LAUNCH A 
STRIKE WHICH PUTS THEM AT A 
SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC 
DISADVANTAGE. 
ISRAEL ARGUES THIS IS ONE OF 
THE REASONS WHY THE WAR IS 
TAKING SO LONG AND ANOTHER 
REASON THE FIGHTING CONTINUES, 
IS BECAUSE CEASE-FIRE TALKS 
CONTINUE TO GO NOWHERE. 
ISRAEL PULLED OUT OF THE LATEST 
TALKS BECAUSE THEY HAD REACHED 
A DEAD END. 
THIS IS AFTER RENEWED OPTIMISM 
BECAUSE ISRAEL AGREED TO AN 
AMERICAN PROPOSAL THAT WOULD'VE 
SEEN HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIAN 
PRISONERS RELEASED FROM ISRAEL 
IN
