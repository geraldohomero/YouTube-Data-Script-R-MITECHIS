Zacarilla walks on which it was going to be
Your house a structure of two homes
for your family freshly destroyed by
Israeli excavators
We wanted to build our life here
take another step but the municipality does not
approved it and asked for permits from
construction but rejected us
All possible forms
Israeli authorities justify
demolitions due to lack of permits but
They are almost never granted to Palestinians
of Jerusalem that are forced to
Build without papers
also if they receive an order from
demolition and do not destroy their
structures the government charges them
Zacarilla work and their uncle began to
demolish and still the municipality
sent two machinery generating them a
debt of 30 thousand dollars
With my own hands we send photos to
the municipality and they said nothing of
that would come again because they did not like
Although demolitions are practices
regular have increased under the new
Israeli government of the extreme right in
Only three months have occurred
half of 2022's demolition according to
Indicates the UN Office for Affairs
humanitarian
Demolitions result in families
losing its place of residence
access to their livelihoods and
Basic services almost 150 Palestinians of
Jerusalem have been displaced more
half are children
With that fear the inhabitants of
YAVEL MUKABER where the authorities
threaten to destroy 132 homes is
The imminent case of Ferras and his family
that for five years they built a home
in his grandfather's lands
In all this residential area that is
Under this street they have received notices
of demolition
The possibility of seeing your house fall
home of your dreams of your family in the
that you lived for years is a
very painful feeling not to see your
possessions between the ruins the family
evicted the house as many denounce
that this policy seeks to throw them out of the
city not to allow constructions in
An act to reduce Arabic presence
In Jerusalem they want to boost the
expansion of Jewish existence and
Israeli to achieve the objectives of
Jewish extremists
Without another place to go Ferras think
Resist both he and his neighbors
They hope to prevent the lights of this
hill are turned off
