>>> ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER IS 
BLAMING HAMAS OVER THE LATEST 
ROUND OF A CEASE-FIRE HAWKS. 
NEGOTIATORS LEFT THE TABLE 
AFTER THE TALKS HIT A DEAD-END. 
THEY SAY HIS COUNTRY WILL NOT 
SURRENDER TO THE, QUOTE, 
DELUSIONAL DEMANDS. 
CHRIS IS IN TEL AVIV. OF 
NEGOTIATIONS TO FALL THROUGH? 
>> Reporter: HEY, WHAT WE DO 
KNOW IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
RENEWED OPTIMISM SURROUNDING 
THE CEASE-FIRE TALKS. 
ISRAEL SAID IT WAS OPEN TO A 
U.S. PROPOSAL THAT WOULD'VE 
SEEN 40 HOSTAGES, ISRAELI 
HOSTAGES THAT HAVE BEEN IN 
CAPTIVITY FOR MORE THAN FIVE 
MONTHS NOW RELEASED AND A SIX-
WEEK PAUSE IN FIGHTING. 
HOWEVER, HAMAS DID NOT AGREE TO 
THAT. 
BOTH SIDES THEY DO BLAME EACH 
OTHER FOR THIS. 
ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IT DOES 
SEEM TO BE HAMAS IT ALWAYS GOES 
BACK TO A DEMAND THAT ALWAYS 
GOES BACK TO A PERMANENT CEASE-
FIRE OR HAVING IDF, THESE 
DEFENSE FORCES PULLING OUT 
COMPLETELY FROM THE GAZA STRIP. 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY ARE 
ABOUT TO DO. 
>> MEANWHILE, THE U.S. IS 
PUTTING THE MOST PRESSURE ON 
THEM TO DATE, WHAT IS THE 
CURRENT STATUS OF HIS PLANS FOR 
EXPANDED OPERATIONS IN RAFAH.  
>> Reporter: THE REPORTED 
30,000+ PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED, 
THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF FOOD, ET 
CETERA. 
ISRAEL DOESN'T DENY THIS, IT 
SIMPLY SAYS THAT THIS IS NOT 
OUR FAULT. 
MEANWHILE, THIS IS A THREAT 
THAT CONTINUES TO NOT JUST 
THREATEN THE LIVES OF THE 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, BUT US AS 
WELL. 
THE UNITED STATES FOR INSTANCE 
WANTS TO HAVE A TWO STATE 
SOLUTION. 
ISRAEL SAYS THERE IS NO WAY WE 
CAN HAVE A TWO STATE SOLUTION 
SO LONG AS HAMAS IS STILL IN 
POWER. 
AND RIGHT NOW, RAFAH IS THIS 
FINAL OF  HAMAS BATTALIONS THAT 
IS BACKED UP BY LOTS AND LOTS 
OF TUNNELS, HUNDREDS AND MILES 
OF TUNNELS GOING THROUGHOUT THE 
GAZA STRIP. 
AND AGAIN, FROM ISRAEL'S 
PERSPECTIVE, IT NEEDS TO BE 
ROOTED OUT BECAUSE HAMAS 
CONTINUES TO LAUNCH ROCKETS, 
CONTINUES TO THREATEN OTHER 
OCTOBER 7 LIKE ATTACKS ON 
ISRAELI TERRITORY. 
IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE A 
SOLUTION, THEY HAVE TO GO IN TO 
RAFAH IN ORDER TO REMOVE HAMAS
