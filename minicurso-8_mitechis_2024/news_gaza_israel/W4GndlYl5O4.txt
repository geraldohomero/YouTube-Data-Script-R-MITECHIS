Dararal Shifa or Healing House in
Arab is the largest medical complex of the
Strip and the heart of
Gaza in the last week the army has
publicly warned again and again
that the continued military use of
Shifa hospital by never
endangers your protection status
by virtue of law
International both Israel and States
United have affirmed that the militants
They never used hospitals from
Gaza to hide command posts and
Hostages using underground tunnels
that extend throughout hundreds
of kilometers an affirmation that the
Group has denied
Repeated to Shifa is a hospital
older than the occupation itself and
It houses sick and wounded and doctors
And nurses and also host children
women and older adults displaced
arrival of the occupation tanks
Shifa is not an achievement to Shifa is a
medical and civil building and not a
establishment
military located in the north of the strip
It used to house army barracks
British became a hospital in
1946 and has been a lifeguard for
Gazat√≠ especially during wars
arbe Israelis of
1948
1967 and
1973 as in all hospitals of the
Strip the Israeli siege has made
Doctors work under conditions
Extreme without oxygen water or fuel
This doctor is in what before
It was the intensive care unit of
hospital instead of connecting
patients to the devices to save the
life we had to evacuate the area
completely as you can see the
paramedics were forced to
Evacuate this department to save
The people of Israeli air attacks
Chifa has capacity for 700
people but the medical organization
Without borders states that the number of
admitted patients amounts to thousands and
What hundreds are more waiting to be admitted
With continuous bombardments it is not clear
If the shifa will resist this war
