HAS ALREADY SIGNALED IT WILL DO
SO QUICKLY. TRUMP OR SMITH CAN
STILL APPEAL THAT DECISION TO
>>> TODAY THE U.N. SECURITY
COUNCIL PASSED A RESOLUTION
BACKING MORE AID FOR GAZA AMID
THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR.
>> COMING AFTER INTENSE
WITH MORE ON THIS.
>> Reporter: ALICE AND MAURICE,
THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION
IS WATERING DOWN THE VERSION TO
PREVENT THE U.S. FROM VETOING
IT. DOES NOT CALL FOR A
CEASEFIRE, BUT CREATES A
PATHWAY TO GET DESPERATELY
NEEDED FOOD AND SUPPLIES TO
GAZA. THE RESOLUTION CALLING
FOR MORE AID TO GAZA COMES AS
THE ORGANIZATION FOUND THAT
STARVING THERE. THAT'S ONE
QUARTER OF THE POPULATION.
>> EVERYBODY HERE IS DESPERATE.
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR FOOD.
AND EVEN IN A CONVOY
TRANSPORTING MEDICINES TO
TRUCKS AND RUN UP, AND WE HAVE
TO SAY ON A LOUD SPEAKER THAT
THIS IS NOT FOOD BECAUSE PEOPLE
ARE SO DESPERATE. THEY WOULD
JUMP ON A MOVING TRUCK TRYING
TO GRAB FOOD.
A HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN GAZA.
>> LAST WEEK WAS FUNCTIONAL AND
THIS WEEK HAS ABOUT 80 PATIENTS
WHO APPEAR TO BE WAITING TO
DIE. THEY HAVE NO POWER, NO
WATER, NO FOOD. MOST OF THE
NURSES AND DOCTORS HAVE GONE.
IT'S A HORRIFIC SCENE.
>> THEY ALSO DEMAND THE
IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL
RELEASE OF HOSTAGES HELD BY
HAMAS, BUT IT DOES NOT CALL FOR
A PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING OR A
CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE, EARNING
THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S., WHICH
ABSTAINED, ALLOWING THE VOTE TO
PASS.
>> IT TOOK MANY DAYS AND MANY,
MANY LONG NIGHTS OF NEGOTIATING
THIS COUNCIL PROVIDED A GLIMMER
OF HOPE AMONGST A SEA OF
UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING.
>> Reporter: BUT THERE IS
TRAGIC NEWS ABOUT ONE OF THE
HOSTAGES. KIBBUTZ HAS CONFIRMED
GADI WAS KILLED BY HAMAS GUNMAN
ON OCTOBER 7, AND THAT HIS
REMAINS HAVE BEEN HELD IN GAZA
HIS WIFE, JUDY, BOTH
DUAL-AMERICAN ISRAELI CITIZENS
