collateral damage this is a this is a
direct targeting of journalists who are
covering uh from South Lebanon what what
has had those journalists were wearing
helmets they were wearing waste coats uh

the media to be killed in southern
Lebanon just days into the war Reuters
journalist Isam Abdullah was killed and
others wounded in what reporters Without
Borders said was a targeted strike from
the direction of the Israeli
border a month later journalists were
injured in an attack in the Border
Village of Yun it is getting harder to
do our job and cover the conflict along
the border we can't access many areas
because it is too dangerous we can't
stay in the same position for a long
time even though we're carrying a camera
and wearing the proper gear here to
identify ourselves as members of the
media we drive through empty Villages
empty roads fearing that we could be
targeted by an Israeli drone even though
we have this sticker on our
vehicle journalists in Gaza 2 have been
targeted dozens have been killed during
the more than six weeks of War Lebanon
is not the only place we saw sh
AB American Palestinian was killed
without anybody being held accountable
we had 50 journalists in Gaza and media
workers killed 60 media Outlets that
were destroyed in Gaza no one is holding
Israel accountable and unfortunately uh
the the people that are V victims are
the ones who are supposed to be telling
us what's happening Lebanon says it will
file a complaint with the UN on the
latest killings it won't be the first
