the conflict continues to polarize the
world in many places both anti-Semitism
and islamophobia have surged since the
Hamas attacks in October London has seen
regular marches in support of Israel and
Palestinians the W's b m reports on
efforts to overcome the
Divide Manan nonon is the son of a
vegetable farmer preparing salads for
his children in his kitchen in London
reminds him of home home that was a
wooden house in Israel in a small
Village near the Gaza Strip both his

it feels as if my childhood was murdered

back to the same result which is
destruction and death there's no other
alternative than to remind people that
we have to end this we have to find a
way to share the
space the candles here are lit for all
the victims not just for one
