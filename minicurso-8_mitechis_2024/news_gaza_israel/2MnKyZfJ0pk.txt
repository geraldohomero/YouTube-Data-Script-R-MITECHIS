mayhem at one of islam's most revered
sites
israeli police attack muslim worshipers
at the al-aqsa mosque in occupied east
jerusalem
palestinians throw rocks to defend
themselves
[Applause]
and israeli security forces respond with
stun grenades and tear gas at the
compound which is also one of the
holiest sites in judaism known as temple
mount we were playing in the mosque
suddenly the soldiers
located the mosque without any alert
they started to
shoot the
bombs and
there are many dozens of injures dozens
of
people who were injured from the bone
here and the bullets it's it's amazing
this is the praying place not for a
fight
the latest violence follows a month of
tensions
on monday israel marked jerusalem day
celebrating his capture and occupation
of east jerusalem in 1967.
palestinians regard the day which
usually sees young zionists marched
through muslim areas as a deliberate
provocation
in an effort to avoid trouble
israeli police have banned the hard-line
nationalists from marching to the area
around al-aqsa mosque however some
hardliners are vowed to defy the ban and
story the mosque complex
the unrest was triggered by protests
against the threatened eviction of
palestinians in sheikh gerard
families living the occupied east
jerusalem neighborhood are palestinian
refugees from the 1948 war surrounding
israel's creation
they took up residence there under an
agreement with jordan which control east
jerusalem from 1948 until 1967.
what is happening in sheikh
is the arbitrary displacement of about
500 people israel wants to raise our
neighborhood and put jewish settlers in
our place court cases are ongoing but we
continue to emphasize our right to this
land these have been our home since
1956. we were born here we grew up here
and we will remain in our homes israel's
supreme court was due to hold a hearing
on monday on the appeal of more than 70
people against the eviction order but
the session has been postponed due to
the unrest
israel has defended the actions of its
security forces but international
pressure is growing with the un and eu
and countries like the u.s russia and
turkey expressing concern about the
escalating situation
