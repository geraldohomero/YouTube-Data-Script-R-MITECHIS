on Saturday morning October 7th at 6:30
in the morning the Red Alert went off
and a barage of missiles fell on our
house in kibot
neros my sons 12 and 16 were alone in my
house sleeping they got into the safe
[Music]
room and they're not bargain chips
they're
children children anywhere in the world
are not supposed to be part of this not
in Gaza nor in Israel nor in Ukraine
nowhere in the world anyone who sees
this can imagine his own children in his
house or her
house um
alone in this nightmare even though my
son was trying hard to hold it closed
the door to the safe room was pushed
open last I heard was my youngest saying
don't take me I'm too
[Music]
young it started with a nightmare that I
had uh that was
visualized in animation so to
speak I woke up in the morning I said I
have to get this um bad dream out of my
head well I can't really get it out of
my head because I live it
but at least to get it out to the world
I think of them alone in a pit or a dark
tunnel with no sense of time it was like
it was you know they went through into
my
head um seriously it's like they're
living in my head uh in my
heart I hope that they are together
keeping each other strong and that they
are with other children who were also
kidnapped until I see them again waiting
to hide hug them again and they gave it
a good
ending um which
is they gave me a good ending to um to
hope
for so I'm I'm very grateful for this
work uh since two of the ladies that
were kidnapped from Mikey boots were
released um we uh we got information
that was not confirmed um that they
heard or that they
think that they heard the
voice um and I'm hoping it's true I
believe that the
kidnappers
terrorists know that we um treasure life
and know that they they were taken not
for fun they were taken to to serve an
interest and obviously if they're alive
I think they will serve this interest a
lot better so I'm sort of hoping that
it's
true and that they're keeping them
safe but as far as I'm concerned my
children should be home
now and that's the first mission that
the Israeli government should uh have on
its
shoulders uh how to do it I don't know
it's not for me to say and it's not for
me to give them any advice I'm sure
they're working very hard to do so um
and it's not an easy solution there is
no easy
solution
