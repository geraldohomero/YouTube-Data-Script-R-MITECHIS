Benjamin Netaniaahou summons a new
17th day war council
confrontation against Hamas
Israeli bombings are incessant
On the Gaza Strip they made
dozens of deaths last night
The army also declares that it has led
Limited land incursions in
The clear enclave of the hamel we
find live from TÃ©aviv what
were the objectives of this mission
nocturnal hello yes we know according to the
last army press release that a
Israeli soldier was killed three others
were injured near the
border with Gaza while others
soldiers led a foray into
The interior of the Palestinian territory
So according to the press release it was
For them to locate to find
body and collect information
On the missing Israelis we know that
these localized incursions they have
potentially took place since already
several days since there is a
ten days about the army
Israeli had sent a first
press release saying that it was one of the
practices led by the army then to
be precise they do not go deep
In the Gaza Strip there remains to
proximity to the border of this
totally insurmountable border of
The Gaza Strip and then we also said
In parallel according to our sources on site
and according to official sources and well
The Israeli army has massively
intensified its strikes for more than 24
hours according to the latest press release from
Palestinian Ministry of Health 436 if
Palestinians have died for 24 hours
in Gaza among them 182 children which
bears the total assessment after 5000
people and then there is also a
issue for the Israeli army is
that of international opinion to this
Even moment I am nearby
of a military base in Telavive since
the army has just invited most of the
international media to show us
A 43 -minute film are images
raw of what happened on the 7th
October 2023 C of appalling images
that we can of course not broadcast at the
television but donation but which we can
Talking is interesting to notice
that the army decided to show us these
images more than weeks after the
events to recall in particular
Why is Israel fighting against Hamas
It was said very clearly by
one of the spokespersons that we have
met he said I quote it is
necessary to see these images for
understand what happens in Gaza in this
moment and remember that 1400 people
perished after the attacks in Hamas
in this October 7 thank you
