last moment information
Unfortunately they are bombing in the
Strip we are going to go live in these
moments to update the
Information we are with live images
and live of what is happening
In the Gaza Strip in what
quickly transformed once again
The battle front exactly
We add Manuel Castro for this
Conflict analysis especially the
gauze strip eh we already said that
politically they are very separated from
Government Alfat that is in
Ramala going specifically to
fight the
Israeli army promised siege
Total to the Gaza Strip while the
military obviously
Israelis are also looking for
militiamen there in that area and monitored
also other areas other gaps that
They can be on the border and bombard
On the other hand the governed territory
ever after this incursion that has
been qualified unprecedented by
part
ever and also era obviously
We remember that Hesb that operates in the south
of Lebanon because we know that some
how many US ships are
Going for the area we don't know if you can
have direct participation for
part of the United States but already Jeat
had said another country that gets into and in
This is the generalized outbreak thus
What are we on the third day huh
From the beginning of attacks by
data that are coming to me
clashes are brutal on the one hand
And on the other and I tell you that almost and almost
Without prisoners, eh this brutal is the
thing on the one hand and on the other we are going to
follow everything that goes
happening of course here in the
Channel 26 screen always reviewing
day to day and all the present
