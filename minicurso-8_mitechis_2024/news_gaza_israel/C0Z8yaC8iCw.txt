On one side where the entire middle east fire shells
Sitting on Israel and Iran's quarrels
Can burst anytime because
On the other hand, Iran inside
Is doing this to Israel himself
Not even
And if Israel is successful in this work
Atoms on the middle east if it gets done
There may be a threat of ravages
That is because the United Nations
International Atomic Energy Agency means
IAEA chief Rafale Maryan Gosi
TV interview said that recent days
Iran's nuclear activities stood
Iran is going to do within a few weeks
Atomic bomb can be made because its
Current uranium enrichment level 60 fifty
Has gone beyond and now that nuclear weapon

Has reached close to
Let me tell you that IAEA December 2023
In his report in my report, Iran
Uranium enrichment level 60 percent
The nuclear level bombs have moved forward
It is close to 90 Q and it is like this
In time when inside the middle East
Tension increased between Iran and Israel
IAEA chief Grosi says that
Our reach at Iran's nuclear bases and
Reduction in transparency for IAEA
The problem is that Gosi further in his statement
Said that I repeatedly to my Iranian counterpart
I am telling that this nuclear activity
To do it and in reality we have level
Access and transparency is not available
Having
Iran should be there with nuclear weapons
He has been saying that his nuclear program
IAA is only for the purpose of peace
The head of the head of January 2023 last year
It was said that Iran has proper quantity
I have uranium enrichment so that many
Can create nuclear weapons
With this statement, the US President Joe Bied
There was a lot of concern in the administration
Even the US State Department
The spokesperson said that Iran's atom
Of activity and its supported groups
Activities are stabilizing the area
There are Iran's uranium enricment
Grosi spoke another big thing for him
It is said that uranium is found in Iran
In place of enrichant atomic sites
There is no status which indicates this
Iran secretly other locations
