And another big news from where
Bider once again said a big statement on the gaz
Diya ceasefire has no meaning
The matter which is said by the bide of Hamas
Peace is possible only by the end of the war, if the war stops
Hamas will again attack again mangoes
Citizens can be targeted by Hamas
Different statements from side to side
It is said that it is said that
War in lieu of hostage release
May be the path of a few days in the gazelle
Can be found, but the biddles who are saying this right now
Are there no meaning of ceasefire
Had it been, it seems that Hamas
This war will continue till the destruction
Let's just be pointing out a big statement
Let me tell you a solution for a ceasefire
It is not said that the bide and this
You also change a little change in America's attitude
Will see here because the first four
Five days of ceasefire would be mentioned
If the attack stops, then a big for Hamas
Hamas will get the opportunity to himself
Hamas fighters united
Will be tried to take advantage of it
Will go to this stage of war now
If it is fired, then other than this
What was said, arms amidst war firing
To collect the gathering
Hamas will try again to the common people
If you target will strengthen itself, then
The life of common people is a big threat until
Hamas's ideology is not peace till then
That the same thing has been said here
It is saying that complete destruction of Hamas
It is important that yes Hamas has given school and hospital
Terrorists also did not leave civilian hideouts
Hamas has been converted into a base
Humas did all this responsibility
Which is going to know the common people there
For that too, the bide directly to Hamas
Are seen holding responsible
