you can see a lot more preparations for
war in la vie that weren't evident
two weeks ago i'm walking beside a
beautiful old church in the downtown
old area of the city and i'll just turn
the camera so you can actually see
what's been going on there you can see
some of the statues that this church
have been covered up with fabric
as a protection against
falling bombs i don't think that's going
to do much good actually against
russian bombardment i noticed yesterday
that uh city crews were putting concrete
barriers in front of some key public
buildings
with sandbags piled high in front so it
does show that they're beginning to get
much more worried that the bombing is
going to come in this direction
it's an old european city quite
beautiful
it wasn't bombed in the second world war
so it's pretty much intact it's son it's
unesco protected
a lot of people out this morning
it's a
regular cool
sunday morning it's very much a cafe
society so the cafes are all open and
and full a lot of people from la viv
have left they've gone to poland if they
possibly can
for safety many others many thousands of
others have either come through the city
or have come to the city for refuge from
kharkiv and from key from those
cities that are now being pounded in the
eastern part of the country the worry
here
and that's why you see these
statues being wrapped up in sandbags is
that
eventually the russians are going to
come in this direction they've been very
preoccupied with trying to take over the
eastern part of ukraine
but at some point they may turn their
attention in this direction and that's
because
all of the supplies the munitions the
javelin missiles the anti-tank missiles
that are coming from canada from the
united states from western europe are
all going into poland and then will be
brought in mostly likely by trucks
towards the east and at some point the
russians may decide that they have to
stop and block that supply line in order
to maintain their gains in
eastern ukraine and that's
very much the concern and the worry here
one more
picture of another
statue that's been wrapped up
again the fear is that this city will
eventually come under attack if the
russians turn their attention to the
western part of the country paul work
