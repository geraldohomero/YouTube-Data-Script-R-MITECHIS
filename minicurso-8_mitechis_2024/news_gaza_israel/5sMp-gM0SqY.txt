 
ACCUSED OF --. -- A TEMPORARY 
PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING. 
BUT FOR MORE ON THE HOSTAGE 
RELEASE WE WILL BRING BACK 
ROBERT BERGER. 
WHERE THE HOSTAGES ON THE 
PRISONERS. 
>> NINE HOURS LATER HAMAS 
RELEASED 13 IT IS REALLY 
HOSTAGES FROM A TWO-YEAR-OLD 
GIRL UP TO AND THEN THE RED 
CROSS DROVE THEM ACROSS THE 
BORDER INTO EGYPT A FEW HOURS 
LATER AND THEY WERE HANDED OVER 
TO ISRAEL. 
RIGHT NOW WE ARE BACK AT AN 
ISRAELI MEDICAL BASE. 
SOME WERE TAKEN TO BE REUNITED 
WITH FAMILIES. 
AND OF COURSE, IN EXCHANGE, 
ISRAEL IS NOW RELEASING 39 
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS INCLUDING 
WOMEN AND TEENAGERS. 
>> WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE 
ANOTHER ROUND OF HOSTAGE AND 
PRISONER EXCHANGES BETWEEN 
ISRAEL AND HAMAS? 
I KNOW IT IS JUST THE FIRST DAY 
BUT HAS THERE BEEN A HINT OF A 
TIMETABLE? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
TOMORROW. 
THE DEAL CALLS FOR THE RELEASE 
OF A TOTAL OF 50 IS REALLY 
HOSTAGES IN EXCHANGE FOR 150 
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS. 
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE 
OVER THE NEXT FOUR DAYS DURING 
A CEASE-FIRE. 
IF ALL GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN, 
TOMORROW SHOULD LOOK A LOT LIKE 
TODAY. 
ISRAEL HAS SAID THEY ARE 
WILLING TO EXTEND THE CEASE-
FIRE BY ANOTHER DAY IF HAMAS 
WILL RELEASE ANOTHER 10 
HOSTAGES SO THAT COULD CONTINUE 
FOR A FEW DAYS. 
>> WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 
RELEASE OF THE 10 TAIWANESE 
NATIONALS? 
AND SINCE IT IS 10, DOES THAT 
MEAN ANOTHER DAY? 
>> THE TAIWANESE HOSTAGES ARE 
AN UNDERREPORTED PART OF THE 
STORY. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF TAIWANESE 
AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AND 26 WERE
TAKEN DURING THE OCTOBER 
TERRORIST ATTACK AND 39 WERE 
KILLED. 
IT IS A SIMPLE THE REST OF THE 
HOSTAGES, ABOUT 14 WILL BE 
RELEASED OVER THE COMING DAYS 
IN ADDITION TO THE IS REALLY 
HOSTAGES. 
>> HAVE BOTH SIDES BEEN 
RESPCTING THE TERMS? 
THINGS ARE FRAGILE. 
>> DEFINITELY FRAGILE BUT IT IS 
ALMOST SURPRISING HOW WELL THE 
CEASE-FIRE WENT. 
THE CEASE-FIRE, IT WORKED 
IMMEDIATELY. THAT IS IN 
CONTRAST TO THE 50 DAY GAZA WAR 
IN 2014 WHEN THERE WERE A LOT 
OF CEASE-FIRES THAT FAILED 
BEFORE THE FINAL ONE TO COLD. 
I THINK IT IS A GOOD SIGN FOR 
THE COMING DAYS EVEN THOUGH 
SOME KIND OF VIOLATION COULD 
SCUTTLE THE WHOLE THING BUT IT 
SEEMS LIKE BOTH SIDES ARE 
INTERESTED IN GOING FORWARD. 
ISRAEL IS CALLING THIS A PAUSE. 
THEY SAY AT THE END OF THE 
CEASE-FIRE THEY WILL GO BACK TO 
WAR TO DESTROY HAMA
