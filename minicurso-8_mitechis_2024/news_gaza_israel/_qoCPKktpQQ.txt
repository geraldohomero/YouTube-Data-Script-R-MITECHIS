PEOPLE HOME, KRISTEN.
I WOULD SUPPORT A DEAL THAT IS
FAIR AND EQUITABLE AND ONE THAT
GETS THESE PEOPLE HOME NOW.
>> LET ME ASK YOU, BROADLY
SPEAKING ABOUT HOW ISRAEL IS
CARRYING OUT THE WAR.
THE U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF HAS
SAID THAT ISRAEL IS, QUOTE,
COMMITTING WAR CRIMES IN GAZA.
BASED ON WHAT YOU LEARNEDED ON
YOUR TRIP, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
ISRAEL IS FOLLOWING
INTERNATIONAL LAW?
>> YES, I ABSOLUTELY DO BELIEVE
ISRAEL IS FOLLOWING
INTERNATIONAL LAW, KRISTEN, AND
I WILL TELL YOU UNLIKE A LOT OF
OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPRESSING
OPINIONS ABOUT THIS I WAS THERE?
SPEAK TO THE LEADERS IN ISRAEL
AND SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT OF
ISRAEL AND SPOKE TO THE ISRAELI
DEFENSE FORCES.
I WAS 6 HUN00 YARDS FROM THE GAZ
BORDER.
I WENT EVERYWHERE IN ISRAEL TO
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEY'RE
DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO
AVOID CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT HAMAS IS
FORCING THESE CIVILIANS TO STAY
IN PLACES WHERE ISRAEL'S WARNING
THEM OUT OF, DROPPING THOUSANDS
OF LEAFLETS AND SENDING HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF TEXT MESSAGES TO
WARN PEOPLE AWAY FROM AREAS
BEFORE THEY'RE ATTACKED.
IT IS HAMAS THAT'S DOING THIS
AND LET US NOT FORGET FOR THOSE
ADVOCATING FOR A CEASEFIRE.
THERE WAS A CEASEFIRE ON OCTOBER
6th AND IT WAS HAMAS THAT BROKE
IT ON OCTOBER 7th, AND I WILL
TELL YOU, I SAW THE 43-MINUTE
VIDEO THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER FROM
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT FROM RAW
FOOTAGE, FROM NOT ONLY ISRAELI
SOURCES, BUT FROM BODY CAMS AND
DASH CAMS FROM HAMAS TERRORISTS.
WHAT THEY DID ON OCTOBER 7th WAS
THE GREATEST VIOLATION OF
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE
GREATEST VIOLATION TO HUMANITY
AND THE WORST PART, KRISTEN,
THEY DID IT WITH JOY.
WE HAD ONE YOUNG MAN WHO CALLED
BACK TO HIS FAMILY IN HAMAS IN A
CELL PHONE CALL THAT WAS
