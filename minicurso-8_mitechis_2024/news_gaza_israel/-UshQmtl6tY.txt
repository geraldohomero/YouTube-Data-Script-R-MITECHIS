US.
CONGRATULATIONS, WE'RE HAPPY FOR
YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
YOU TOO.
>> Carley: JOEY OVER TO YOU.
>> Joey: BBC INTERNATIONAL
ADMITS HE MADE MISTAKES ON THE
GAZA HOSPITAL BLAST LAST MONTH.
QUOTE, I DON'T REGRET ONE THING
BECAUSE I THINK I WAS MEASURED
THROUGHOUT.
I DIDN'T RACE TO JUDGMENT.
>> Carley: HIS INITIAL REPORT
SAID HIS EXPLOSION DESTROYED THE
HOSPITAL.
IT WAS ALREADY DAMAGED FROM A
SMALLER ATTACK AT THE WEEKEND.
THE BUILDING WAS FLATTENED.
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND
COLUMNIST FOR THE MESSENGER JOE
CONCHA JOINS US NOW.
HE SAYS THE BUILDING WAS
FLATTENED.
WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I'M SURE MANY DON'T KNOW WHO
THIS BBC EDITOR IS.
IT SHOWS A LARGER TREND OF
REPORTERS SUPPORTING THE
PALESTINIAN SIDE OVER ISRAEL.
AND THEN HIM SO BLATANTLY SAYING
HE DOESN'T REGRET WHAT HE SAID.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ALL OF
THIS?
>> WELL, FIRST, THAT WAS A VERY
MOVING INTERVIEW YOU DID THERE,
CARLEY.
I'M A LITTLE TEARED UP.
SO I WILL TRY TO WORK THROUGH
THIS JUST REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF
MY OWN SON WHO WILL BE TURNING 9
THIS YEAR.
LET'S BE CLEAR WITHOUT ANY
AMBIGUITY GETTING BACK TO THE
TOPIC AT HAND THIS EDITOR JEREMY
BOWEN ONE SHOULD BE FIRED.
REMEMBER OF ALL THE VIOLENT
PROTESTS THAT RESULTED FROM
POLLING BBC CNN, "WASHINGTON
TIMES" "THE WASHINGTON POST."
CARRIED OUT BY ISRAELIS AND
HUNDREDS WERE DEAD AT A
HOSPITAL.
FOR BOWEN TO SAY HE HAS NO
REGRETS, CLEARLY SHOWS THAT HE
IS AGENDA DRIVEN.
SYMPATHETIC TO HAMAS.
HE SHOULD NOT BE IN ANY POSITION
AT INTERNATIONAL NEWS
ORGANIZATION.
FULL STOP.
IT'S THIS SORT OF REPORTING --
ONE THING TO GET SOMETHING WRONG
WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
POLITICS, BUT IN THIS CASE THIS
IS THE KIND OF STUFF GET PEOPLE
KILLED.
FOR HIM TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE.
I'M SORRY.
THIS PERSON SHOULD NOT BE
WORKING ANYWHERE NEAR ANY NEWS
ORGANIZATION, GUYS.
I KNOW WOULD OUT OF TIME THAT
WILL BE THAT.
>> Joey: TOO MUCH TO ASK F
