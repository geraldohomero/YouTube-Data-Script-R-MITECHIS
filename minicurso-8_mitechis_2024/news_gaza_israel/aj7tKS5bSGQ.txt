TRUMP GOT UP AND LEFT BEFORE
COURT WAS DONE FOR THE DAY,
MUTTERING TO HIMSELF,
UNBELIEVABLE. IN LOWER
MANHATTAN, ALICE GAINER, CBS2
NEWS.
>>> NOW TO THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. SMOKE AND
EXPLOSIONS OVER GAZA TODAY AS
ISRAEL SAYS AIR STRIKES HAVE
KILLED HAMAS MILITANTS AND
DESTROYED SOME OF THEIR
TUNNELS.
>> Reporter: BUT THE AIR
ASSAULT HAS CREATED AN
ESCALATING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.
TINA KRAUS REPORTS FROM TEL
AVIV.
>> Reporter: U.S. OFFICIALS
TELL CBS NEWS ISRAEL HAS
DELAYED THE GROUND INVASION
INTO GAZA, POSSIBLY TO ALLOW
MORE TIME FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO
FREE THE HOSTAGES. THE QATAR
FOREIGN MINISTRY IS TAKING LEAD
ON THOSE TALKS. HAMAS CONTINUES
TO HOLD MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE,
KIDNAPPED DURING ITS TERROR
ATTACKS ON SOUTHERN ISRAEL.
>> AND BIDEN REITERATED HIS
SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL, BUT SAID
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS
DESERVE TO LIVE SIDE BY SIDE IN
SAFETY.

COULD NO LONGER TERRORIZE
ISRAEL, AND USE PALESTINIAN
CIVILIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS.

FORCES GATHERED DOZENS OF
FOREIGN JOURNALISTS TO SHOW 46
MINUTES OF GRUESOME VIDEO FROM
THE HAMAS INVASION. THE FOOTAGE
IS TOO GRAPHIC TO SHOW HERE AND
INCLUDING THE MURDER OF ENTIRE
FAMILIES.
>> AND THEY SHOWED US THAT
VIDEO, SO THE WORLD UNDERSTANDS
THE AIR STRIKES ON GAZA AND IT
IS NOT ABOUT REVENGE, BUT ABOUT
MAKING SURE THERE IS NEVER
ANOTHER OCTOBER 7.
>> WE WERE CAUGHT BY SURPRISE
AND AS LONG AS IT WILL TAKE.
>> Reporter: MORE THAN TWO
WEEKS OF RELENTLESS AIR STRIKES
HAVE CREATED AN ESCALATING
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA.
THOUSANDS HAVE DIED INCLUDING
CIVILIANS CAUGHT IN THE
CROSSFIRE. ARE THEY THE ENEMY
ASKED THIS MAN? POINTING TO HIS
WOUNDED SON? AND HAMAS HAS ALSO
CONTINUED ITS ATTACKS. SHOOTING
ANOTHER BARRAGE OF ROCKETS OVER
