I don't know what children think
Palestine they can only sit
pensive seeing the building
the protector is destroyed into debris
After the Israeli military bombarded
Rafah region on
Friday Nadin Abdul, this 13 -year -old girl
become one of the victims
loss of shelter for second
the time when Rah Diah he and
his family lives badly due to
Attack
Is Nadin lives with his family in
Gaza City When Conflict
starting but after his residence
bombed and his brother was killed
His family decided to
leave the area and move
to Rafah in the hope of the region
will be more
safe
People's houses we did not know who they
are so we stayed there and the house
that we stayed and we thought it was
good and we found a finally a
house next to it was
Bombed the house the house jiggled and
The House Went Crazy And The Windows
broke what was i supposed to do my
Brother Was Shaking I Was Shaking I Was
Scared I Didn't Move from My Place of
How terrified I was
For him this Israeli and Hamas conflict
has made trauma shadows
Death also seemed to keep haunting him
where he always watched
the people closest to him were killed by
troops
Israel
many beds and many pillows that you can
See Here and Many Cloes of Children And
women and all of those people were
Killed Here You Can Clearly See That The
Houses are sticked together so when they
target to one house they're targeting a
whole block by this point and it's
unfair why can't we live normally why
Can't we live a normal life i mean we're
Children and We People Children Will
Killed Here Imagine Children Babies
Palestinian health authority says
Around 210 people were killed in 24 hours
Finally due to attack
Israel that number increases the amount
the victim died
21,320 people while thousands
lost
collapse
