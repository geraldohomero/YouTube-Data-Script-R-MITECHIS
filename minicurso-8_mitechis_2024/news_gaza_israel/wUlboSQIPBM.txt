You go live to that border
Between Israel and Gaza is the image that
We are now receiving live
Israel fighting follows has agreed
Remember a 4 -day truce with ever
To exchange hostages for prisoners
But it seems that some problems
administrative some differences in
Last minute negotiation force
postpone that agreement we are going to
border and are used to confirm if
The fighting continues to what time
use good morning
Yes follow those fighting we are
Listening to those artillery attacks
It is true that here are 99:28 of the
Tomorrow would be half an hour for
that high fire will enter into force in
any case as I said is postponed eh
Because Israel has not received that first
List with the number with the name of the
first hostages that were going to be
released the first the office of
Qatar Foreign Prime Minister
He says they continue working so that
Parties fulfill their agreement do so with
Help says from the United States and Egypt
and that the next few hours will announce
When that high on fire enters into force
Here the Berseba hospital south of the
country had already prepared to receive
To those first hostages because there they were
to receive the first eh the first
Medical inspection but as we say
That exit is delayed has been a hard
blow to families grows
anguish criticize the government because
They say they have learned by the media
of communication the army already warned
that EH was not going to announce families
Eh who were the liberated hostages
Until they were on Israeli soil
From the prime minister's office
They say that there is no release from
Hostages continue the fighting continues
War as until now there will be no
High to fire until that does not suck
The Israeli army has passed that part
of war eh that does it every day
He says he has continued to bombard him
throughout the night attacking until
300 Objectives of Never Also
underground infrastructure and as
We say at this time here you can hear the
Artillery attack noise
Alarms have also sounded
Kel√≥n for the launch of rockets
