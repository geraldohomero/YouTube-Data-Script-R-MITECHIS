life under occupation has never been
easy for Palestinians but the recent
move by Israeli politicians to silence
the Muslim call to prayer has made it
even worse
Palestinians say it is only their
religion that's being targeted
subsets me the cost of prayer have been
taking place for over 1,400 years nobody
would deny Jews their own religious
rituals which is their right and this is
our religious right the bill that could
ban the use of loudspeakers at mosques
is said to be aimed at avoiding public
disturbance the noise is terrible I have
a little kid he cannot sleep at noon
because the big noise
critics of the new law say the Israeli
government is trying to eradicate the
region's heritage its history has been
shaped by the three major religions of
Judaism Christianity and Islam
it is very clear the Israeli occupation
with this law or the attempt at this law
wants to judaize the city they don't
want to hear Arabic prayers in the city
they don't want to see churches in the
city
the bill had been put on hold after an
objection by Minister of Health Yakov
Littman who said it could apply to
similarly loud Jewish prayers Littman
lifted his objections after the bill was
amended to apply only between 11:00 p.m.
and 7:00 a.m. restricting only the first
of the five daily muslim calls to prayer
just before dawn it means the jewish
siren that announces the start of
Shabbat at sunset each Friday will not
be affected even some Israeli government
watchdogs have described the move as a
threat to religious freedom and an
unnecessary provocation
after being approved by the Israeli
government the bill is now making its
way to Parliament the Knesset
after being approved by the Israeli
government the bill is now making its
way to Parliament where Arab MPs have
been making their protests heard if
passed the law will apply not only to
Jerusalem but also to other Muslim areas
in the occupied territories and it's
likely to add a new dimension to the
long-standing conflict in Palestine
