EFFECT TODAY CITY WIDE. CHRIS
AND MARY, BACK TO YOU.
>> GUY, THANK YOU. 5:01 RIGHT
NOW. WE BEGIN WITH BREAKING
NEWS. ATTENTION OVER WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN ISRAEL APPEARS TO
BE AT THE HEART OF A HATE CRIME
INVESTIGATION.
>> ELIJAH WESTBROOK IS LIVE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> CHRIS AND MARY, FOR
STARTERS, WE WANT TO MENTION
THE SUSPECTS ARE STILL ON THE
RUN AT THIS HOUR. IT'S UNCLEAR
JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE POLICE ARE
LOOKING FOR. I CAN TELL YOU IT
HAPPENED IN THIS GENERAL AREA
OF 86th STREET HERE IN BAY
RIDGE. AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND
ME, THE SCENE HAS SINCE BEEN
CLEARED. WE WANT TO GO AHEAD
AND SHOW YOU VIDEO WE WERE ABLE
TO GATHER AS OF A FEW HOURS
AGO, SHOWING HOW THIS
INVESTIGATION PLAYED OUT. THE
NYPD IS REPORTING AND HAPPENED
AT AROUND 11:30 LAST NIGHT.
POLICE SAY SUSPECTS RIDING IN
THREE CARS WAVING ISREALI FLAGS
REMARKS AT THREE MEN WHO WERE
JUST WALKING DOWN THE STREET
HERE. WE'RE HEARING ONE OF THEM
YELLED BACK AT THE CARS, FREE
PALESTINE. THAT'S WHEN THE
THREE CARS PULLED OVER AND THE
GROUP GOT OUT AND APPROACHED
THE THREE MEN. THE 18-YEAR-OLD
WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THAT GROUP
WAS PUNCHED AND KICKED
REPEATEDLY WHILE THE OTHER TWO
WERE HARASSED ACCORDING TO
AUTHORITIES. THE GROUP, WE'RE
LEARNING, GOT BACK INTO THEIR
CARS AND DROVE AWAY. NOW THE
VICTIMS ARE 18, 19, AND 21
YEARS OLD. THE 18-YEAR-OLD THAT
WAS ATTACKED REFUSED MEDICAL
ATTENTION. POLICE SAY HE IS
DOING OKAY. NOW WE DO WANT TO
MENTION THAT INVESTIGATORS
BELIEVE THE MEN TARGETED WERE
OF ARAB OR PALESTINIAN DECENT.
AS OF THIS HOUR, AGAIN, IT'S
UNCLEAR JUST HOW MANY SUSPECTS
WERE INVOLVED IN THIS CASE
HERE. ALL WE KNOW AT THIS HOUR
IS THAT THREE CARS HAD
ESSENTIALLY PULLED OVER ON THE
SIDE OF THE ROAD HERE AND
ASSAULTED, ULTIMATELY ATTACKING
THE 18-YEAR-OLD IN THIS CASE.
SO WE WILL BE CLOSELY FOLLOWING
THE SITUATION AND BRING YOU THE
LATEST THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.
