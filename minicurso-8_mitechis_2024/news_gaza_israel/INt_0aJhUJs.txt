For years Israel and Palestine have
Conflict status for the dispute of
Territory however war
Derived from the attacks of October 7
It is not between the two states but between
Israel and the terrorist group ever

Last Saturday, October 7, they began
a series of attacks between Israel and the
Hamas terrorist group as a consequence
of a geopolitical conflict between
Palestine and Israel who has whipped half
East during the government
Palestine demarcates this group and
Israel has clarified that war is
against the same not against Palestine
So where does it come from
Never founded in 1987 during the first
intifada Palestine against the
Israeli occupation as an opposition to
Palestine Liberation Organization
Because they considered that this was not
managing to defend the interests of the
Palestinian people his name is the
acronym for Hararat al Mahama al Islamia
which translated into Spanish means
Islamic resistance movement
Palestine the objective of this group is
establish a Muslim Palestinian regime
In the territories of Sis Jordan Gaza
and Israel denying all legitimacy of
the latter as a state and claiming the
return from Palestinian refugees to
its native peoples which are
find in what is identified today
as

Israel
The modus operandi of this Group advocates
for dialogue and negotiation without
embargo do not rule out accompanying them with the
Use of violence unlike groups
Jihadistas such as Alcaeda or the State
Islamic are distinguished by using the
violence as the main method is
characteristic makes some
states is ambiguous to classify
Never like a terrorist group although not
For the UN the European Union states
United Canada Japan Australia Paraguay or
The Organization of American States
who keep them on their list of
Organizations
