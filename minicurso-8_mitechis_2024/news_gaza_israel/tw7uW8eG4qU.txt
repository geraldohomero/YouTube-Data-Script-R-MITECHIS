PLEADED WITH CANADA TO TAKE
ACTION, UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT
SAYS IT SETS A DANGEROUS
PRECEDENT.
CTV'S OTTAWA BUREAU CHIEF JOYCE
NAPIER STARTS US OFF WITH WHAT
SOME SEE AS A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
>> THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT IS
CALLING IT A TERRORIST ATTACK.
THREE ROCKETS STRIKE ON A
RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IN DONETSK
REGION KILLING AT LEAST 15
PEOPLE WITH DOZENS STILL
TRAPPED.
MORE EVIDENCE THAT THOSE
COORDINATED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS
AGAINST RUSSIA HAVEN'T HAMPERED
MOSCOW'S OFFENSIVE.
IT WAS ALL CHAOS, I WAS IN SHOCK
SAID THIS RESIDENT.
I WAS ALL COVERED IN BLOOD.
WESTERN SANCTIONS SUFFERED A
SETBACK THIS WEEKEND WHEN OTTAWA
AGREED TO RETURN TURBINES
REPAIRED IN MONTREAL THAT HAVE
BEEN TIED UP IN CANADA SINCE
THOSE SANCTIONS WERE IMPOSED.
RUSSIAN STATE CONTROLLED GAZPROM
SAYS NEEDS THEM TO SUPPLY
NATURAL GAS TO GERMANY.
>> SANCTIONS BROKEN ONCE, CAN BE
BROKEN TWICE, THREE TIMES, MANY
TIMES.
UKRAINIANS FEEL RUSSIA HAS
LEVERAGE.
>> LEVERAGE MOSCOW IS USING TO
THREATEN GERMANY AND NEIGHBOURS
THAT RELY ON RUSSIAN NATURAL

MOSCOW SAYING WITHOUT THOSE

ITS EXPORTS OF CANADA TO EUROPE.
>> KNOW THOSE GAS FLOWS WERE
TURNED DOWN PRECISELY TO TEST
THE RESOLVE OF THE WEST IN
KEEPING TO THEIR SANCTIONS
REGIME.
AND WHAT RUSSIA NOW KNOWS IS
THAT CANADA AND GERMANY BLINKED.
>> IN A STATEMENT ISSUED
YESTERDAY CANADA'S NATURAL
RESOURCES MINISTER SAID CANADA
STANDS WITH UKRAINE ADDING IT
WILL GRANT A TIME LIMITED AND
REVOKABLE PERMIT TO ALLOW THE
RETURN OF NORD STREAM TURBINE
TO GERMANY SUPPORTING
RELIABILITY TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE
ENERGY.
FOR SOME CANADIANS PROTESTING
TODAY CANADA MADE THE WRONG
MOVE.
>> ALL IT DOES IS FUEL THE BANK
ACCOUNTS OF RUSSIA WHICH THEY
USE THAT MONEY TO COMMIT
GENOCIDE IN UKRAINE.
>> OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
INCLUDING FRANCE THAT RELIES ON
RUSSIA FOR 17% OF ITS GAS SUPPLY
ARE PREPARING FOR WORSE CASE
SCENARIOS.
LET'S PREPARE FOR TOTAL CUT OFF
OF RUSSIAN GAS THE FRENCH
FINANCE MINISTER TOLD AN
ECONOMIC CONFERENCE TODAY, THAT
IS THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO.
THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT IS
CALLING ON CANADA TO REVERSE ITS
DECISION SAYING TH
