Hello cyil Hello Iran welcomes
of his operation and even goes so far as to say
that he considers this affair as
classified as closeuse yes b there we have
is we are witnessing two narratives of the two
ancestral enemies and and Iran
Iran actually you said by
the voice of his delegations to the nations
United fairly quickly to
Dawn this this morning that talks about
we will consider that it is
closed operation successful a few
well -instrumentalized manifestation in
the streets of TÃ©ran to say that we had
defeated and punished the Zionist enemy
that is to say Israel all in
invoking article 51 of the charter
of the United Nations which grants law
to self -defense referring
At the attack on April 1 which is as a
first direct huh not confirmed well
sure but we know that Israel launched
this attack on the consulate of
Syrian in Damascus killing two generals of
Guardians of the Revolution therefore this
weren't nothing so good we
Were punished the aggressor and on the side
Israeli other narrative also we
have foiled this Iranian attack
herself unprecedented in her violence in
its magnitude and in a context
extremely volatile by thwarting in
Pardoning 99 % of the shots
drone and missiles these drone shots
and missilees that had largely
been anticipable since we saw when
even that Teran has largely played for
explain that these drones left
did not leave very quickly we have
experienced it live all night and then
the unconditional American ally of
military of Israel who also affirms
by the voice of the Pentagon only on
direct orders of President Joe Biden and
a certain number of missiles and
drones were also but a big
number have been killed from
by American forces sorry at
Near East from all
FID The Mandatory Pardon Proxies
of the Iranian sphere that is to say in
from Yemen from Iraq from Iran
And then obviously from de Syria
So there on the diplomatic level we
would tend to think about this today
morning sorry that after this rise of
heat and fever in this
part of the world and everything descends
besides on the side of the White House
Finally, we are already calling halfway
to a form of de -escalation since
now what what's in
All mind is the answer
Israeli This is Benjamin's response
Itayou has this unique attack from Iran
