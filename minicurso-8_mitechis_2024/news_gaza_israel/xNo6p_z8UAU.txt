beekeepers in israel have come up with a
high-tech solution to save the dying
population of bees there's been a sharp
decline in the population of these vital
pollinators due to increased
environmental threats like habitat
destruction and climate change but can
technology really help
b home which is a project by startup b
wise in israel that houses up to 24
hives has developed a high-tech
surveillance system
that allows beekeepers to remotely treat
their hives and care for their bees
it seems like a regular home to the bees
but allows caretakers to inspect the
hive's condition more efficiently
bees are dying around the world more
than 30 of colonies die each year we
identified that issue and came up with a
technological solution as there wasn't
one we developed a robotic beehive in
which there is a beekeeping robo that
constantly monitors what is happening
inside the beehive allowing beekeepers
to receive real-time alerts and take
care of the colonies
featuring artificial intelligence bee
homes are equipped with sensors
these robotic hives are solar-powered
have adjustable temperature and can
perform various essential functions
a
the beekeeper can take action remotely
without having to physically access the
hive
he can monitor the expansion and
reduction of the hive move the honeycomb
collect honey and check on the queen's
health can basically do a general
inspection of the hive and its
conditions
traditional hives called langstroth box
were designed almost 150 years ago
the israeli project b wise aims to
address the inefficiencies of the common
hives and decrease the mortality rate of
bees
it was launched in 2018 and has raised
around 80 million dollars to develop its
exports about a hundred of these hives
are functional in israel
the dozen others sent to the united
states
bureau report we are wild is one
