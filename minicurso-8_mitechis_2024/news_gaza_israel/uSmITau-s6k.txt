It is the most terrible mission for me
Because the fact I knew a Palestinian
I have to pay attention to all my vit
and to testify in being of a
journalist the fact that more than 15 days
I can't wear in my arms
mom she is in the bour de la
southern border of Gaza that she she
can't stay from home because
that there are speakers there are
moment ofment she is diabetes I have
very afraid that she will die and
The fact that I attended breasts
terrible I must be very strong not
affected by people and I
must be careful because there is
no living conditions for the
I am a journalist I
represents in particular a channel not
Arab that we can not say what we want
nor to let people say what they
want to pay attention to everything m
said and very important for me it is
try to get the message across and
to witness a witness
The fact that I attended the blunder
from yesterday it was too strong for me
I try by all means not to
Uh make the shooting stop at the camera
because it is painful to be a
journalist and a Palestinian in the same
time and an immigrant for 30 years at
the stranger 10 years here I lived the
terrible moments in Algeria for 20 years
and 12 years here the terrible moments
also that death that we are there
smoke that comes out of the bodies of beings
humans you are forced not to
not power
transport a girl or a child
Before you is dying at
bombing place because you have to
Stay to turn lesimage because otherwise
You lose the message and you lose your
testimony if you try to save her
I attended a terrible of the
car of a press agency I want
not quote it is a armored car it
not wanted to transport with him the
girl because just not to
not be accused an accomplice and she
was forced to leave it
We tried to wear it but it is
She died in front of us between us
hands and and we could not transmit
This image because we cut the
Filming so it's difficult for you
to say it is 200 m from here I live I
can't with it falling from the night I
can not be able to go there every
I thank God's luck
to be always alive and it is a
very pible decision to remain always
a journalist and hide your emotions
and to be strong and be able to resist
all the
terms
