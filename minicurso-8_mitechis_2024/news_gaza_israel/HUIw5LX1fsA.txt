this rusted out tank is Israeli A Relic
from when Israel occupied parts of
Southern Lebanon back in
1996 that was a different conflict to
the one fought today between Israel and
islamist militants but this town called
kanana in Lebanon is the heartland of
one of those combatants Israel's sworn
enemy Hezbollah many world leaders have
expressed fear that the current war will
expand into to other countries some
people in Kana believe that's not only
inevitable that they're used to it and
might not be able to escape this time
this was Smoke rising from the border
Tuesday rabab YF lost her daughter in an
Israeli air strike in 2006 she says
every now and then they create a war and
you lose a family member you give birth
you don't know if the child will stay
with
you what really impacted me was an
interview with a Palestinian
child where the journalist asked him
what do you want to be when you grow
up they said in Palestine we do not grow
up they kill us if we're walking to
school they kill
us where are these children's rights
that people around the world
demand I don't understand our only
mistake is that we remained on our land
that's our only mistake
it's a mistake because we chose to
protect our land just like any other
person living on their land in another
country in Europe or
America Kan claims to be where Jesus
performed his Miracle of turning water
into wine in the Christian Bible it's
also a stronghold for Hezbollah which is
both an armed faction and political
force in the country the crossfire has
had devastating results in the past the
air strike in 2006 that took yousef's
daughter killed 28 people half of them
children Israel said at the time it was
a mistake an artillery strike in 96 hit
a un peacekeeping base here killing over
a hundred people Sheltering there most
of those women and children Israel
voiced regret at that incident which
prompted it to wind down that
operation Jam salame survived D the UN
base and is now a security guard at the
monument to it a constant reminder of
the collateral damage in war he's saying
these are mass
grades we know their names but we don't
have their
bodies
