terorism for a tract called to
peace I I call the responsibility
civilian victims but nothing should
prevent Israel from defending itself and then
then either in this same consult
nations for peace stop fire
immediate because we had not refused
to use the word organization
terrorist because we deny or because
that we would minimize the severity of this
which happened on October 7 which
Has it happened on October 7.
in our humanity is abominable I
have no bad problems say those and
Those who think the war has
started on October 7 commit a
political fault and
moral we are in the back of a
colonial war and if we do not say it
not as such that it is then we do not
Can't put the words on what
is happening and then we
cannot think of the conditions of
there
[Applause]
peace
Only one message must come from the concert
nations cessz fire is a
message that comes to us from the secretary
general of the United Nations of the Pope or
Loula who chairs the Security Council
nations
united the world is today in state
of choc
[Applause]
Yeah also something extremely
dangerous who has surprised
a lot I find it extremely
shocking that president of
the National Assembly leave before
Debate that organized in the Assembly
national in Israel hold
words that go in the same direction of this
that she had said about support
unconditional in Israel and I
say we will not get up for that and
I am proud that we are the only one
parliamentary group not to have
applauded something that in something
sort gives a whiteness to the government
from Netanah I will never regret
to have been from the peace and
those who keep saying
that must be called and that is the voice
of France is the one she should
hold on the immediate fire on
President of the Republic went to
Israel and the Modor Princip to have
voice like Jacquesir to have voices
as
Dominique yes in a sense it weakens
the movement when when we have
seemed to be in a way as
other movements or political parties
I think that that is indeed that
it sometimes does not contribute to the
readability of our
positions
