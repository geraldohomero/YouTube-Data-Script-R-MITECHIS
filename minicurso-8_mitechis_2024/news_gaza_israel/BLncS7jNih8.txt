>>> EYE LAN RAN LAUNCHES DOZENS
OF WEAPONIANIZED DRONES INSIDE
ISRAEL.
THEY CONFIRM THE ATTACK HAS
BEGUN.
THE MOVE FULFILLS IRAN'S PROMISE
TO RETALIATE AGAINST ISRAEL,
ACCUSING IT OF BOMBING IRAN'S
EMBASSY IN SYRIA EARLIER THIS
MONTH.
THE ATTACK KILLED SEVERAL TOP
MILITARY OFFICIALS.
RIGHT NOW PRESIDENT BIDEN IS
RUSHING BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE
FROM DELAWARE FOR MEETINGS WITH
HIS NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.
JUST YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT,
ONCE AGAIN, VOWED TO SUPPORT
ISRAEL AGAINST AN IRANIAN
ATTACK.
ADD, THE U.S. HAS WARSHIPS IN
THE REGION TO PROTECT ISRAEL AND
AMERICAN FORCE THERE'S.
LET'S GET RIGHT TO RICHARD ENGEL
IF JERUSALEM.
RICHARD, WEAPONIZED DRONES.
THESE COULD TAKE SOME TIME TO
REACH ISRAEL.
>> THIS IS A SLOW MOTION ATTACK
THAT ISRAELI OFFICIALS SAY IS
UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW.
THEY SAY THAT DRONES WERE
LAUNCHED FROM INSIDE IRANIAN
TERRITORY.
THEY NEED TO TRAVEL FROM IRAN TO
ISRAEL.
AND THAT COULD TAKE MANY HOURS.
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT KIND OF DRONES
THEY ARE, HOW FAST THEY ARE
FLYING.
BUT THE EXPECTATION IN THIS
COUNTRY IS THAT IT COULD TAKE
FOUR, FIVE, OR EVEN SIX HOURS
BEFORE THEY ENTER INTO ISRAELI
AIRSPACE.
MAKING IT QUITE EASY FOR ISRAEL
TO SHOOT THEM DOWN, ISRAEL HAS
BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS KIND OF
ATTACK.
THE ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY IS ISSUING WARNINGS.
THE U.S. BEEFED UP THE DEFENSES.
THE COMMANDER OF CENTCOM IS
HERE.
DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL FROM U.S.
EMBASSIES ARE TOLD NOT TO LEAVE
MAJOR CITIES INCLUDING JERUSALEM
AND TEL AVIV.
BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS ARE
THESE DRONES ON THEIR WAY NOW TO
ISRAEL ACCORDING TO THE ISRAELI
MILITARY?
THE ONLY PART OF THIS ATTACK AND
IN A STATEMENT THAT WAS
TELEVISED HERE IN ISRAEL, A
MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THE
ATTACK IS UNDER WAY.
THE ISRAELI PUBLIC SHOULD TAKE
IT SERIOUSLY.
THAT IF THEY -- IF THE AIR RAID
SIRENS DO GO OFF, SUGGESTING
THEY MAY NOT GO OFF IF THE
DRONES ARE DESTROYED BEFORE THEY
ENTER ISRAELI AIRSPACE, THAT
PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE COVER.
STAY THERE FOR THE ALEAST TEN
MINUTES.
AND THAT IF THERE ARE -- AT
LEAST TEN MINUTES.
AND IF THERE ARE OTHER ATTACKS
THAT PUBLIC WILL BE INFORMED.
>> RICHARD ENGEL IN JERUSALEM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT CONCLUDES THIS NBC NEWS
SPECIAL REPORT.
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON OUR
STREAMING NETWORK, NBCNEWSNOW,
