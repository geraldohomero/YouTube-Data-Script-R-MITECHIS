>>> THE MILITARY IN ISRAEL'S 
THAT THEY ARE ENGAGED IN  
COMBAT AND THAT THEY HAVE 
KILLED DOZENS OF MILITANTS OVER 
THE PAST DAY, AS THE FIGHTING 
RAGES ON IN GAZA. 
MEANWHILE, HAS BELLA HEZBOLLAH 
HAS BEEN LAUNCHING ATTACKS . 
>> Reporter: ISRAEL IS NOT AT 
WAR  WITH LEBANON, BUT EVERY DAY
EXPLOSIONS ECHO AND THEY TRADE 
FIRE WITH HEZBOLLAH FIGHTERS . 
THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST 
REMAINING RESIDENTS OF THIS 
FARMING VILLAGE. 
450 PEOPLE ONCE LIVED HERE. THE 
COMMUNITY WAS EVACUATED ON 
GOVERNMENT ORDERS. HE HAS 
CHICKENS AND FRUIT ORCHARDS BUT 
IS ALSO PART OF A SECURITY TEAM 
THAT STAYED BEHIND DIRECTLY IN 
THE LINE OF FIRE. THEY COULD 
FIRE AT ANY TIME, AND THEY DO. 
HEZBOLLAH  HAS AMASSED WEAPONS 
AND NOW ISRAEL'S DEFENSE 
MINISTER  HAS DEPLOYED MORE 
TROOPS IN PREPARATION FOR WHAT 
COMES NEXT. 
>> ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THIS 
COULD OPEN UP A NEW FRONT IN 
THE WAR? 
>> I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A 
PROBLEM WITH HEZBOLLAH BUT WE 
DO NOT KNOW WHEN . 
>> Reporter: THOSE LIVING NEAR 
THE BORDER IN BOTH ISRAEL AND 
LEBANON  HAVE BEEN DISPLACED 
FOLLOWING THE OCTOBER 7 ATTACK. 
>> WE DO KNOW THAT PRIME 
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS 
BEEN UNDER PRESSURE AND HOW 
PREPARED  IS ISRAEL? 
>> Reporter:  THE FIRST THING IS
WILL THEY GO TO WORK? 
IT'S MAKE IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS 
INEVITABLE AND THE DEFENSE 
MINISTER SAID THERE IS MORE 
TROOPS ALONG THE BORDER THAT 
WOULD VERY SOON GO INTO ACTION 
AND STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING HOW 
MANY TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED BUT 
THIS CAME STRAIGHT AFTER THE 
ARMY CHIEF WARNED THAT THE RISK 
HAD BECOME HIGHER. MANY SAY A 
WAR WITH HEZBOLLAH IS  
INEVITABLE. IT IS REGARDED WITH 
SOPHISTICATED TRAINING BUT THEY 
DO NOT REALLY HAVE THE APPETITE 
FOR A WAR AND SAY THEY 
UNDERESTIMATE WHAT COULD BE A 
VERY DANGEROUS THREAT. IT DOES 
NOT APPEAR ON THE SURFACE AT 
LEAST THAT THEY HAVE THE 
APPETITE, DESPITE THE WARNING 
THAT IF ISRAEL WERE TO WAGE WAR 
AGAINST THEM  IT WOULD BE 
COSTLY. 
ISRAEL IS FAR MORE  PROTECTIVE. 
THEY CAN GET OVERWHELMED AND 
MANY LIVE IN HOMES THAT ARE 
FORTIFIE
