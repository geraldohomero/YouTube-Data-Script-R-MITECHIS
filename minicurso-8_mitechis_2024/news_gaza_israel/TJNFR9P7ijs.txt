titles are welcome if you
We join on France 24 the end of
Bombings and rocket fire
A first quiet night therefore at
close to the ceasefire has been
negotiated by Egypt is therefore
Maybe the end of a war on the balance sheet
very heavy 232 dead on the Palestinian side
12 Israeli side but this truce
can she hold
Clashes have been reported there
A little over an hour now on
the mosques esplanade you see it
on these images and this is where
Our special Gallagher Fenwick envoy
listened to it remains tense and volatile
This is proof that the cease
fire that is underway and fragile
Since you have to remember it
Events and last 11 days
We have proven it to many recovery are
connected, it is therefore necessary to monitor the
Land situation in the band
of Gaza on the Israeli side near
The Palestinian Local
But not only in the West Bank and
Especially here even in Jerusalem is just
behind me the door of Damascus who these
last days has seen clashes

What is the Al-Aqsa mosque

of this old town of Jerusalem that
is precisely the emotional heart
of this conflict and each of the two parties
It is a dramatic event
could jeopardize this agreement this
Stop fire is potentially doing
REBUCTULL THE SITUATION in violence
For the moment we seem to have returned to
Calm Camelin Pardon rather precarious
But we see nothing is totally
settled and the situation is still a
times as I told you very
fragile in the field
