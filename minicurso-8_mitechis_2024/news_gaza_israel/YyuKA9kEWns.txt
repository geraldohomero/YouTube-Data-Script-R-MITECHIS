WE CAN GIVE OUR BEST ADVICE AND
OUR BEST JUDGMENT AGAIN ABOUT
HOW THEY DO IT AND ALSO HOW BEST
TO ACHIEVE THE RESULTS THAT
THEY'RE SEEKING.
>> I WANT TO TRY TO GET SOME
CLARITY FROM YOU ABOUT THE WATER
SITUATION IN GAZA.
AS YOU KNOW, ISRAEL DECIDED TO
CUT OFF WATER TO GAZA ALONG WITH
THE FUEL ELECTRICITY THAT POWERS
THE WATER AND SEWAGE PLANTS IN
THE TERRITORY, AND THAT HAS
EXPOSED RESIDENTS TO ALL SORTS
OF POTENTIAL CONTAMINATED WATER
AND SICKNESS AS WELL.
WHAT WAS THE STRATEGY BEHIND
THAT AND CAN YOU CLARIFY, HAS
ANY OF THE WATER BEEN RESTORED,
MR. SECRETARY?
>> SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING ON FROM
VIRTUALLY FROM THE BEGINNING.
WHEN I WAS IN ISRAEL AND
THROUGHOUT THE REGION AS YOU
MENTIONED A LITTLE WHILE AGO,
ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS VERY
FOCUSED ON WAS MAKING SURE THAT
PEOPLE IN GAZA, INNOCENT PEOPLE
WHO ARE CAUGHT IN THIS THROUGH
NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, IN THIS
CROSS FIRE OF HAMAS' MAKING GET
THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED.
WHETHER IT'S FOOD, WHETHER IT'S
MEDICINE, WHETHER IT'S WATER,
AND SO WE WERE ABLE --
>> HAS ANY OF IT BEEN RESTORED,
MR. SECRETARY?
>> IN SHORT, YES.
IN SHORT, YES.
TWO THINGS.
FIRST, THERE ARE MULTIPLE
PIPELINES.
ISRAEL TURNED ON ONE OF THE
PIPELINES SIX OR SEVEN DAYS AGO
SO THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP
AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER
PIPELINES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO
SEE RESTORED.
IN ADDITION, WATER IS COMING IN.
WE HAD THE FIRST 20 TRUCKS OF
ASSISTANCE COME IN, THAT
INCLUDES WATER.
WE ARE GETTING MORE THAT WE HOPE
WILL BE MOVING AS EARLY AS
TODAY.
IN FACT, WE WERE JUST TOLD THAT
SOME OF THE CONVOYS HAD STARTED
TO MOVE AGAIN AND ARE MOVING AS
WE SPEAK.
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE
OTHER THINGS THAT NEED TO
HAPPEN.
THERE ARE DESALINATION PLANTS
THAT NEED TO BE POWERED IN ORDER
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WATER
PEOPLE ARE DRINKING IS CLEAN.
WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE
SPREAD OF DISEASE AS A RESULT OF
PEOPLE DRINKING DIRTY WATER.
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE VERY
MUCH PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING
EVERY DAY TO TRY TO MAKE SURE
PALESTINIANS HAVE THE ASSISTANCE
WE NEED.
WE,A POINTED A VERY SENIOR
DIPLOMAT, DAVID SATTERFIELD TO
BE ON THE GROUND EVERY DAY
WORKING TO MAKE SURE THE
