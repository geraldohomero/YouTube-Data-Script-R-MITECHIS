Joe Biden's words are perfectly
Clear Hamas this organization
terrorist is currently attacking the state
of Israel the fact that Hamas takes
the initiative of this operation facilitates
in the background the task of Joe Biden in
his communication that does not need
temper your support the objective of
White House is therefore clear and assume
Everything must be implemented for
support the Israeli army neither more
less and especially the efforts
diplomatic necessary for isolation
Total of Hamas on the stage
international and in the region we have
heard Joe Biden warns them
nations that would be trying not to
present clear support and assumed to
The state of Israel Joe Biden was
Accompanied by Anthony Blinen the chief of
American diplomacy a little earlier
During the day it's Lloyd Austin the
Minister of Defense who had formulated
almost equivalent statements
Not a single word for a call to stop
The fire not a single word to for
Asking for de -escalation is it
clearly not the time it's time
of war and America will be held
side of Israel and we guess that this
support will also be military since
We are thinking in particular of the ammunition of which
will soon need the military
Israelis who defend
Israeli aerial against requests
Hamas but not just the
Israeli information will receive the
support from its American ally Hamas
who of everyone's life here has gone too much
far and must therefore expect fire to
hell I quote these are the words of
Some Pentagon Chiefs of Staff
the life of the inhabitants of Gaza in
next days and the next
weeks will be harder than ever we
understood here he is no doubt
that no one in the Western world has
will oppose the army project
Israeli to completely destroy this
times the armed branch of Hamas and again
Once these are words that are
hammered by army communicators
Israeli and which resonates in a loop
Here on anyway on the channels
American information
