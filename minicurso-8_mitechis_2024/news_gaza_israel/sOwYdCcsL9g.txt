to talk a bit more about all of this
with me now let's go live to jerusalem
with france 24s
gallagher fenwick gallagher what's the
latest from there
well as you mentioned there is a bit of
respite
although the confrontation does continue
in the form of israeli air raids
artillery fire
and rockets coming out of gaza headed
towards israel which caused for sirens
to ring out
in the southern parts of the country
israel
continues to target military leaders
namely those of
uh armed factions such as the al-qasam
brigades the armed
arm of hamas which rules the gaza strip
and islamic jihad leaders
as well we spoke a little bit earlier
with an israeli official telling us that
uh
victory has not yet been achieved and
when you speak to israeli officials
victory for them
uh means uh deterrence and so
a seizing or certainly a substantial
calming down of the rocket fire which
continues to be incessant
at this point overnight according to uh
israeli officials but also israeli
commentators notably
journalists who regularly comment on
activities of the israeli military tens
of air raids have been conducted
remember that israel is really going
after what they call hamas metro system
that is a
complex network of underground tunnels
which israel claims is being used by
militants
in order to conduct attacks uh and fire
rockets in the direction of uh
israel again there's no immediate sign
of any kind of
a substantial abatement or baiting
of the violence but the rockets do seem
to be heading
a little less further into israeli
territory if that's any kind of an
indication
gallagher thanks for that that's
gallagher fenwick there reporting live
from
jerusalem
