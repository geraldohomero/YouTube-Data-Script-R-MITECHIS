So today the big question is that if ever on India
If there is such an attack, is the ruling party in India
And the leaders of the opposition will ever come together
In Israel, the ruling party and the opposition of Hamas
It is united against against but this war on the other side
Give our entire India to our India
We have divided into parts too
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not united
Has called Hamas fighters a terrorist
They did not wrap anyone straight into it
Described them as terrorists and Israel
He came and stood in support but
But the Congress party today of Palestine
Delhi has stood in support today
Congress Working Committee met in
In which Congress passed a proposal
The party said that it is Palestine
The land of Muslims is their self -esteem and
They have their own for life rights
It supports that the Government of India is Israel
But with Congress Palestine
Is with Muslims and this war has led to India
Divide the people of two torso
Aligarh Muslim of Uttar Pradesh has been given
Some students at the university tomorrow
Open march in support of Palestine
Removed and supported them and now this matter
Police also case against four students
Record this picture has been recorded

Reached and there was a lot of uproar there
