WAY TO ISRAEL AFTER ATTENDING
MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
ONCE THERE, SHE IS EXPECTED TO
MEET WITH DIPLOMATIC LEADERS
THE WAR.
>>> AS THIS WAR CONTINUES TO
INTENSIFY, SO DO
DEMONSTRATIONS. TONIGHT SUPPORT
FROM BOTH SIDES STAGED DUELING
RALLIES IN THE CITY.
>> Reporter: TWO RALLIES
BEHIND ME STARTED ON DIFFERENT
SIDES OF THE PARK AND NOW
THEY'RE FACE TO FACE.
>> FREE, FREE PALESTINE.
>> BRING THEM HOME.
>> Reporter: CHANTING FROM
BOTH SIDES AND FLAGS WAVED,
PROTESTERS SUPPORTING THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND DIRECTLY
IN FRONT OF THEM PEOPLE
RALLYING FOR ISRAEL. THE PRO
ISRAEL RALLY WAS ORGANIZED BY
NYU STUDENTS. WE SPOKE TO ONE
YOUNG MAN WHO WAS STUDYING IN
ISRAEL WHEN THE ATTACK BY HAMAS
TERRORISTS OCCURRED. HE FINALLY
MADE HIS WAY HOME A FEW DAYS
AGO. THOSE IN SUPPORT OF THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
VERY VOCAL ABOUT FREEING THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THE
YEARS OF PERSECUTION THEIR
PEOPLE HAVE FACED. THEY'RE
CALLING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY
BELIEVE TO BE GENOCIDE
HAPPENING IN GAZA RIGHT NOW.
THIS DUELING RALLY IS IN CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO THE NYU CAMPUS AS
THE NYPD INTEL DIVISION IS
MONITORING SOCIAL MEDIA
POSTINGS FOR ANY POTENTIAL
THREATS. BOTH SIDES RALLIED
PEACEFULLY WHILE RESPECTING
EACH OTHER'S SPACE. ONE THING
THEY HAVE IN COMMON HERE,
PRAYING FOR THEIR PEOPLE AND A
STOP TO THE ATROCITIES
HAPPENING AROUND THEM.
>> HAMAS OPENED THE WAR AGAINST
ISRAEL. I DON'T THINK THERE IS
ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT
WOULD ACCEPT SUCH ATROCITIES
AGAINST THEIR CIVILIANS.
>> WE'RE NOT SUPPORTING
VIOLENCE. WE'RE HERE TO TALK
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. THEY'VE
BEEN SUFFERING FOR 75 YEARS AND
THE INCIDENTS ARE NOT HAPPENING
IN A VACUUM.
