We will find the correspondent of
France 24 Serge Berberry which is at
Beyouth in Lebanon Hello Serge so he
Yesterday there were new strikes
Israeli reprisal in the south of
Lebanon in reprisal I told you
So at Hzbollah shots the situation
seems to have calmed down but it must be said
that the tension is always very lively HE
near the border with
Israel listen to this morning it's a calm
precarious which reigns south of Lebanon at the
border therefore Lebanese-Israeli
latest shooting exchanges took place
Yesterday at the end of the day uh three civilians
were injured and material damage
were recorded uh a tank
local water was also affected and
fires have spread to
fields which must especially remember
Well it is the confusion that reigns in
permanence on the blue line several
false alerts have trained and
long tension and mobilization of
two sides of the border uh it was the
case by for example last night when
information reported
possible infiltration by air
for more than 2 hours the tension was at
his highest point at the end of the evening
Tsal finally indicated that none
air infiltration had not taken place in
origin from
Lebanon in this context and the army
Lebanese and the finish multiplies
patrols along the blue line
To avoid climbing and prevent
new rocket fire in
direction
of Israel the Lebanese army has located
A quest launch pad
Installed by the armed branch of Hamas
The structure was neutralized the
situation in Southliban should be at
Government menu today this
afternoon if it manages to come together because
Since the end of Michel Haoun's mandate
well several ministers are reluctant to
Participate in the firm sessions
causing several cororum defects
Serge Berberry from Beyouth for
France 24 Thank you very much
