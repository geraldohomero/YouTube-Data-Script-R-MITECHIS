previously our correspondent in Iran
Catalina Gómez Ángel extended us to
regarding a not very common procedure
In Iran Iranian television made public
A guard of the Guard
Revolutionary in which he announced the
Response to Israeli attack to the Consulate
Iranian in the capital Syria Damascus the
April first who left as dead
These seven guard officers
revolutionaries between them three high
officers in him assured that they were
responding with both drones and
Missile what we know so far
is that a wave of drones exceeded
Iraq many of them fly over
Shiite Religious Capital De Iraq
kerbala all these videos have come out in
social networks especially in
Telegram channels and would already be in
Syrian territory also start
appear videos in which the
Silvated from missiles in the middle of the
night also crosses territory
Iraqi remember that it has
presence a large group of militias
Iran allies known as the hash
Al Shavi and that really are part of
That axis of resistance
Images are also arrived from Tehran
Where there are rows of people supplying
especially of gasoline us
We are currently in Jram Bad is
One is the capital of the province of
Lorestán 200 km from the border with
Iraq a city from where they launched
The missiles in 2020 when they will go
responded to the murder of the general
Kassen Soleimani who was the commander
Before the Scots forces on that occasion
launched these missiles against a base
American in Iraq right now
really here in this part of the country the
night is quiet however there is
Many cars in the street but I know
knows that many of the drones and missiles
They would have been launched from cities
Around there is also the awareness of
that if you follow the strategy that will go
Eh has been forgiven that Russia has continued
In Ukraine the missiles would arrive later
of drones when they have achieved
overwhelm or have achieved at least
Test the anti -aircraft defense in
This Israeli case so it is one night
very long not only in Israel but
also in Iran where the population is
Waiting for what can happen
