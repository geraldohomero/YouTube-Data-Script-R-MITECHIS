TALK TO US ABOUT
THE UNITED STATES RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE MIDDLE EAST. IN THE
PROCESS OF SORTING OUT THE
REFUGEES, SORTING OUT THE
HOSTILITIES AND THE HOSTAGE
NEGOTIATIONS, THE SUMMIT IN
OMAN WAS CANCELED.
WHEN THE GROUND
OFFENSIVE WAS FIRST BROUGHT UP.
LEADERS FROM SAUDI ARABIA HAVE
NOT BEEN SPEAKING WITH
PRESIDENT BIDEN.
THE YOU FEEL LIKE THE MIDDLE
EAST AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE
BEEN LOSING THE PARTNERSHIP
WHICH HAS BEEN BUILT UP FOR
DECADES? H.R.:
YOU ARE RIGHT FOR THE CRITICAL
BATTLEGROUND IS THE
BATTLEGROUND OF PERCEPTION, AND
THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO
KEEP TALKING ABOUT OCTOBER 7
THEN TALKING ABOUT THE NATURE
OF HAMAS. AGAIN, IF YOU ARE
PRO-PALESTINIAN, YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE ANTI-HAMAS, AND I WISH
THAT THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE
REGION WOULD DO A BETTER JOB
COMMUNICATING TO THEIR OWN
PEOPLE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE
PROBLEM THAT ISRAEL FACES.
I BELIEVE IN THE LONG-TERM, OUR
INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE
GULF STATES, ARE ALIGNED WITH
ISRAEL'S ARAB NEIGHBORS BECAUSE
THE HAND BEHIND THIS IS IRAN.
IRAN IS USING THESE PROXY
FORCES TO EXECUTE WHAT IT CALLS
ITS RING OF FIRE STRATEGY TO
DESTROY ISRAEL.
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK
AT THE STATEMENTS BY HAMAS AND
ALSO LOOK AT THE STATEMENTS BY
IRANIAN LEADERS, ESPECIALLY
THIS SUPREME LEADER, AND IT IS
CLEAR TO ME THAT IRAN IS USING
THESE PROXY FORCES TO CREATE A
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN THE
REGION, HERE BETWEEN HAMAS AND
ISRAEL, BUT ELSEWHERE IN THE
REGION BETWEEN VARIOUS MILITIAS
AND SUNNI ARAB GROUPS IN SYRIA.
THEY HAVE PERPETUATED THIS
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AND EPISODES
OF MASS HOMICIDE IN THE SYRIAN
CIVIL WAR.
HAVE PERPETUATED THE CIVIL WAR
IN YEMEN AND ARE SUPPORTING THE
HOUTHIS.
THEY HAVE BEEN ATTACKING OUR
FORCES, AND NOW THEY HAVE
EVERYTHING THE WAY THEY WANT IT
FROM TEHRAN'S PERSPECTIVE WITH
THE PROTESTS IN ARAB CAPITALS.
WHAT IRAN WANTS TO DO IS KEEP
THE ARAB WORLD PERPETUALLY WEAK
AND ENMESHED IN CONFLICT SO IT
CAN PLACE PROXY ARMIES ON THE
BORDER OF ISRAEL.
THEY ARE EXECUTING THAT
STRATEGY, CREATING THIS
REGIONAL WAR.
WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS DONE
TO GO TO ISRAEL, TO POSITION
ADDITIONAL U.S.
FORCES THERE TO DETER AN
ESCALATION, BUT I THINK THIS IS
SADLY A CONFLICT THAT IS LIKELY
TO ESCALATE AT LEAST WITHIN THE
REGION.
