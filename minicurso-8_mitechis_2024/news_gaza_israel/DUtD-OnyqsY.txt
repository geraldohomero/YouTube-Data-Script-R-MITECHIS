find Claire du Hamel our
correspondent in Jerusalem that
Do you know about this Israeli raid on
Nasser Hospital in Ranunnes in the band
of
Gaza Hello and a priori the army
Israeli is still in the hospital
This morning the Ministry of Health
controlled by Hamas said four
patients were killed for lack of oxygen
This is information that was to us
confirmed by the United Nations who says
that at least three patients died
tonight and then according to Jamie
McGoldrick who is therefore the coordinator
humanitarian actions of
The UN The hospital is now completely
to fuel courtyard while
patients they are therefore always the UN
would have had the authorization this morning of
replenish this hospital in
fuel and then the Israeli army has
also communicated she said she had
arrested dozens of people in
This Al Nasser Hospital, including 20 which are
accused of having taken part in the massacre of
October 7 We know the Israeli army
consider that hostage bodies
could be in this hospital
Al Nasser even if for the moment no
information in this sense was published
And then this operation it takes place
in the context of the threats of a
large -scale land operation
Rafa therefore further south we know that
This is where nearly 1.5 takes refuge
million inappropriate civilians who
followed up in conditions
particularly humanitarian workers
disastrous and criticism
international against Israel is
in this context, multiply Joe Biden a
said that Benyamin Netanahou told Benyamin that
the United States may not support
an Israeli terrestrial operation if
This does not take into account a plan
credible to evacuate civilians but the
Israeli Prime Minister repeated it
Israel intends to go to the end in
Rafa's land invasion project
Thank you very much Claire Duamel for all
