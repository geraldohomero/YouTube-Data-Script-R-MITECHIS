[Applause]
anyone from leaving the
building building You Can't Hide we you
with genocide okay we're going to do a
little little little Wilder speaker
comes okay
[Music]
cuz
uh so I'm here for the NHS I'm an a
doctor and I'm also here as part of
health workers for a free Palestine
Palante is a uh military technology
company basically and they've got very
very sketchy past present and probably
future um they're heavily involved in um
Israeli military technology and they are
openly supporting this genocide and
supplying tech for the ongoing genocide
khaza um and the deaths of many many
Palestinians they've now
uh in November this year just signed a
Â£330 million contract with our NHS to
take control of our patient data they
are a malicious company they have been
involved in lots of surveillance stuff
in the UK um such as racial profiling in
the American Police Service and if they
have our patient data we do not trust
that they will use that ethically they
this company the CEOs and the company
itself have made many public statements
in this current genocide and previously
about how they are actually with their
technology supporting the Israeli
military with Target killings and Target
kidnappings of Palestinians who were key
in the resistance and our civilians as
[Applause]
well we are fting vict
for I'm a junior doctor um part of
health workers for a free Palestine um
we've seen in the last few decades
a gradual decimation of the NHS with
cuts and privatization on that
background when we saw what was
happening in Gaza we felt the need to
come together and show solidarity with
Palestinians responding to health
workers from palestin asking for our
solidarity the two things are linked and
paler is a brilliant example of that
it's a us-based tech firm that is
involved in spy technology across the
world is supportive and provides
technology for the Israeli
apartheid and has recently been given a
330 million contract with the NHS to
provide an overarching data
