After the role of silge of Ramas he
Play from the massacres of October 7
the role of mediator between Israel and
the terrorist organization a role that
now seems to escape Qatar
The admitted negotiations are difficult
and Doa now intends to reassess his
intermediary responsibility between
two parties according to the first
Minister Katari Instrumentization
policy of this
mediation unfortunately we have seen
that there was an abuse of this mediation
and an abuse of this mediation in favor
of close political interest that means
that Qatar called for an assessment
global of this role we are
now at this stage to assess the
mediation and also to assess the
way in which parties engage in
This mediation we are engaged there
from a humanitarian point of view but there
also has limits to this role and
limits to the capacity with which we
can contribute to these negotiations of
constructive way the Qatar will take the
Good decision at the right time at the right one
moment after more than 6 months of war
Only an agreement could have emerged between
Israel and Ramas an agreement that has
allowed the release of 110 hostages
Israelis and foreigners but 133 are
Always detained in the Gaza Strip
And for the moment the talks are at
point dead and despite several rounds of
Negotiation in Paris Doa or Ker
Hamas systematically refuses
Proposals made by the United States
And Israel Qatar reproaches Jerusalem
to denigrate its role and the results
then obtained while the last
To speak have ended in failure
Ramas providing to release only
20
hostages The case has lasted for several
months and differences are
considerable we always have
worked in close collaboration
With our partners in this
mediation that is the United States and
of Egypt to fill this ditch
submit proposals but in the end
The role of the mediator is limited I want
say there is his limits and he cannot
not bring things the games
themselves refuse
Qatar therefore seems to throw in the towel of
This role of mediator remains to be seen who
Go take its place Egypt play him
also an important mediation role
between Israel and Ramas and could
Replace Qatar if the Emirate decides
really to abandon his
responsibility while waiting for time
Press 133 Israelis are still
Hosting detainees in Gaza
