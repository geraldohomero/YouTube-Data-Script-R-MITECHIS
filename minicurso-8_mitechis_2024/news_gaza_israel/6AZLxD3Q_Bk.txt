AS ROCKET BLOOD THE SKIES ABOVE
THE COUNTRY.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
>> IN THESE GUARD TODAY, A
ROCKET GOING OVER THE ISRAELI
CITY.
YOU SEE THAT EXPLOSION?
THAT IS THE IRON DOME DEFENSE
IN ACTION.
IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE NOT MUCH
MORE THAN A BLIP IN THE SKY,
BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIEW AT
NIGHT.
EACH OF THESE EXPLOSIONS, A
ROCKET ATTACK.
THE ISRAELI COMPANY SAYS THE
SYSTEM HAS DESTROYED THOUSANDS
OF UNGUIDED ROCKET FIRED FROM
GAZA IN ISRAEL SINCE 2011.
THE IRON DOME ISN'T REALLY A
DOME. THEY ARE MOVABLE BATTERIES
THAT LOOK LIKE THIS.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
FIRST, IT'S RADAR SINCE IS A
ROCKET WHEN IT IS EATING CLOSE.
ANYWHERE FROM 2.5 TO 43 MILES
AWAY.
THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE
CONTRACTOR THAT HELP PRODUCE
THEM, AND THEN THE IRON DOME --
KICKS INTO GEAR.
IT DETERMINES THAT THE ROCKET
WILL HIT THE TOWN OR CITY, IT
WILL TELL A LAUNCHER TO SHOOT
AT THE MISSILE THAT WILL
INTERCEPT AND DESTROY IN MIDAIR.
IF A ROCKET IS HEADED FOR AN
UNPOPULATED AREA, THE IRON DOME
WILL LET IT LAND IN THE DESERT
OR SEA.
THE SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY
EFFICIENT. IT INTERCEPT THAT
MORE THAN 95 PERCENT OF ROCKETS
DURING AN OPERATION LAST MAY.
4500 ROCKETS WERE FIRED FROM
GAZA, AND THE IRON DOME HAS
INTERCEPTED MANY.
>> WE ARE HEARING IT AGAIN.
YOU START TO SEE THE IRON DON'T
YOU START TO SEE THE IRON DON'T
CYST THEM -- IRON DOME SYSTEM.
>> IT DOESN'T CATCH EVERY
SINGLE ONE.
THE U.S. HAS GIVEN ISRAEL
NEARLY $2 BILLION FOR THE IRON
DOME SINCE 2011.
THAT IS IN ADDITION TO THE $2.3
BILLION THAT IS SINCE FOR
GENERAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE.
TODAY, PRESIDENT BIDEN PLEDGING
EVEN MORE SUPPORT.
>> INCLUDING AMMUNITION AND
INTERCEPTORS TO REPLENISH IRON
DOME.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY DO
