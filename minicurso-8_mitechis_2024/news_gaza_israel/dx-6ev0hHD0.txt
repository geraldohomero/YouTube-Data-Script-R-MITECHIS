Immediately Stéphane Amar our
corresponding to Jerusalem Hello
Stéphane we just saw the latter
point in image and these bombings which
who continue we mentioned at the end
the resumption of these negotiations between
Israel and and Hamas what does it give
exactly and it seemed that it was
specifies the chief of the mossade the services
Israeli secrets would have met where
should meet in the next
hours his Qatarive Barsovi counterpart in
Poland to actually put in
point a new truce a truce which
would lead to the release of hostage as
It was the case 3 weeks ago but
also at the release of prisoners
Palestinians is of course linked to what
happened in the Gaza Strip this
Saturday with the Israeli army which has
thoroughly killed three Israeli hostages
which were in the Gaza Strip
It has created a lot of emotion and it
therefore put pressure on the government
Israel who now wants
accelerate his negotiations for a
truce and hostage release
Israeli against prisoners
Palestinians H is that going this
file change the way of or not of
make war so there is
undoubtedly a debate in Israel
of course there was this case which has
traumatized opinion there have been several
manifestations since the death of these
Three hostages in the Gaza Strip there
has a certain impression
Israelis because every day I say
well every day and well there are
lists of dead soldiers who are
broadcast by the media and that of course
plays a lot on the morale of the
population that said it must be said according to
Opinion surveys and everything
simply according to what we feel here
in the street in the field by speaking
with people it must be said that there is
always a very clear majority
Israelis who wishes the prosecution
fights that wish to pursue
fights I also specify it under this
form that is to say a kind of struggle
relentless we saw it in the report
against Hamas at risk itself
obviously touching the population
Palestinian civilian for Israelis
There is only one priority is
to eliminate the armed branch of Hamas
