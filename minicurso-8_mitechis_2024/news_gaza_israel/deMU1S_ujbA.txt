 
AND ONE GAME AWAY FROM 
ELIMINATION.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS 
MORNING.
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS 
CLAIMING VICTIM IN MARIUPOL, 
THE BESIEGED UKRANIAN CITY 
WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE REMAIN TRAINED.
IN A TELEVISED MEETING WITH HIS
DEFENCE MINISTER HE CALLED OFF 
A FINAL CONFRONTATION WITH THE 
DEFENDERS HOLDING OUT INSIDE A 
GIANT STEEL PLANT.
DANIELE HAMAMDJIAN IS IN L'VIV 
WITH THE LATEST ON THE 
SITUATION.
>> Reporter: VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS
DECLARED MARIUPOL EFFECTIVELY 
LIBERATED EVEN THOUGH RUSSIAN 
TROOPS STILL DON'T HAVE FULL 
CONTROL OF THE STEEL PLANT.
THAT IS WHERE UP TO 2,500 
UKRANIAN FIGHTERS, THEY SAY, 
ARE HOLED UP.
VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID IT WAS 
IMPRACTICAL TO STORM THE STEEL 
PLANT AND CALLED OFF THE ORDER,
INSTEADING ORDERING THE TROOPS 
TO BLOCK IT OFF, SEAL IT 
PREVENT ESCAPING.
YOU MIGHT RECALL YESTERDAY ONE 
OF THE MARINE COMMANDERS PUT 
OUT A VIDEO ASKING WORLD 
LEADERS FOR HELP FOR AN 
EXTRACTION PLAN FOR AN 
EVACUATION.
THERE WERE 500 SOLDIERS INJURED
AND THE HUNDREDS OF CIVILIANS 
THAT ARE THERE.
THIS IS A MASSIVE INDUSTRIAL 
AREA.
THIS IS 11 SQUARE KILOMETRES OF
UNDERGROUND PASSAGES AND 
AMMUNITION IS RUNNING LOW AND 
THEY WILL RUN OUT.
WATER, FOOD, MEDICINE IS ALSO 
RUNNING LOW.
SO IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME 
NOW.
THERE WERE HOPES THAT 6,000 
CIVILIANS WOULD BE ABLE TO 
EVACUATE YESTERDAY FROM THE 
CITY ITSELF.
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.
WE UNDERSTAND OVER THE PAST 24 
HOURS THERE WERE A TOTAL OF SIX
BUSES.
SO A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE DID 
MANAGE TO ESCAPE BUT NOT THE 
6,000 THAT WERE HOPED FOR.
THERE WERE CALLS BY THE U.N. TO
ESTABLISH A CEASE-FIRE OVER THE
NEXT TWO DAYS TO COINCIDE WITH 
THE EASTER ORTHODOX WEEKEND 
CELEBRATED HERE AND IN RUSSIA.
THAT PROPOSAL TODAY
