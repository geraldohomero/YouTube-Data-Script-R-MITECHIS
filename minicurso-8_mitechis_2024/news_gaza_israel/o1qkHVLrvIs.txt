 
ARE GOING TO START IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST. 
MAJORED OF ELEMENTS OQUIRRH. 
THREE PALESTINIAN GUNMEN OPENED 
FIRE IN THE WEST BANK NEAR 
JERUSALEM AND AT LEAST ONE 
PERSON WAS KILLED AND EIGHT 
OTHERS WENT IT IN THE ATTACK 
AND TWO OF THE GUNMAN WAS SHOT 
AND KILLED AND THE THIRD 
ARRESTED. 
JENNY HILL AT THE BBC  HAS BEEN 
FOLLOWING ALL OF THIS FOR US 
AND WHAT DO WE KNOW SO FAR 
ABOUT THIS ATTACK? 
>> Reporter:  POLICEMAN HAVE 
SAID THAT THE GUNMAN TARGETED 
EARLY MORNING COMMUTERS AS THEY 
SAT IN THE CAR WAITING TO GO 
THROUGH THE CHECKPOINT. 
THIS PIECE OF ROAD IS NOTORIOUS 
FOR TRAFFIC JAMS AS PEOPLE TRY 
TO CROSS OVER INTO JERUSALEM 
AND THEY WERE ARMED WITH 
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND BEGAN 
FIRING AT THE CARS. 
THE MEN ARE PALESTINIAN AND 
HAVE COME FROM THE  BETHLEHEM 
AREA. 
THE ISRAEL  WAR IN GAZA HAS 
REALLY INTENSIFIED EXISTING 
UTILITY. 
IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT 
SO MANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ARE 
TRYING TO BRING SOME SORT OF 
RESOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT BUT 
THE OTHER REASON IS THAT THERE 
IS INCREASING GLOBAL ALARM 
ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN COST OF 
THIS WAR AND OVERNIGHT ISRAELI 
AIR STRIKES CONTINUED IN GAZA 
AND 100 PEOPLE DIED  DURING 
THOSE ISRAELI AIR STRIKES . 
>> OF COURSE THIS IS HAPPENING 
AS THERE IS AN ATTEMPT AT 
DIPLOMACY. 
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S METAL HIS 
CONVOY BRETT McGURK WILL TALK 
ABOUT A HOSTAGE RELEASE AND 
PRETTY THINGS  STAND? 
>> Reporter: IT IS HARD TO SAY 
IN THE POLITICAL  LEADER OF 
HAMAS WAS SPEAKING WITH 
EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS AND WE DO 
HAVE SOME WORD  FROM BENNY 
GANTZ WHO SAID THAT THE 
PRELIMINARY SIGNS WERE THAT 
THERE MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE 
MOVEMENT TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF SOME KIND OF DEAL . THE DEAL 
BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS OF COURSE 
TO SECURE A SIX WEEK TEMPORARY 
CEASE-FIRE AND RELEASE OF 
HOSTAGES BEFORE RAMADAN. THE 
PRESSURE IS ON BECAUSE THE 
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS INSISTED 
UNLESS THOSE HOSTAGES RETURNED 
IT WILL LAUNCH A GROUND 
OFFENSIVE IN THE SOUTHERN CITY 
OF RAFAH. 
THERE IS 1 MILLION CIVILIANS  
SHELTERING IN THIS CITY RIGHT 
UP AGAINST THE EGYPTIAN BORDER. 
CONDITIONS ARE SAID TO BE VERY 
DIFFICULT. ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE 
CAN DO IS WATCH AND WAIT IN FEAR
AS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS DISCUSS,
