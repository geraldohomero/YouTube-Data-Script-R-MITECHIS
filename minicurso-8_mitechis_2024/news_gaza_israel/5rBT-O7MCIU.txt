biden has spent more than half his life
immersed in u.s politics i want to
look back now at his path to the white
house and his strongest bid
yet for the oval office
after half a century in politics joe
biden has never been closer to the top
job this is the most important election
of our lifetimes
this race marks his third attempt
running for president
it ain't over man we're just getting
started at 77 years old a victory would
make biden the oldest person ever
elected as commander in chief america
deserves a president who understands
what people are going through his
political path though
largely began when he was first elected
to the senate for delaware in 1972
at the age of 29. tragedy struck just a
month
later when his first wife and baby
daughter died in a car accident
he was sworn in at the hospital as his
two toddler sons
recovered from serious injuries biden
would be elected
six times to the senate before winning
the vice presidency in 2008.
he would serve two consecutive terms in
the white house
as barack obama's right-hand man the
best vice president
america's ever had mr joe biden
in 2015 another deep personal tragedy
for biden
the loss of his son beau to brain cancer
his other son hunter though would be the
focus of his opponents
during this race the mayor of moscow's
wife gave your son three and a half
million dollars
what did he do to deserve it that is not
true biden has consistently tried to
position himself as a ready and steady
alternative
to what he calls the chaos of the trump
administration
what is on the ballot here is the
character of this country
decency honor respect treating people
with dignity
now voters must choose between two white
house veterans
and two deeply competing visions for the
country's future
