>> A SERIOUS EVENT, WE SAW
THREE PEOPLE KILLED AND FOUR
OTHERS INJURED.
THEIR INJURIES ARE CRITICAL.
AT THE PHILIPPINES SENT OUT A
STATEMENT TODAY SAYING TWO OF
ITS NATIONALS WERE KILLED
INCLUDED IN THE THREE AND TWO
OTHERS WERE ALSO WOUNDED AS A
RESULT OF A HOUTHI ATTACK ON A
MISSILE, AND THIS IS THE FIRST
CONFIRMED CASUALTIES FROM THE
SERIES OF ATTACKS HOUTHIS HAVE
LAUNCHED IN THE RED SEA AND OF
CAUSE QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE.
THE HOUTHIS SAY THIS IS A U.S.
LINK SHIP AND THAT IS WHY THEY
CONTACTED, BUT THE OWNER HAS
SOLD ITS OWNERSHIP OF THIS
VESSEL A WEEK OR SO AGO, AND
NOW IT IS OWNED UNDER A
DIFFERENT PERSON, BUT THE
CONFUSION AND THE DIFFERENT
INFORMATION DO NOT MATTER.
WHAT MATTERS IS NO ONE IS SAFE
TRAVELING THROUGH THE RED SEA.
WE SAW ANOTHER SHIP YESTERDAY
SINKING INTO THE WATERS.
THE ORIGINAL ATTACK ON THAT
SHIP CAUSING DAMAGE, AND NOT TO
MENTION THIS SHIP THAT WAS
SEIZED AT THE ONSET OF THESE
ATTACKS. TOM:
IS THE INEVITABLE RESPONSE TO
STEP UP IN TERMS OF U.S.
AND U.K. ATTACKS ON THOSE HOUTHI
POSITIONS, MILITANTS?
>> THE U.S.
AND ALLIES RESPONSE TO THESE
ATTACKS HAVE BEEN CALIBRATED TO
A CERTAIN POINT.
IT SEEMS THAT THE U.S.
AND THOSE TRYING TO DEFEND
TRAVEL IN THE RED SEA DO NOT
WANT TO FLAREUP OR BE THE CAUSE
OF A FLAREUP IN THE REGION OR
IN YEMEN AS A WHOLE.
THE HOUTHIS HAVE BECOME THIS
WILDCARD IN THIS CONFLICT AND
THEY ARE BACKED BY IRAN, AND
OBSERVERS SAY THEY THEMSELVES
HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY THE
IMPACT THEY WERE ABLE TO CAUSE,
SO MANY POTENTIAL CAUSE OF A
FLAREUP IN THE REGION MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE EVEN MORE DAMAGING
TO SHIPPING.
THE HOUTHIS HAVE DRONES AND
SAUDI AND UAE EXITING IN
COUNTRIES BEING ATTACKED AS
WELL.
IT IS CALIBRATED, AND I THINK
IT WILL STAY THAT WAY.
