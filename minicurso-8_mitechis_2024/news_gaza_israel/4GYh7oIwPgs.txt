At noon.
Columbia University has extended its deadline for student
protesters at a tent encampment to clear out.
This comes as more protests against the Israel
Hamas war are happening on campuses nationwide.
Naomi Ruck
is here with more
student
demonstrators on Columbia University's campus facing a midnight
deadline to clear their encampment dug into their positions
overnight.
The university said some protesters did pack up and it's
extending the deadline to continue talking with student protest leaders,
campuses across the country are trying to balance
free speech with safety concerns from Jewish students.
The demonstrators are angry over Israel's month long bombardment of Gaza.
Their demands mirror a growing number of
campus protests from Massachusetts to California,
Minnesota to Texas.
Number one call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Number two
to disclose all financial investments in Zionist organizations.
Number three to divest from those organizations,
but those who study divestment say calls to financially
disentangled colleges from Israel have gone nowhere for decades.
No campus has decided to divest from investments in
Israel or companies that do business with Israel.
This is a political debate where people have strongly divergent views
in New York City
protests are taking place beyond college campuses.
Police arrested more than 200 demonstrators Tuesday night
blocking traffic near the home of Senator Chuck Schumer.
They projected the message stop arming Israel onto the Brooklyn Public Library.
The protest organized by the left wing advocacy group,
Jewish Voice for Peace took place on the second night of Passover,
