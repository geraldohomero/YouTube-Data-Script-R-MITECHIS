This is something that just shows you
how every different aspect of society
is under attack.
There was a patient that I was introduced
to on one of the first days that I was in
al-Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis,
and he was given a nickname.
His name is “Sarookh” or “Rocket.”
And I said, “Why do they call him Rocket?”
And they said it was kind of
like this sarcastic joke.
He had a donkey and he had a cart.
And anytime he heard
that there was an airstrike —
because many of the ambulances
were not able
to reach the people who had been injured
or the people who had been killed—
Rocket would jump on his donkey
and pull the cart and go find people that needed help.
And Rocket would bring those people back to al-Nasser Hospital,
where they would either get treatment
or that their families would be able
to give them a proper burial.
And so people called him Rocket
because, as slow as the donkey was,
Rocket was still always heading there
right away and coming back.
Rocket had been injured in an airstrike
in one of these journeys.
He's had to undergo multiple surgeries
and he's on the cusp.
He may make it, he may not make it.
Three or four days later,
after we showed up
at al-Nasser Hospital, he had died from his wounds.
And I remember them kind of
cleaning the room, cleaning Rocket
and sending him to the morgue.
The next day
his father comes in during visiting hours.
Nobody told him that Rocket had died.
He had no idea.
And I remember his dad totally losing it,
screaming:
“How could no one say anything?
What happened?
When did it happen? Where's my son?”
I'll never forget the sound of his voice.
I mean, his 27-, 28-year-old son gone,
and he didn't even get a chance to see him
before he had been taken to the morgue.
I mean I can't even imagine
what was going through his head.
And there's nothing you can say.
You can't explain yourself.
You can't say: “There's
no there's no service.
I can't call you.
You're also displaced.”
It didn't matter. It wasn't an excuse.
It was a father that was grieving.
I think most people, they can't understand, but most
people can realize just how horrible
that situation is, just how tragic it is.
