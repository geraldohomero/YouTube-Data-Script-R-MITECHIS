Very good and we continue talking about the
War in the Middle East and this time we go
to talk about Israel and ever leave
to gather to negotiate a fire stop
In Cairo these begin
negotiations is news
encouraging we can see huh you
negotiations that so far did not give
its fruits beyond a small
truce that had a few days ago
A few weeks but well now they resume
In Cairo negotiations to
reach a high Israel fire and
Terror Group Never take a step
ahead of both parties have decided
resume negotiations to try
get an agreement although the first
Israeli Minister Benjam√≠n Netanyahu
stressed his intention to continue with his
Rafa offensive what already lifted clear
Somehow reactions in Israel no
This is the meeting will take place in the
Cairo capital of Egypt place to which
will go to an Israeli delegation and
This way the United States and
Egypt continue their work to
try to end the war that
began on October 7 and
conversations resume like this after
that last Friday Israel
decided to withdraw your group from
Negotiators after a crossing
accusations between both parties after the
Resolution of the Security Council of
the UN in which a
resolution to demand a high
fire the terrorist group said that
He beat the group the group described
as a high fire
exhaustive in which the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza
return of displaced and also the
Liberation of Palestinian prisoners in return
of the kidnapped reen in the
perpetrated attacks at the beginning of the
Conflict in Israel remember yes and
Let us also remember that Israel dismissed
The proposal presented on March 14
before what from the cabinet of
Netanyahu were considered as
unrealistic claims and demands
delusions is what they qualified and
Given this situation he never accused
Netanyahu to undermine efforts
diplomats and obstruct the possibility
of a good agreement in this context is
that they become now in Cairo to
negotiations to see if it is achieved
Finally a high

fire
