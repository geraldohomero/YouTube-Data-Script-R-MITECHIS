The situation here is very dangerous
Rais
C a few seconds of video exchange
inaudible is all that Mahmoud
obtains after more than 20 attempts
calling for his injured cousin Sami
currently in the Nasr hospital in
Gaza after being evacuated from the hospital
of Shifa taken by the Israeli army
It is ultimately a text message and
vocal that ends up getting news
information it cuts its vile its
cut you saw that again
hung up for children it is
very very very very
Difficult every day I think of my
family I can't sleep in
thinking of that when we call it does not
does not work the only info that we have
We see them on television with each
instant we learn that a cousin that a
aunt that an uncle died all
days it's the same thing
Since October 7, Mahmoud has
already lost 13 members around him
in addition to this situation the man must
face many issues
Here in Jordan not the right to vote
work in administration or even
to have a business to drive your
own car He has this blue license
different from that of the Jordanians
mentioning its origin Gazaoui and him
prohibiting any other
vehicle that his own if Jordan
gave nationality obviously that we
would be in better conditions this
that it should above all be that one day
We can go home in Palestine
Because whatever happens we will stay
always refugees here in Jordan if
Gazaouis are real citizens
second zone the Agemital Kingdom has in
revenge granted citizenship to
Palestinians from other cities than Gaza
Hassen is one of them
high school teacher at the Baga camp
beats for years to do
recognize citizenship by
Palestinians from Gaza was born
in Jordan as
Mahmoud a difference between us but
We are all Palestinians in
The same situation we were
moved we are here now we
what we ask for authorities
Jordanian is that the Gazaouis and
Palestinians from other cities all
born in Jordan can enjoy the same
rights and therefore obtain nationality
Jordanian as Mahmou in total 350000
Palestinians lived at the Bag camp in
Jordan among them at least 10,000
people were from
Gaza enclave
