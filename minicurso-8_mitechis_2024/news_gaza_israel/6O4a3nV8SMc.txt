we're looking at what is going to be
done
with some of the vaccines that we are
not
using we have to make sure they are
safe to be sent and we hope to be able
to be of some
help and value to uh countries uh around
the world we've
talked to our neighbors a matter of fact
uh a fellow who's working really hard
to take care of his country and deal
with this i was on the phone with for
about half an hour today and the prime
minister of canada
we helped a little bit there we're going
to try to help some more but there's
other countries as well that i'm
confident we can help including
in central america and uh so
but it's it's in process we don't have
enough to be confident to give senate
abroad now
but i i expect we're going to be able to
do that thank you
all right so there you have it let's
bring in michelle boyer who's standing
by
in ottawa so originally the americans
sent up 1.5 million doses of astrazeneca
vaccine that has not been approved for
use in the u.s so they're not using it
sitting in their freezers now you're
getting a sense if you read between the
lines that another
batch of doses could be sent north from
the united states
right we knew that these conversations
were ongoing between
the prime minister's office procurement
minister's office uh their counterparts
south of the border as well but
obviously
this is going to the two top offices
in each respective countries as canada
and the united states continue to
negotiate
to get more vaccines shipped north
again 1.5 loan 1.5 million loan to
canada
of astrazeneca because it hasn't been
approved there it has been approved here
and we're in pretty dire straits right
now to get the rollout
uh up to full speed because ontario in
lockdown as well
per capita infection rates through the
roof in
alberta
