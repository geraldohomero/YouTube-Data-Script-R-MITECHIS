ismail obeida has five children
and he is about to lose his home
ismail lives in a palestinian
neighborhood called surbaher
it's in occupied east jerusalem
and israeli authorities want to demolish
their house due to its proximity to a
security barrier
if the house is destroyed we won't have
the home and we have to live in the
streets with my sons
the demolition of the stones
is less bad than the demolition of a
human being israel built the barrier in
2005.
in 2011 israel created a buffer zone on
both sides of the barrier and prohibited
any construction
israel now plans to demolish 10 homes
because they are either too close to the
barrier or were built without permits
recognized by the israelis
we are inside the buffer zone where
there are more than 200 buildings and
this barrier 15 years ago the
international court of justice ruled
that this barrier violates israelis
obligation under international law
but israel disagrees and says these
houses must be demolished for security
reasons
tiarte world asked the israeli army for
an interview but the military declined
sharon nawaz is an activist with an
israeli ngo
yeshteen i believe the majority of the
buildings are located in area a and then
there's i i believe it's two of the
buildings are in area b
um and all of them receive permits to
build from the palestinian authorities
so it's clearly a violation of the
palestinian authorities um that their
sovereignty their authority in that area
but it's a clear
situation in which israel is
essentially showing that they're in
control of the entire west bank israel
has ordered ismail and other
palestinians in the area to destroy
their homes or it will be done for them
and they will be presented with the bill
but ismail veda says he will not destroy
what is on hands built
fatiho's true world occupied east
jerusalem
