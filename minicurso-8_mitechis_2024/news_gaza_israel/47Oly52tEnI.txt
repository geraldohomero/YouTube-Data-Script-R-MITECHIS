there are obviously no signs of any
de-escalation overnight
gaza continued to experience some heavy
bombardment from the israeli
war planes as well as the artillery in
khan yunus
in rafah in the south in the north in
bethlehem and in jabalia
were by the way a complete block a
complete neighborhood had to evacuate in
asuhada area
because israel continued to target the
infrastructure they
completely destroyed the streets over
there as well as
a software area that's north of gaza
city itself
several injuries had been reported in
their place in hanunis a family in a
resident house
survived by a miracle let me say when an
israeli missile fell in their home
no injuries had been reported simply
because the missile did not explode
in a sabra east of gaza city a civilian
house was targeted with more than one
missile
one woman had been killed was killed in
the attack while four children
uh were injured so i can tell you also
that the artillery here as you can hear
right behind me uh continues to show the
eastern side of the gaza
enclave as we speak however
locally speaking i can also mention that
the palestinian factions continue to
retaliate
the attacks on civilians by launching
the rages of rockets every once and
everyone every couple of hours
and today early this morning al-qasam
brigade
the armed wing of hamas targeted a bus
carrying israeli soldiers
near the ziki military base with a
guided
missile based on the what we are hearing
from the israeli media
no injuries had been reported but it's
still very soon to tell i can also say
that
the death toll here in gaza will
continue to rise obviously if the
situation continues to escalate but
health officials
are so busy dealing with injuries
dealing
with the crisis in humanitarian side
that they cannot update the list every
hour or two
sometimes it takes them more than four
or five hours to update the list
of injuries and deaths but obviously it
had
it has increased
