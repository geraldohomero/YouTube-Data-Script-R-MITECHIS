Avilar that is also with us
Marta Ehran does not get into the war and
He has just sent a clear message to ever
I don't get because nobody told me about
that
Eh of course you will attack Israel and nobody
He told me anything you will put me in a
Conflict so now I'm not going to enter
In Israel War I will forgiveness is
making its position clear for the first
time for a long time and be careful because
See what is the continuity solution
For Gaza right now Marta
It is indeed something that is
Publishing José Reuters right now
They say it was at the beginning of November
When Iran's supreme leader had
sent a clear message precisely to
Head of ever when they had gathered
In Tehran huh according to three officials to
Those who have consulted Reuters
Basically what I will never said
It is not notified of the 7 of the 7 of
October against Israel and therefore not
We are going to enter the war on your
Name of course attention call
very clear by Iran to ever
What Reuters is also counting is also
that Ayatolá Ali Jamenei told Ismail
Jan Jille forgiveness that an old man will go
supporter you already know about ever will continue
providing your support for good support
political and moral to the group but does not go
to intervene directly according to
several Iranian officials and also
They never have knowledge about this
matter what is commented on what he says
Reuters is that the supreme leader pressed
To Jill to also silence the
voices in the Palestinian group in Hamas that
They publicly asked that Iran and their ally
In this case, his ally Leban is Hezbollah
They joined the battle against Israel
With all its force therefore this
implies that they will effectively go for
The least according to Iranian sources was not
aware of the attack of the 7 of
October to Israel and who do not want to enter
In war I don't know if they were aware or
no but of course what they are doing is
Not sharing it effectively
will fight the battles you decide to choose
And from there that information comes
