now it's been 16 days since the Israel
Hamas War started tensions are
escalating on the battlefield there are
fears of multif front War for Israel and
the threat of an ongr invasion for Gaza
let's tell
you take you to the site where it all
started on the morning of 7th of October
residents in southern Israel woke up to
their worst nightmare Israel was under
attack one of the very first places to
Bear the onslaught was h of Hamas was
kibuts beri not sparing women children
and the elderly the militants went on a
killing spree here they took dozens of
hostages back to Gaza killing hundreds
at will they left the place in Ruins
here's a report from our correspondent
Vishal Pand from B in
Israel more than 100 people were killed
and many kidnapped from this Kut very
because this was the place where Hamas
infiltrated first and they were killing
everyone and I came to
report my mom she was kidnapped by Hamas
I have movie that
uh someone sent me from a telegram group
Gaza now and she was kidnapped with her
husband and two Neighbors from kibuts
B and I
guess they're in Hamas now in in
Gaza and that's
it look at these bullet holes of the car
and I want to say something s it's not a
war it's not a battlefield you see the
babies the mother the fathers in their
bedrooms in the protection rooms and how
the terrorist kill them it's not a war
it's not a butfield it's a massacre it's
a terror act
activity Hamas killed those people who
were trying to escape through this car
it's
unbearable I have so many funerals to be
in and you know I I can't even be in in
all the funerals you you can see
everywhere is
Graves
and everywhere is everyone is
dead
monsters even small children were not
spared by the
