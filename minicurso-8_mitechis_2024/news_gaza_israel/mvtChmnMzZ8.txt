Nahuel we get back into what
It happens in the Middle East Images
dramatic of a terrible rescue
really terrible because they could
rescue two people that is the part
Positive this happened in southern Gaza
where they bombed a residential area
Among many other properties
several houses were destroyed and underneath
of the rubble was a very
young man who was lucky
really rescued is like
Eh a small sample not to
Everything that happens in relation to
Rescue teams medical assistance
because they have nothing they have no
Hospitals operating do not have
medications do not even have the
infrastructure to circulate
The ambulances for example then is
a permanent effort for
survival neither more nor less this
It happened yesterday in southern Gaza Claro
In addition the work carried out by the
Red Cross collaborators
Red Cross volunteers
Red Crescent International EH
It is truly very risky because
They are permanently in the area already
We know that in Gaza there is no area
safe and they are permanently
disposition of situations like this yes
And this news is to say it is positive if
wants because they rescued them alive
But they are permanently
corpses find people who are so
wound that no matter how
Medical Care Center no longer can
survive then is to deal with
With frustration and frustration
horrible not in terms of human now
which are scenes that we see every day
And we also present them here
On our screen if you think
We take this moment to review
Some data yesterday for example is
registered a fact that since 2006 does not
It took place in gauze and they threw
From airplanes a series of supplies
In the south also for the army
Israeli who is based
land and this did not pass since the year
2006 when it was the second
confrontation between Israel and
This never happened yesterday and
They launched from the air through with
Parachute in good boxes supplies
military huh medical issues too
so that the terrestrial army continues
advancing and thus ends up forging a
Attack that is terrestrial and sea aerial
That is to say it is in its most stage
Fierce Israel's attack yes clearly
It is what you say is moving for
All and every time it takes possession
More of the Gaza Strip
