The method they used to kill my son
It was burn it alive, literally.
Hello.
Welcome.
[Hussein Abu Khdeir
Mohammed Abu Khdeir's father]
Two weeks have passed since your son's death.
As you take?
I am very bad.
I am not well psychologically.
I get worse day by day.
Every time I think of my son
Everything makes me harder.
How is the rest of your family?
My wife and children cry every night.
My children are afraid to go outside and burn them.
They say, "I'm afraid."
"The Jews will come for me
And they will burn me. "
"They will kidnap me and set me on fire."
Your house is in the place where clashes are taking place
between the young Palestinians and the Israeli police.
How about?
The clashes that are taking place
They are the result of the actions of the Zionist government.
The Israeli government.
The population is pissed off because they murdered and set fire to my son.
The method they used to kill my son
It was burn it alive.That is something that had not happened before in the world.
Except in Israel.
They have become neo-nazis,
Leaving the Germans behind.
Namely who will turn on fire tomorrow.
Because they have the support of the government.
I don't want revenge,
But if God wants, God will avenge them.
Of all those who participated in the murder of my son.
God will have His revenge.
What messages do you have for the Palestinian people and the Israeli people?
The Palestinians would tell them to hold on to their land.
We have been Israel for longer
In this earth.
The Israelis would tell them that they must give up terror,
and give up the Zionist government,
since it is a extreme right government.
We have no problem making peace with the Israelis.
But the government wants both: peace and earth.
How can that be possible?
It is impossible to have both
Peace and Earth.
They have to choose: peace or land.
