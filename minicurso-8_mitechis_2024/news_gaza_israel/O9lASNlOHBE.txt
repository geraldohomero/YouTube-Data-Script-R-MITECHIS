RACHEL: THE SHA A LVA CENTER IN
JERUSALEM OFFERS CARE TO -- NOW
THE IDF HAS DESIGNATED IT A
NATIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE
CENTER.
JOINING US NOW, GABEY HERSH.
THIS IS A WORLD RENOWNED CENTER
FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES.
TELL US HOW THAT MISSION HAS
CHANGED IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S A
HAPPEN HAPPENED IN ISRAEL OVER
THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS.
>> SO ON A TYPICAL DAY, WE WOULD
HAVE MYRRH BETWEEN REALLY UP TO
THE ABOUT 1,000 CHILDREN,
BABIES, CHILDREN AND CULTS ALL
COMING TO OUR -- ADULTS ALL
COMING TO OUR CENTER FROM ACROSS
ISRAEL'S DEMOGRAPHIC, COMING
FROM PROGRAMS THAT SEE ALL THE
WAY THROUGH BIRTH TO ADULTHOOD.
AS SOON AS WE HAD THE OUTBREAK
OF WAR, WE OPENED OUR DOORS.
AS YOU MENTIONED, WE'RE A
DESIGNATED NATIONAL CRISIS
RESPONSE CENTER, AND IMMEDIATELY
STARTED TO BRING IN PEOPLE WHO'D
BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE SOUTHERN
BORDER.
SO ALREADY THE DAY AFTER THE
OUTBREAK OF WAR WE HAD HUNDREDS
OF FAMILIES WHO HAD COME TO STAY
IN THE NEIGHBORING HOTEL.
WE OPENED OUR DOORS TO THE
CENTER, AND THEY'VE BEEN USING
OUR CENTER ALL DAY, EVERY DAY
FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILIES COMING.
WE SET UP A TEMPORARY SCHOOL
HERE FOR THEM.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE A
GROUP OF TEENAGE YOUTH AT RISK
WHO, AGAIN, THEIR CENTER WAS IN
ONE OF THOSE NEIGHBORING
VILLAGES.
THEIR CENTER IS NOW ACTUALLY
WITHIN A MILITARY ZONE, IS AND
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GO BACK FOR
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
SO A HUNDRED TEENAGE YOUTH ARE
HERE, THIS IS NOW EFFECTIVELY
THEIR HOME.
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ON SCREEN
NOW, THERAPY SESSIONS WE'VE
OPENED BOTH FOR THE CHILDREN
AND, OF COURSE, THEIR PARENTS,
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN EVACUATED.
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE HAVE
EVACUATED, POTENTIALLY NOW ALSO
PROSECUTE IF NORTHERN BORDERS,
WE ARE NOW GETTING READY TO TAKE
THE A THOUSAND ADDITIONAL
EVACUEES.
RACHEL: WOW.
GABY, IT'S AN AMAZING CENTER.
WE KNOW DISRUPTION OF SERVICES
IS ESPECIALLY HARD FOR CHILDREN
WITH DISABILITIES.
WE THANK YOU F
