WHICH HILARY CLINTON RESPONDED
IT IS NOT FREE-SPEECH WHEN
YOU'RE DISRUPTING EVERYBODY ELSE
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.
STUART: THANK YOU, ANOTHER LOOK
AT THE HEADLINE WRITTEN BY BRET
STEPHENS, NEW YORK TIMES
COLUMNIST, THE PALESTINIAN
REPUBLIC OF FEAR AND
MISINFORMATION HE'S TALKING
ABOUT GAZA AND ABOUT HAMAS.
A PALESTINIAN PEACE ACTIVISTS
AND HE JOINS ME NOW.
STEPHEN SAYS YOU CANNOT BELIEVE
ANYTHING THAT HAMAS SAYS, THAT
IS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, DO YOU
AGREE WITH THAT.
>> THAT'S NOT REALLY A SECRET, I
THINK EVERYBODY AROUND THE WORLD
KNOWS THAT VERY WELL AND I THINK
HAMAS IN THE PALESTINIAN
GOVERNMENT IN THE GAZA STRIP
UNDER CONTROL AND HAMAS IS THE
ONE THAT IS ORDERING WHAT TO
PUBLISH AND WHAT NOT TO PUBLISH
WHICH MEANS THE OLDER
PALESTINIAN JOURNALIST IN GAZA
ARE UNDER A SELF-CENSORSHIP.
STUART: YOU ARE A PALESTINIAN
PEACE ACTIVISTS, I BELIEVE YOU
WANT TO CRUSH HAMAS CAN YOU TELL
US HOW WE WOULD DO THAT.
>> I REALLY HOPE AND I BELIEVE
MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN GAZA ARE
ALSO HOPING SO.
I THINK WITH THE MILITARY
EQUIPMENT TODAY I BELIEVE THAT
ONE DAY I HOPE WE WILL WAKE UP
AND HAMAS WILL NEVER BE ON THE
MAP.
STUART: HAS TO BE DONE BY A
GROUND INVASION, CORRECT?
>> I'M NOT QUITE SURE IT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN BUT IN THE MEANTIME
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO CALL THE
PEOPLE TO MOVE FROM ONE SIDE TO
THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE IF THERE
IS A GROUND INVASION TO THE
NORTH AT LEAST THE NORTH RIGHT
NOW IS EMPTY FROM HUMAN BEINGS.
STUART: ISRAEL WOULD LOSE THE
PUBLIC RELATIONS WAR BY SHIFTING
A MILLION OR 2 MILLION PEOPLE
OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND
DEVASTATED THE AREA, THEY WOULD
LOSE THE PUBLIC RELATIONS WAR,
WOULD THEY NOT?
>> I THINK THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS
HAMAS ITSELF RATHER THAN ANYBODY
ELSE.
I THINK THE MASSACRE THAT THE
HAMAS COMMUNITY IN ISRAEL WILL
NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.
I BELIEVE THAT HAMAS IN THE PAST
16 YEARS THERE USING 2 MILLION
PEOPLE AS HOSTAGES AND WHAT
HAMAS PROVIDED TO THE PEOPLE IN
THE PAST 16 YEARS IS ONLY MISERY
AND DESTRUCTION.
STUART: HOW MANY OTHER
PALESTINIANS FEEL THE SAME WAY
AS YOU.
>> MOST OF THE PALESTINIANS FEEL
THE SAME BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE
FIRST QUESTION WE STARTED WITH
THE EVERYBODY IS SCARED FROM
SPEAKING LOUD TO EXPRESS ABOUT
THE SITUATION.
STUART: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
EXPRESSING YOUR OPINION ON T
