Iran's supreme leader Ayah Ali hailing
the planners of the brutal October 7
Hamas attack on
Israel
an assault that killed at least, 1400
Israelis denied Iran's involvement in
the attack his statement set the ball
rolling for the top tan officials to
openly register their angst against
Israel in the face of a brutal
retaliatory air strikes Campaign which
has killed thousands of civilians in
Gaza
in the immediate aftermath of the Ali
Hospital bombing in
Gaza Iranian president ibraim RI called
on Muslim countries to sever ties with
Israel few days ago Iran's foreign
minister Hussein Amir Abdullah hyan said
that a preemptive action is expected
anytime adding that Israel will not be
allowed to take any action in the Gaza
Strip without facing
consequences interestingly officials
from Iran and hisbah an Iran back
militia based in Lebanon helped plan the
Hamas attack according to
reports however the US and its allies
have not found evidence directly linking
tan it is no secret that Iran supplies
weapons and money to Hamas isah is
reported to have provided training to
Hamas
Fighters according to reports Iran is
moving some members of its Elite Islamic
revolutionary guard Corps toward the
Israeli borders sparking concerns of a
new front
opening so what does this rhetoric from
Iran
mean Iran is under pressure owing to
several factors such as massive anti-h
hijab protests last year and economic
sanctions from us and its
allies the rhetoric from Iran leaders on
the Palestinian cause could be aimed at
regaining Regional
credentials it can be recalled that tan
has already restored ties with regional
Behemoth Saudi
Arabia with US President Joe Biden's
meeting with Arab leaders
cancelled in protest at the ongoing
Israeli military campaign against
Gaza tan could have an opportunity to
exert its dominance in the Middle
East
people in Iran have already started
hitting the streets rallying behind
their leaders and shouting anti-israeli
slogans
with global Powers Russia and China on
the same page in condemning Israel Iran
could play a crucial role in the Israel
Gaza conflict with Vishal VI usam sha
