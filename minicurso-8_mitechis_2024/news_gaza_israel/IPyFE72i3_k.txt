We continue in conflict of interest and
These images that obviously to all
They put gallina's skin that everyone
And all excites us a lot because
The third flight arrived the third plane
with
229 Argentines and Argentines who were
Repatriated and repatriated from Israel
In full war with ever
motion of those who were
repatriated and their families that
obviously there they were waiting for them with
open arms to give them the so
A kind hug we were arriving
of these 229 compatriots and if
We seem shared it moments ago
The third came
plane with a new contingent of
repatriated Argentines and this told
return home yes the first feeling of
Reconcentrate with your family the truth
A moment as a total flash
shocking after everything lived
Be here and meet my family
The truth as you can't believe what you
He had to live there eh I is in an area
Central Tel VIIVE Luckily no
I wore so much but sirens all day and
The truth is a situation that I never saw
In my life I hope not to live again
a lot of emotion a mixture of
sensations of emotional in this
Eh eh the happiness that your child
arrive and on the other
side the anguish of what is happening
out when you found the theme of the
War the first attack never what you
happened and the first thing I thought
It was and then everything that entails
The
very emotional anguish
And sad that is in this way the
back to see him that he was desperate
to see it but very sad that it is of
This way what happened to you when
You found that it was going to be repatriated
Finally, I was not going home
two weeks so imagine that a
Tremendous emotion not now is calm
calm is our
day what emotion
no but I get proud to think that
This Argentina who received so many
Immigrants d its history is Argentina
who knows how to open your arms to all
Human beings who live in this earth
This Argentina that really has us
that proudly beyond
problems we have is true we have
problems and we will solve them
Because we are Argentines and we are capable
But I also want to highlight our
virtues that are fundamentally those
having opened your arms to all
Earth beings so that they come
They want to live in many many
thank you
