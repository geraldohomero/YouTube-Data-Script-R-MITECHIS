same situation therefore critical humanitarian
even catastrophic we can say to
Gaza and the health situation concern
especially yes then the situation
health is indeed extremely
concern good we will see what that
gives with the introduction in principle of
These famous tactical break that Israel has
ultimately undoubtedly accepted under
high pressure from the United States which
wanted there to be at least this break
The United States agrees with Israel
so that there is no to stop the fire
Uh in any case not to stop the fire
Before all the hostages are released
by Hamas that Hamas obviously
refuse there would also be discussions
in Doa on a humanitarian truce it is
still different from a break and a
stop fire a humanitarian truce of 3
days with the key the release of
some hostages immediately the only
concrete thing that we normally see
and still not really it yet
concrete there was this authorized corridor
by the Israeli army and Avan-Tiier
which allowed a few thousand of
civilian to descend south uh
Now we will see how to function
These poses if the bombardments stop
really and then it should also be noted
that the Israel army simply spoke of
posuse in certain northern areas therefore
We understand that people will be able to
Leave these zones from north to south
We don't really answer the fact
to know that the way is
secure over the entire duration of the journey
even in the south so that's also
A question, the fact remains that
after more than a month of just over a
month of a bombing and and
destruction so that's the struggle
against Hamas with these hundreds
and these thousands of civilians killed or
injured in Gaza Israel finally accepted
anyway the idea of a break which was
very strongly debated within the
War cabinet uh some some
being on a fairly hard line saying
Not even a tactical break of 4 HE
It is war must be eradicated the
Hamas Hamas is Imriquet with the
civilian population uh that's that that
is part of the war visibly
Benjamin Netaniaahou therefore accepted the
Strong recommendations of
United States but we feel that Israel in
The immediate will not go further thank you
Many Bruno for this lighting
