three generations of the sardic family
have lived in this small damp apartment
ever since they fled their hometown of
sasa near the israeli-lebanon border in
the 1948 war with
israel i've spent 72 years in the camps
in lebanon humiliated oppressed
displaced persecuted and deprived
the camp just four kilometers south of
beirut has expanded to become a mini
city ever since it was established back
in the nineteen fifties
here in bourge camp around twenty
thousand palestinian refugees have been
living in a state of political limbo
ever since they fled their ancestral
homeland many see trump's peace plan as
another betrayal in their cause
the proposal would see israel annexing
vast swathes of the west bank including
sardec's hometown and most of jerusalem
something palestinians say is
unimaginable
they agreed to sell the land and they
don't have the right because it is our
land the new generation understand more
and more
but america and israel want from
palestine and arab ward if i die he must
die with me this is
justice
hamas and the plo which have been at
loggerheads since the party took control
of the gaza strip in 2007
have both condemned the u.s plan
palestinian people are united against
the deal in palestine in gaza in the
west bank in the 48 lands and in the
diaspora and here in the lebanese camps
although there are few options for
palestinians who oppose the plan
and both major political leaders in
israel are signing on to it
the sardek family is undeterred
if we are united in our spirit we will
become stronger than the warplanes the
tanks and the weapons of the israeli
enemy because of our spirit we will win
we will win god willing
i am proud of my grandfather i want to
tell trump one word
palestine is for
for us
it's this deeply rooted desire to return
home that's uniting not just political
factions but also generations against
donald trump's proposal
owen holdaway borge camp
lebanon
