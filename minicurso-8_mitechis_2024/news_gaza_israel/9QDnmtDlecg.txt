 
 HUSBAND.
 IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, THE 
 ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES 
 SPOKESPERSON, GOOD TO HAVE YOU,
 I AM SURE YOU HEAR MANY STORIES
 LIKE THAT, ISRAELI RESIDENTS 
 THEMSELVES OR THOSE VISITING 
 WHO ARE EAGER TO GET OUT OF 
 HARM'S WAY.
 WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM?
 >> WE ARE IN A MASSIVE MOMENT, 
 HUNDREDS OF TERRORISTS 
 STREAMING ACROSS THE BORDER, 
 KILLING WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND 
 ELDERLY, YOU SEE THOSE HORRIFIC
 STORIES, CONTINUING WITH 
 THOUSANDS OF ROCKET FIRE IN 
 POPULATION CENTERS, WE ARE 
 ACTING DECISIVELY AGAINST THAT.
 THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS TO STOP
 THE ATTACKS ON THE CIVILIAN 
 POPULATION AND MAKE SURE HAMAS 
 CANNOT RENEW THOSE ATTACKS FROM
 LAND, SEA, OR AIR.
 NEIL: YOU PROBABLY HEARD THE 
 WARNING FROM HAMAS TO SAY THAT 
 IF YOU HARM THEM OR ATTACK 
 PALESTINIAN POSITIONS THEY WILL
 KILL HOSTAGES.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 >> HAMAS'S WAR IS A WAR AND 
 CIVILIANS, STARTED WITH A 
 MASSACRE OF CIVILIANS, HUNDREDS
 OF ISRAELIS KILLED, THEY'VE 
 TAKEN CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS 
 HOSTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME 
 COMING TO ISRAEL, PUT THEIR 
 KIDS IN GAZA IN FRONT OF 
 MILITARY TARGETS, IN THEIR 
 MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO
 EVADE ATTACKS.
 IT'S NOTHING SURPRISING.
 IT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN 
 FIGHTING AGAINST FOR YEARS AND 
 WE WILL MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T 
 HAPPEN AGAIN.
 NEIL: I KNOW YOU ARE FOCUSED ON
 THE WAR AS YOU SHOULD BE, BUT 
 DOES IT TROUBLE YOU THAT THIS 
 HAS NOT BEEN EXACTLY CONDEMNED 
 IT FROM THE ARAB WORLD.
 HAMAS HASN'T BEEN CONDEMNED.
 MAYBE IT'S A WAY OF LAYING LOW 
 AND NOT TRYING TO AGGRAVATE 
 TENSIONS BUT DOES THIS CONCERN 
 YOU?
 >> WE ENJOYED INCREDIBLE 
 SUPPORT FROM OUR ALLIES AROUND 
 THE WORLD PARTICULARLY THE US, 
 THE US MILITARY SAID THEIR 
 WORDS OF SUPPORT AND BACKING IT
 UP WITH DATES, SO THAT HELPS 
 US.
 THE US IS PROVIDING US WITH 
 MILITARY ASSISTANCE.
 THANKFULLY AND R
