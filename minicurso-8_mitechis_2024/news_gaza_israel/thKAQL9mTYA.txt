Why are we saying that not the box
Will go and change the map for Hamas
Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing and
Let us explain to you only through the map
Actually how this whole controversy progresses closer
This has a history of more than 75 years
Palestinian land and Jewish land of dispute
Some of this method was a picture in 1947
Time when India also fights for its freedom struggle
Was and when India independent on 15 August 1947
If there is a picture of this way Palestine
Was it but the Jewish settlements were here
The one you are seeing in red patches
This method was in this way, but after that when partition
Planned within 1948 and some in it
A picture of this method was seen by Israel
The area was this red area you are watching
It was Israeli i.e. Jewish region and
Palestinian land was in this method and you
See this is the area of Gaza Strip
This Palestinian land is at that time
From the people of Palestine had the settlement and
The same area that we today of West Bank
Know by name but Palestinian land
And the picture of Israeli land which is 1900 49
Something from 1987 in this way
Changed i.e. you see the 1967 war of 1973
War and Oslo Accord was done then
Without 1987 with Yasir Arafat
Oslo Accords and something inside it
Hamas came out
Whose occupation inside the area of Gaza Strip
It is that of this 1987 Oslo Accord
Protests and that is why here
The grip of the penetration of Hamas
More and it is the area of the West Bank
Something that is a picture of this method at the moment
Getting to be seen but the question arises
Is it going to change the picture
Because this area of West Bank is
Israel is also being reduced to his
After this, especially inside many areas
West Bank area is where Jerusalem
There is Eastern Jerusalem inside this area and
He also inside the West Bank area
The settlement has been taken inside but 2005 and
Israel from Gaza Strip in between 2007
All the citizens of the area were from the area
Was taken out and since then this
Conflict is going on inside the entire area
Is news
