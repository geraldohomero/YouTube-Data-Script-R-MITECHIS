And we immediately go to Hashkelon
Hhkelon who is one of the cities
Israeli infiltrated by
Hamas fighters on Saturday Claire
Duamel You are on site for France
24 Hello to you we saw it
counteroffensive continues uh on the
Gaza strip it intensifies
even hello yes the most
important is the one that comes from
Ministry of Defense Israel begins a
Complete headquarters of the Gaza Plus strip
more electricity more than
food 2.3 million civilians from
people live in this enclave under
blockade
Isra√©loegyptian here from Hashkelon we
almost continues the noise
deaf bombing against Gaza and
Then there are also rocket fire
who have targeted the
Israeli localities there have been about
120 rockets against Hashdod and Hhkelon
A very large majority of them were
intercepted by the iron dome
The question also is that of a
invasion re imminent we know that
tank columns come together to the north
Gaza's border
The Israeli army says they master all
Israeli localities around
but that infiltrates remain that
the army continues to track of course the
situation evolves very very
quickly clear the Hamas which would hold by
elsewhere without hostage of civilians of
soldiers that's the priority of
Israelis we
Imagine yes recently has an announcement of
The armed branch of Hamas who would say that
Four Israeli hostages were killed
with their captors during a
operation during a bombardment
Israeli it's hard to confirm
this information from with many
sources since there is less and less
information that reaches us from
The Gaza Strip one of the consequences
Of course this total seat which begins
but also a great control of Hamas
On all the information that comes out
of Gaza Israel also enormously controls
The Israeli army is enormously controlled
very precise information on this
which takes place at the forehead since it is this
are of course very
currently sensitive what we know
is that the strikes they continue
There were a few thousand displaced
Within the Gaza Strip 123000
moved according to the latest figures
The UN to other locations
considered more secure but at
True in the Gaza Strip no
place is completely secure there
has no possibility for the Gazaoui to
F since the enclave is under blockade
For 17 years thank you very much for these
Clear elements of the Hamel
