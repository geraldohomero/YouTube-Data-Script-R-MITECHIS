Our special envoy to Pauline Zer
Godar which is therefore very close to the
Gaza strip there are still any shots
From the Gaza Strip on the
Israeli territory Pauline
situation actually is very
Yes the situation is extremely tense
I don't know if you hear several
Tops we hear these booms behind
We these rockets which have been drawn since
The Gaza Strip and also these
Israeli strikes throughout the
day we could see a
intensification of cereed in particular
on the Israeli side then earlier
When we arrived in Sderot we have
could see a building cap had been
damaged there was still smoke
that came out of this building which has us
particularly struck it is when we
returned to this derope we have in
This derotte we could see a city
ghost we met in everything and for everything
two inhabitants most people have
leai the city where he is in the house
them in fear precisely of the applicants
Launched from the Gaza Strip then
When we wanted to get out of the city by
The southern exit we found ourselves facing
soldiers who explained us
that we had to stay here since a
military operation was underway at
within the city of Sderot then
was it an infiltrated undoubtedly
But for the moment the army does not confirm
Not we obviously tried to
cross -check your information but there for
The moment the army does not prefer
express themselves with regard to what
happened earlier inside
to zer what is certain is that some
thing happened but what exactly
As I tell you difficult to have
precise information in this genre
of situation I told you so we have
could also see and well these shots of
aspect from the Gaza strip since
We are within 1 km we heard
also rifle shots we have
explained that perhaps apparently a
person wanted to infiltrate
airs like that was the case on Saturday that
This person would have been abanded I put
Of course always that in the conditional I
can also tell you that the city
of Achkellon which is a few
kilometers a few kilometers from here to
several times was also targeted by
Roquettes then you should know that
The Iron DÃ´ works here of course to
about 90 % that's why sometimes
Requets sometimes arrive at
falling on Israel and that's why
also that we can see on time
current that at least 12 people have
been injured in Hkellon according to the services
hospital for this point since
