The first convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian
aid crossed into Gaza Saturday from the Egyptian
border.
It comes after 12 days of total siege of the
strip since the October 7 attack on southern
Israel by Hamas militants, which killed 1400
Israelis.
But for many who have been displaced in the
growing conflicts, 20 trucks are simply not
enough for the enclave's 2.3 million people.
“Where is your humanity, we need to know
what is being done,” says this man, who
is calling on Arab countries to send help.
Before the outbreak of war, an average of
about 450 aid trucks were arriving daily in
Gaza.
Since the October 7 attack by Hamas militants,
Israel has hammered Gaza with airstrikes.
Here in a crowded school in Gaza’s south,
Tahreer Tabash and her children are among
hundreds of other families taking shelter
from Israeli bombardment.
She says that if her children hear so much
as a chair being moved, they jump in fear.
"Our children suffer a lot at night.
They cry all night, they pee themselves without
meaning to, and I don't have time to clean
up after them, one after the other.
The place is full, I can't take care of my
children, clean for them, I can't.
There is not even 1 percent of a good, healthy,
and safe life for a child.
There is no safety.
If we don't die from war, we will die from
epidemics and diseases."
More than 4,000 Palestinians have been killed,
including hundreds of children, and 13,000
wounded in Gaza, according to the Palestinian
health ministry.
The United Nations says more than a million
have been made homeless.
There are no safe bomb shelters in Gaza, where
over 50% of Palestinians live in poverty.
In Egypt, Arab leaders condemned the siege
of Gaza at a summit convened hastily to find
a peace settlement.
But the absence of Israel and senior U.S.
officials at the meeting undermined any prospect
for halting the escalating war.
