WAS TALKING ABOUT BODIES AT
THIS DESERT, HUNDREDS OF BODIES
AT THIS DESERT RIGHT.
WHEN CONGRESS IS BACK IN
SESSION NEXT WEEK, ASSUMING A
LEADERS EVENTUALLY ELECTED,
WHAT CAN CONGRESS DO?
>> WELL, THERE'S A LOT CONGRESS
CAN DO TO SUPPORT ISRAEL,
THERE'S A LOT CONGRESS HAS DONE
TO SUPPORT ISRAEL.
BUT WE'RE PRETTY MUCH PARALYZED
RIGHT NOW BY NOT HAVING A
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED IN
AMERICAN HISTORY, OF COURSE, TO
NOT HAVE A SPEAKER LIKE THIS.
WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT
THE REPUBLICANS CAN GET THEIR
ACT TOGETHER AND EVEN PRODUCE A
NOMINEE FOR A VOTE THIS WEEK.
IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE A
FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT HERE AT
HOME TO DEAL AND RESPOND TO
THESE INTERNATIONAL CRISES.
>> WHAT SORT OF SUPPORT ARE WE
ABLE TO GIVE GIVEN THAT WE ARE
CURRENTLY IN AN ONGOING,
CURRENTLY SUPPORTING UKRAINE,
HOW MUCH MORE DO WE HAVE TO
OFFER WITH THE CONSTRAINTS
ALREADY PUT ON THIS THERE?
>> ACTUALLY, THIS IS A
DIFFERENT KIND OF FIGHT THAT IN
UKRAINE.
THIS IS NOT JUST A QUESTION OF,
YOU KNOW, THOUSANDS OF
ARTILLERY SHELLS AND THE SORT
OF FORCE ON FORCE BATTLE YOU
SEE IN UKRAINE.
THIS IS A COUNTERINSURGENCY
OPERATION.
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS WE CAN DELIVER TO ISRAEL
IMMEDIATELY'S INTELLIGENCE
SUPPORT.
LET'S BE HONEST HERE, THIS IS A
MASSIVE ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE
FAILURE UNDER THE NETANYAHU
GOVERNMENT.
THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK
THAT HAPPENED WITHOUT ANY
WARNING WHATSOEVER.
THE UNITED STATES, FROM WHAT I
UNDERSTAND, WAS ALSO TAKEN BY
SURPRISE.
WE HAVE INTELLIGENCE ASSETS ALL
AROUND THE WORLD, WE HAVE
INTELLIGENCE ASSETS THROUGHOUT
THE MIDDLE EAST.
THAT'S THE IMMEDIATE SUPPORT WE
CAN PROVIDE THE ISRAELIS TO
HELP THEM AND NEUTRALIZE
IMMEDIATE THREATS TO FINDING
HOSTAGES, TRACKING DOWN THESE
