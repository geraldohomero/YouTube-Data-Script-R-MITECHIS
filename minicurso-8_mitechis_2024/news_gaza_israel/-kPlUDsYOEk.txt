These Israeli activists fill a
truck with a few bags of flour
and food cans a symbolic action
To show that they care about the
humanitarian crisis that crosses the
civilian population of
Gaza everyone understands that there are
Hungry in Gaza everyone understands
that if the people of Gaza are happening
Hunger Israeli hostages too
They are suffering normal life cannot
continue here when a
150 km catastrophe from VI
Security and the future of the Israeli people
G Enel where activists gathered
Standing is the police truck
also arrived to escort these
activists at least part of the road
truck takes the road to the crossing
of Kem Shalom followed by a few tens
of automobile activists but at 3
kmos of the final destination a blockade
police force activists to
lap
The police that established a
temporary blocking point and said it is
a military quarantine area we receive
many screams and discomfort of
passerships say it is thanks to
that all this is happening that
We are traitors to our own country
that we are betraying the hostages and
to those who were killed on 7
October a large majority of the population
Israeli opposes these
activists for weeks some have
even to block the passage of
Humanitarian aid at crosses towards
Gaza apart from the procession show
his
disagree keep the aid out no
is just threatening our future
our future as a people here but
It is also harming the reins
From there I understand your anger but this is not
is the form of
demonstrating it is the second time in a
week that these activists have been
repelled by the police near the crossing
but they say they are still motivated and that
important for them is also the
message and what symbolizes and that
They will return to
do it
