This board that is written behind me is the road
But Shiba starts this area and it
The last stop is for the southern Lebanon and tomorrow
Which has happened in the incident in which two journalists are
One public has been killed, four others who are cow slaughter
That incident happened in this area actually
You can see behind me continuously
Which is the sound of a drone that is of aircraft
The voice is being 24 hours since yesterday
And this is the area of that border if you
These hills will see behind me
This is the whole area of Palestine behind me
And only these hills in South Lebanon
There are people from where there is a flood
Is not between Israel and Lebanon and
People who are easily from here to Israel
These hills can be hit in the area
What you are looking after me, that's why
Israel from the monitoring drone here
Is keeping and the thick of Hizbullah is complete
The area is the hills behind me here
If there is a war from Hizbullah
In the same hills in Israel
Slip or under the guise of these hills
If you have missiles and rocket stains on Israel
This is why there are 2400 hours here
These aerial aerial is the movement of Ire Vikal
In which not only
They are engaged that cameras are installed
Rather, at the same time with bombs in them
Those who are controlled by Israeli army
If they have any activity anywhere
If seen in the area of southern Lebanon
He falls there and drops bombs from that drone
And many such accidents which are the last several days
Has been seen in this entire area during
And along with that artillery fire
Israeli army tax on Hizbullah's locations
It has been and the fighters of Hizbullah are
There are also attacks from Rakut and Miza Ilo
And here experts say that come
This front can open in the days
Is in the middle of Israel and Hizbullah
Ashraf Wani is a war between the two
