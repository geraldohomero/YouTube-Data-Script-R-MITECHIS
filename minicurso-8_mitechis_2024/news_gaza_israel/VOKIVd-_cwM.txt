We have to talk about something a lot
Less much less fun and is
The opinion of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister in
relation to the possibility of creation
of a Palestinian state when
They begin to analyze the possibilities of
that this war is dismantled is solved
One of the possibilities would be the
creation of a Palestinian state too
so that both nations have a country
consolidated something that he does not approve in
Absolute in fact this situation happened
by the parliament of Israel because
Inside Israel there are also voices
dissidents is not a unanimous voice that
supports the destruction of Palestine or
much less but there is a great
resistance even within the government
to stop the siege in the strip
of Gaza with which there was talk of this in
Parliament this happened Thursday and
There he voted in favor of the rejection of
any unilateral recognition of
a Palestinian state because the community
International asked for efforts to
achieve what he calls the solution of
The two states well that does not have the
approval of the ruling of Israel the
Parliament approved the opposition with 99 of
The 120 legislators in favor clearly
There is a tendency in favor of sedio and in
against the Palestinian state but there is
exactly 21 legislators who think
otherwise or at least they have their
Muices Israel rejects dictates
International on an agreement
permanent with the two states and one
solution to this conflict that is
will only achieve negotiations
direct without prior conditions the
Palestinian Foreign Minister said in
a statement the same day as the
Israeli decision is to challenge the
International community from the UN No
They require the approval of the government of
Israel and all countries can
recognize the state of Palestine without
request permission from this country with the
which could eventually happen that
The main powers promote the
creation of this state and that Israel
agree or not have to
supporting this measure will not have to see the
Minister instit the Israeli government to
Recognize the Palestinian State about the
Base of International Law and
Implement the solution of the two
states something that is still very
