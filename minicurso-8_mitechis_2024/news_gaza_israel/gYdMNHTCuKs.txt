>> Todd: A FOX NEWS ALERT, 
SIRENS BLARING NOTHING ISRAEL AS
THE CEASEFIRE ENDS AND FIGHTING 
RESUMES.
GREG PALKOT HAS THE LATEST.
GREG.
>> Greg: AFTER A WEEK'S PAUSE, 
THE FIGHTING IS ON, THE WAR 
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS IS 
RAGING AGAIN.
WE ARE A MILE FROM THE NORTHERN 
PART OF GAZA STRIP, OUR LOCATION
HERE, I WILL STEP ASIDE AND LET 
CAMERAMAN BEN GIVE YOU A SENSE 
OF THE LANDSCAPE.
WE'VE BEEN SEEING AIRSTRIKES AND
HEARING ARTILLERY.
YOU MIGHT SEE SMOKE COMING FROM 
THERE.
THERE WAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SMOKE
A HALF-HOUR AGO, AGAIN, WE'RE 
HEARING AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE, SIGN 
OF CLASHES ON THE GROUND, THERE 
COULD BE THOUSANDS OF ISRAELI 
SOLDIERS THERE.
STRONGEST STRIKES IN THE GAZA 
STRIP, HAMAS STRONGHOLD, HOW DO 
WE GET HERE?
BOTH SIDES BLAMING EACH OTHER.
ISRAELS SAYS HAMAS DID NOT 
PRESENT ADEQUATE SET OF NEW 
CAPTIVES TO BE RELEASED BEFORE 
CEASEFIRE WAS SET TO END, HAMAS 
SENT OFF ROCKETS TO NEIGHBORING 
VILLAGES WHERE WE ARE NOW.
THAT WAS FOLLOWING THAT, ISRAEL 
ANNOUNCED IT WAS RESUMING 
STRIKES, HITTING A VARIETY OF 
LOCATIONS, GOING FOR THE 
TEMPORARY HEADQUARTERS OF HAM 
NEAR KHAN YUNIS.
WE HEARD DOZENS HAVE BEEN KILLED
ACCORDING TO HAMAS.
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU 
RELEASED STATEMENT SAYING UPON 
RESUMPTION OF FIGHTING WE 
EMPHASIZE THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ISRAEL IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING
THE GOAL OF THE WAR.
RELEASING THE HOSTAGES, 
ELIMINATING HAMAS.
REMEMBER LAST NIGHTS WE DID SEE 
THE LAST FOR NOW IT SEEMS OF 
RELEASED HOSTAGES, SEVEN WOMEN 
AND ONE MAN, STARTING TEENAGE 
LEVEL.
NEGOTIATORS ARE LOOKING TO 
RESTART THE CEASEFIRE, EXPERTS 
SAY THAT IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN.
LOOKS LIKE WAR AGAIN.
REMEMBER, GUYS, AS WE WATCH 
THIS, WATCH ISRAELI AIR FORCE 
HIT TARGET AND SEE SMOKE COME 
UP, HEAR BOOMS, THERE ARE STILL 
HOSTAGES THERE, TOO, MAYBE 140 
HAVEN'T BEEN FREED.
RETRIEVING HOSTAGES AND DEALING 
WITH HAMAS IS A DOUBLE-BARRELLED
TARGET A
