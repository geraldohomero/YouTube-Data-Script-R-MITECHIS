The fire of war went on further enraged
The attacks from Israel are stopping
Hamas has reduced attack
24 hours if you talk about Israel's attack
Non stop air strikes on gaz

Israel's army on the last night
Bombing for eight hours, let us tell you that
So far, Israeli attack in 10 days

400 people died every day
Think about which point the war has reached
And these figures are only from Israel
Also 1300 people have died so far
The thing to think is that so many attacks and
Even after so much death, it is not visible
When the war will end with air strikes

Start a big ground operation at any time

A big convoy has also been seen by Israel
The challenge is also increasing because
They fight together on three fronts
