they sleep with other Sheltering
families at a un School in southern Gaza
but they prefer days at their shattered
home we come here to escape the noise
the diseases and the flu that people

afraid of the
bombing this is an intimate view into a
humanitarian disaster on a vast scale
and one that is entirely
man-made the un's human rights office
says 1.6 million people in Gaza have
been displaced and at least 41,000 homes
destroyed I lost my clothes I lost my
notebooks I lost everything we lost our

Afraid even if I'm killed it's okay our
lives are in God's hands

jumper he was with me in the street
wearing a jumper and shorts a shopkeeper

pair of trousers and said he's like my
