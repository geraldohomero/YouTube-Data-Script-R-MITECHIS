scenes of joy and jubilation for
palestinians soon after the ceasefire
began but this is in gaza the
celebrations are in the neighboring arab
country of jordan
for sure we are very happy because the
victory of hamas is a victory for us
and it's a victory for palestine today
gaza has won and soon palestine will win
all arab nations will enjoy this victory
today we came to express our happiness
for the victory of gaza
but israel says this is not a victory
for hamas
and said it agreed to the ceasefire as
it had achieved its military objectives
but global public support was squarely
behind the palestinian cause as in this
demonstration in indonesia
we will continue to struggle to restore
the rights of palestinians so that they
can be sovereign as we are driving out
of our homes so this kind of thing being
justified by the world is impossible
even ordinary people will not accept it
the outpouring of support wasn't just
restricted to muslim countries like this
one in tokyo
there are muslim people here but i am
here because japanese people also
understand and we respect that position
in new york the celebrations ended in
police intervention after palestinians
and israelis clashed during
demonstrations in times square
back in occupied east jerusalem
palestinians say they are happy the
fighting has ended but also say the
international community must ensure the
root of the problem is addressed
the first and main request for the
ceasefire is to allow
residents to return to their homes
the second request is not entering
al-aqsa mosque beating people attacking
and harassing muslims this is a holy
place for all muslims
it remains to be seen if the peace talks
will make that happen or if israel will
continue to use force to get its way in
occupied palestine
trt world
