let's cross now to iris mackler in
jerusalem
iris what indeed is the latest
i can tell you that both sides are
reeling from the most
intense night the most intense military
operation that israel
has launched we saw airstrikes um
targeting quite interesting the israeli
military says
that there is a network of tunnels
underneath the south of gaza
and that's what they were tunneling
that's what they were targeting
in a combined extra air operation
airstrikes 160 um planes flying in
together with artillery and tank fire
they say it was important to target
these
um these centers these tunnels because
they
are the play the source of rocket
production and also where the weapons
components
are imported so this was um
a horrendous night on both sides there
were massive um
three intense barrages back into central
israel
including seeing that israel had to then
close its airport
you know what's really struck me annette
while i look at this again
it's an extraordinary military model
where the soldiers don't fight with each
other
but the civilians on both sides are
terrified
has any progress been made on the
mediation front eris
we do know that steps are beginning um
but i think nothing significant will
move before
sunday when the united nations security
council is meeting to consider this
we have a representative from washington
an envoy a diplomat here we have
egyptian representatives here too
but i think until the pressure is ramped
up if we go on
past rounds in this conflict what we see
is that it takes a little while but it
that
in the end it's only international
pressure that actually it's only an
umpire
that can come in and tear these two
fighters apart
eric smackler reporting there from
