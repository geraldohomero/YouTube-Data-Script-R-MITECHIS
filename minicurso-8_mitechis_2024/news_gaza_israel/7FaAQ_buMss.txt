the number of casualties in Israel's war
on Gaza are staggering by midday
Thursday more than 7,000 and for those
who have survived the Israeli attacks
it's hell on Earth finally I appeal to
all of
you vote to Stop The
Killing vote for humanitarian Aid to
reach those whose very survival depends
on it vote to stop this madness
you have a chance to do
something to give an important
signal choose Justice not
Vengeance choose to defend the law not
justify its
breach choose peace not more Wars
Palin's un Ambassador was appealing to
General Assembly members to back a
resolution that would demand an
immediate ceasefire in Gaza it's
something the security Council has still
failed to accomplish despite several
meetings thanks to a US veto of any
resolution that doesn't explicitly
include Israel's right to self-defense
when reading this resolution Kamas seems
to be missing in
action the drafters of the resolution
claim to be concerned about peace yet
the
depraved murders who initiated this war
are not even mentioned in the resolution
not even mentioned some 112 countries
are scheduled to speak at the emergency
General Assembly session over the next
two days with an expected vote on a
ceasefire resolution on Friday the
resolution also calls for humanitarian
access for Aid deliveries into Gaza
Jordan's foreign minister Drew Applause
when he criticized the Israeli
Administration for trying to drive a
wedge between religious groups in the
Middle East don't let them tell you that
this is a war between Muslims andw Jews
I stand before you as a Jordanian as an
Arab as a Muslim and I tell you we value
life Muslim Life Christian Life Jewish
life we value the sanctity of Life the
Israeli representative did not say a
word about Palestinian lives shattered
in this war yet the Palestinian one
before him and I do and I say we care
about all lives about all civilians
Muslims Christians Palestinians Jews
Israelis all
Li most countries in the general
assembly are expected to vote in favor
of the ceas fire resolution Friday and
while symbolically isolating Israel and
the US it will not have the force of Law
and will do little to save lives in Gaza
