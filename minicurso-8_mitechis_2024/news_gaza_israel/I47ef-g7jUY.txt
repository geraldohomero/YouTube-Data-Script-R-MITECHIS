Yami Netanyahu does not escape protests
This Sunday tens of thousands of
people took to the streets of
Jerusalem to demonstrate against the
Executive of Israeli Prime Minister
For his performance in Gaza there was also
A mobilization against exemptions
granted to ultra -orthodox Jews in
the realization of the military service a
matter that generates division in the
Government at first failed to protect
to the civilians and then failed to resolve
the problem neither in Gaza nor in the north nor
In the south simply a great failure
We basically ask to be held
elections and change to
GOVERNMENT WE WANT ALL REENS
Return home now if that
It means that you have to stop the
Fire we will both protest
They lengthened for hours and
They starred moments of tension with
Security forces according to several
local media are
Mobilizations against Netan Yahu
massive from the beginning of the war for
His part The Premier offered Sunday
a press conference hours before
surgery that will keep it
some days outside their activities in
The appearance rejected the call
of elections and defended his
management of elections
now in full war just before the
Victoria paralyze Israel during the
less six or 8 months in my opinion
Anyone saying I'm not
doing everything possible to bring
return to the reins is wrong and is
deceptive also claimed that the
land invasion in rafag in the south of
Gaza will be given despite the opposition
International we will go to Rafa and
We will eliminate the ever
there for a simple reason there is no
Victoria without entering Rafa and there is no
Victoria without eliminating battalions from
Never there the executive leader
Israel√≠ faces a serious threat
internal in your unit cabinet
national one week to meet
months of
war
