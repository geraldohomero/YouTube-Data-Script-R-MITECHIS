at 4:00 a.m. Palestinians arrived from
across the West Bank they're in a hurry
to get in line at an Israeli checkpoint
on the edge of Bethlehem they are
laborers who hold special permits to
cross and work in Israel
cheap workers for Israeli boxes
Mahmoud Abbas an aide left his home near
Hebron at 2:00 a.m. in the morning his
family of five children depend on his
job in Israel out of the world of soccer
over here on the ground nothing will
change
on the contrary things will be getting
worse we are facing the same
catastrophes every day without any
important this is the reality and
Trump's visit won't change anything as
dawn breaks Palestinians become more
frustrated and desperate
this is the daily struggle for thousands
of Palestinian workers they have to
endure this humiliating crush in an
Israeli controlled checkpoint they want
to work on the other side of the wall
the West Bank Labor Association reports
that 15,000 workers pass through the
checkpoint every day and a min Jabril is
flat out selling them tea and coffee
he's been working here for ten years and
has seen it all alike today it's a very
bad deal look if you look here it's a
terrible situation the worker with a lot
of hours the award before there any work
you know leaving the checkpoint you
drive close to Israel's separation wall
it cuts Palestinians off from their land
and families on the other side
British artist Banksy recently opened a
hotel full of his artwork right next to
the wall it's received plenty of
international attention and tourists
but for people who live here life is
hard and they want US President Donald
Trump to understand what they're going
through the wall the restrictions all
the factors of abnormality
speak to itself speak to the others and
that's what mr. Trump while visiting
Bethlehem is supposed to see Trump isn't
planning any sightseeing in Bethlehem
just business but if he was it's
unlikely his tour would include this
