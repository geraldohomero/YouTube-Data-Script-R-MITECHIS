 
THE BRIDGE IS REMOVED. 
>>> HAMAS HAS RELEASED A NEW 
VIDEO APPEARING TO SHOW AN 
ISRAELI AMERICAN HOSTAGE TAKEN 
CAPTIVE DURING THE OCTOBER 7th 
ATTACK. 
THE VIDEO CANNOT BE 
INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED, BUT 
APPARENTLY SHOWS HIM, AND IT 
SPARKS PROTEST BY FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS OF HOSTAGES OUTSIDE 
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN 
NETANYAHU'S RESIDENCE. 
THEY ARE DEMANDING THE PRIME 
MINISTER DO MORE TO BRING THE 
HOSTAGES HOME. 
CBS NEWS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT 
DEBORA PATTA SPOKE TO  HIS 
MOTHER IN JERUSALEM. 
>> Reporter: RACHEL GOLDBERG IS 
AN OPPRESSIVE WOMAN. 
SHE MAY BE SMALL IN STATURE, 
BUT WHEN SHE FIXES YOU WITH HER 
STEELY MOTHER'S GAZE, YOU DARE 
NOT LOOK AWAY, AND NO WONDER 
SHE MADE THE TIME 100 LIST THIS 
YEAR FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS, 
OF COURSE. 
HER 23-YEAR-OLD SON WAS 
KIDNAPPED FROM THE NOVA MUSIC 
FESTIVAL ON OCTOBER 7th LAST 
YEAR, AND SHE HAS NOT HEARD 
FROM HIM SINCE THEN. HER LAST 
MESSAGE, THE LAST MESSAGE SHE 
RECEIVED FROM HIM AT THE 
FESTIVAL ON OCTOBER 7th LAST 
YEAR WAS, I LOVE YOU. I'M 
SORRY. 
THAT WAS, OF COURSE, UNTIL 
YESTERDAY WHEN THE HAMAS 
PROPAGANDA VIDEO SURFACED. 
WE CANNOT INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY 
THAT, AND CLEARLY, HER SON WAS 
SPEAKING UNDER DURESS. 
YOU COULD SEE HIS AMPUTATED HAND
YET THAT IS AN INJURY THAT WAS 
SUSTAINED DURING THE ATTACK. HE 
WAS FENDING OFF AND TRYING TO 
PROTECT HIS FRIENDS WHEN THAT 
ENTRY WAS SUSTAINED. AS SOON AS 
THAT VIDEO HAD COME TO LIGHT, 
RACHEL AND HER HUSBAND JOHN, 
IMMEDIATELY RECORDED A MESSAGE 
WHERE SHE SAID VERY STRONGLY, 
LOOKING AT THE CAMERA, STAY 
STRONG. I LOVE YOU. 
SURVIVE. 
WE SPOKE TO HER EARLIER TODAY 
ABOUT SEEING HER SON ON THAT 
HAMAS VIDEO FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAD TO 
SAY. 
YOU HAVE MIXED EMOTIONS WHEN 
YOU SEE YOUR SON FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN 200 DAYS YESTERDAY. 
>> IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE. I 
WASN'T EVEN REALLY LISTENING TO 
WHAT HE WAS SAYING. 
I WAS JUST HEARING HIS VOICE. 
I HAVEN'T HEARD HIS VOICE IN 
SIX MONTHS. HE IS CLEARLY 
MEDICALLY COMPROMISED THE 
MEDICALLY FRAGILE. 
>> Reporter: LANA, I HAVE A 
DAUGHTER THE SAME AGE AS 
RACHEL'S SON. THEY MAY BE 
ADULTS AT 23, BUT THEY ARE 
STILL YOUR CHILDREN, AND HER 
IDENTITY IS AS A MOTHER, AND 
SHE IS GOING TO TURN
