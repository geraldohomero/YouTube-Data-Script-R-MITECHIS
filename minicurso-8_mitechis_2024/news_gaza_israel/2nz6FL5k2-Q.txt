Those who died in Israeli Gaz war so far
Number has crossed 3500 but
How much more will be known in this now
Hard because war is intensifying
And Israel has given an ultimatum that she
Soon of Tanks and Ground Troops
Through the Gaza strip will climb at this time
I am present in the Farah area where
Terrorists entered and they got these cottages
Broke and this is from here in the history of Israel
That mark to start a new war
Leave it due to which Israeli is strip
There was no bar ment in the area
But now preparations are being made for the attack
Air via ground troupes and tanks
Strike continues continuously and this area
Is in which not only in cottages
People were killed and their houses were broken
But many people have also been taken hostage
And the same hostage is now more for Israel
The border remains a cause for concern
People of Hamas came crossed by Hamas
Terrorists first attack from this border
Sticking with adjacent border
In the area with cottages where people
Used to come to celebrate his weekend but now
The picture of terror for the elimination of Hamas
Israel will become history written here
Opportunity for and covering that history
Jagwinder Table and through ABP News
Manish Sharma has also got all these
Looking at things, it is going to be a history
It has been and the marks of this history from here
Will start and Hamas is waste
If terror is wasted then it begins
Will be from this village where ruthless people
Innocent people killed innocent
People were killed, he was murdered
They were kidnapped by kidnapping them
Hamas terrorists and still taken with him
The way the dirty is coming here smell
It is not just ammo but
It looks like a lot in debris
People's dead bodies are still inside
We will be buried, so we update Palpal
Will keep giving you but on ground zero
What happened, who did it for the first time
You are listening through ABP News
