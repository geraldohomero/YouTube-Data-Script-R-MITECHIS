This is exactly of Israel and Gaja Strip
There is a border area and here is a water
End defense is a building that is
Now you can see what kind of stir
Which is a truck of Israeli army which is tank
Which is the Bakvan vehicles and which is of safety
Other equipment is taking them towards the border
About 2700 feet from here
What is at a distance of Gaja is the area of Gaja
It starts and very much in this sense
Sensitive area is from here
Through those who are broken by breaking the wall of security
Hamas terrorists entered and this
After coming to the city, he created a furore and
As we have repeatedly told that it
They do not come to the city only
Slapped but mostly from here
If you take people abducted and then what is now
These types of safety situation here
Are that the police barricading is like this
It is engaged and which is a lot of flaws
Hums terrorists walking such a big attack
Could do it
Now what is trying to finish
There is no terrorist attack again
But still try this from Hamas
To attack again and rocket
The attack through it is happening
But even in the internal, there is still something that
He is a terrorist that he is being told that Israel's
Is on the ground and therefore such barricading
Through this type of ticketing which is any
Efforts are being made to stop the apprehensive attack
And when we are talking about this here
The time that is the voice of the blasts, it comes continuously
There is rocket firing that is happening
But here is the Israeli with the promptness
The security personnel are deployed because
The Gaja Patti from here is just a few thousand
A few 100 kg is at a distance of 100 meters
