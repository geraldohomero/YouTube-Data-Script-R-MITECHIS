after a moment of
silence Israel's national anthem Echoes
through quiet crowds outside the
European Parliament in
Brussels we are here with the president
of the European Council the president of
the European commission and all of you
as one to express our
solidarity inside a group of Israelis
bustles between meetings with
parliamentarians making the case for
more
action we meet Noam As She lays out
photos of loved ones 11 of whom are
presumed kidnapped by Hamas look at this
family
okay they are not only Israelis many of
them shushan she is a German citizen as
well we are really asking for the EU to
take responsibility and bring their
citizens back home after the horrors now
the weight is agonizing they burned all
the houses they killed everyone and they
took them and we are just trying to save
whoever is still
alive the European union says it stands
with Israel but the block has also
warned the country against blocking
supplies to Gaza cutting water cutting
electricity cutting food to a mass of
Civilian people is against international
law so yes there are some actions that
are not in accordance with international
law that's why Leila wafi is terrified
too hailing from Gaza we meet her at her
home outside Brussels as she frantically
tries to get family members out of the
strip but they're
trapped where can they hide they've
nowhere to run to they're starting to
run out of milk bread drinking
water Leila rejects the actions of Hamas
and the Israeli
response killing civilians has never
Advanced the Palestinian
cause we've always said too that killing
Palestinian civilians does not make
Israel
safer on both sides now we are Weeping
mothers we are parents searching for our
children we are both at the mercy of
extremist politics we share the same
pain but in opposing
camps for now all those watching from
afar can do is hold on whether taking
solace in a whispered prayer for
peace or a song of Hope
hanging in the
