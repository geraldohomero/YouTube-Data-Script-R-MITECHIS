OREN LIEBERMANN, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH.
DANA, BACK TO YOU.
>>> IN THE WEEKS SINCE THE 
OCTOBER 7th ATTACKS IN ISRAEL 
KILLING THOUSANDS ISRAELIS, 
INCLUDING WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND 
DOING SO WITH SOME BARBARIC WAY,
WE HAVE SEEN A RISE OF 
ANTI-SEMITISM AROUND THE WORLD, 
PARTICULARLY HERE IN THE U.S.
JEW HATE, SENATE MINORITY LEADER
CHUCK SCHUMER, JUST ADDRESSED 
THIS CRISIS IN A POWERFUL SPEECH
ON THE SENATE FLOOR.            
>> I HAVE NOTICED THE 
SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY BETWEEN 
HOW JEWISH PEOPLE REGARD THE 
RISE OF ANTI-SEMITISM AND HOW 
MANY OF MY NON-JEWISH FRIENDS 
REGARD IT.
TO US, THE JEWISH PEOPLE, THE 
RISE OF ANTI-SEMITISM IS A 
CRISIS.
A FIVE-ALARM FIRE THAT MUST BE 
EXTINGUISHED.
FOR SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE OF GOOD
WILL, IT IS MERELY A PROBLEM, A 
MATTER OF CONCERN.
AFTER OCTOBER 7th, JEWISH 
AMERICANS ARE FEELING SINGLED 
OUT, TARGETED AND ISOLATED.
IN MANY WAYS, WE FEEL ALONE.
>> MELANIE ZANONA JOINS ME FROM 
CAPITOL HILL.
IT'S SO INTERESTING TO HEAR 
SOMEBODY LIKE CHUCK SCHUMER SAY 
WHAT HE JUST SAID AND REALLY 
TAKE UP THE MANTLE TO SPEAK FOR 
JEWS IN AMERICA IN A WAY THAT WE
DON'T ALWAYS HEAR JEWISH 
LEADERS, EVEN CHUCK SCHUMER.
>> IT IS PERSONAL.
HE'S THE HIGHEST RANKING JEWISH 
LAW MAKER IN THE COUNTRY AND SHE
FELT COMPELLED TO SPEAK OUT AND 
TO DRAW ATTENTION TO WHAT HE 
VIEWS AS A CRISIS IN THE 
COUNTRY.
HE TIPPED OFF A NUMBER OF 
INCIDENTS, AND HE ALSO DESCRIBED
WHAT IT FELL LIKE TO HEAR SOME 
OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS SAY THAT 
THE WAR WAS JUSTIFIED IN SOME 
WAY.
A MESSAGE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
DIRECTED A THE SOME OF THE 
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY.
THIS COMES AS CONGRESS HAS BEEN 
WRESTLING WITH AN AID PACKAGE.
AS OF RIGHT NOW, THAT PACKAGE 
REALLY HINGES ON WHETHER THEY 
CAN FIND BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT ON
A BORDER SECURITY PROVISION 
PACKAGE.
 THAT IS THE COMPLEX ISSUE.
AS YOU KNOW, IT'S SOMETHING THAT
IS LONG ALLUDED WASHINGTON FOR 
MANY YEARS.
WE'LL SEE IF THEY CAN GET IT 
DONE.
AS OF RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE TRYING
TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS HOPING TO 
GET A HANDSHAKE ON THAT PART OF 
THE PACKAGE.
COULD SEE SOMETHING ON THE 
FLOOR, BUT IT'S A HIGH TASK OVER
HERE IN CONGRESS TO GET 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT DO
