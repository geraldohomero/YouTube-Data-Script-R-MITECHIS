what happens in the Gaza Strip and in
The nearby East also has
impact on different Arab countries or
Islamic or both Iran is not Arabic is
Persian but is Islamic but what happens in
Morocco and especially in the capital of
Moroccan kingdom this weekend about
All this Sunday there were demonstrations to
favor of Palestine and the concretion of
a Palestinian state that from the
Balf declaration of 197 a lot
promised but the United Nations
Thanks maybe if that had happened
If Rabin lived if Arafat lived more

They received some
Solution but of course this is

Not as ever happened either anything
what we are seeing happened
demonstrations in the capital of the kingdom

To protest against normalization

achieved by China's mediation we will see
What happens to that and this is also

The Palestinians of the Gaza Strip
according to the authorities in the march that
ran from the door of the Medina
from Rabat to Parliament
14,000 people like me participated

showing dead and injured Palestinians
In gauze also chefa which is what
is he
Palestinian scarf that is black and white
contrary for example to Jordano
What is red and white what is carried

Notorious that this manifestation for the
independence or in favor of Palestine in
A country like
Morocco especially when it is true
Palestine always needed to have a
State but also the old Sahara
Spanish Sahara needs to be a state
Sure to Morocco should absorb him
as your own territory when too
It would have to be independent since
protest for a thing we can also
protest on another that is exactly
equal to
