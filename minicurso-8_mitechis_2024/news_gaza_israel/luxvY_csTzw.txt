We travel to the Middle East again in
This case to talk about at least 40
victims in the last hours for
Crying attacks by the Army
Israeli who is still looking for goals
terrorists inside the Gaza Strip
the Palestinian territory that is
bordering Israel and from where they have
The unfortunate attacks arose and that
They gave rise to a massacre a little more
a week ago and from where
They are still launching new attacks on
through missile rockets and fire
Artillery against Israel in this case
You have to talk about at least we insist
40 dead after Israeli bombing in
gaza that also offers images such as
that we see on screen Bran this gives the
feeling not to keep climbing
day by day
internationals trying to generate

And the door would really open to a
hell even worse in the area Si Israel
attacks and reaches for example
rescuers or Egyptian soldiers who
are working in the imagine area
that there are a job
humanitarian and they really attack them
That would give rise to an even more scenario
terrible huh everything suggests that
then while they are operating the
Egyptians in the area this would not lead
to a massive escalation of that
