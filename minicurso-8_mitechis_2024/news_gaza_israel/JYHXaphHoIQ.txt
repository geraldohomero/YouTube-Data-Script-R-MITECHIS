was a palestinian minor
who was reported to be around 13 to 15
year old was killed by israeli army
with live fire on his stomach during a
protest
in the occupied west bank in a club in a
very in a place very close to an
illegal um settlement outpost he wasn't
killed in a place where
it was a like a normal place under
international law
west bank and east jerusalem is under
israeli occupation and
those um settlements are illegal so
uh those palestinians like abu aliyah
um was trying to protect their land as
the inhabitants of the land
uh by doing peaceful protests and in
front of them they found
an army that is fully acute and fully
armed and when we look at abu aliyah he
was only around 13 to 15 year old and he
was
an unarmed person and when we look at
the reaction of israeli
israeli side israeli army said um
israeli idea spokesperson said soldiers
had used what
uh the spokesperson described as riot
dispersal means which means
uh firing rubber bullets only to
confront
dozens of palestinians i also
investigated three years ago
the what are those rubber bullets
whether they are lethal or not
they are really little i have to say
adam because
despite the fact that we call them
rubber bullets they are actually rubber
coated steel bullets and it really
penetrates the body
even though uh abu aliyah didn't die
with the
um live fires he would most probably he
died with the
rubber-coated stimulus that can
penetrate to the body and
when we look at the code of conduct of
israeli army those rubber bullets
shouldn't be
fired above belly and when we look at
the situation of abu aliyah
he died with the wounds in his stomach
so it's a
it's a definitely a kind of killing that
should be investigated by
israeli uh israeli officials and also
israeli army officials
