the harvest season is over and all 13
men who worked on this Vineyard in
Southwest Israel before October 7th
remain
today even when 7,000 agricultural
workers chose to return to
Thailand like everyone else who lives
and works in this country they know what
to do when the air rate siren goes
off we would do exactly what they did he
tells us we would run to the safe room
the entrance to the tie worker safe room
in kibutz near o feels like a moment
Frozen in
time while Hamas militants went on a
rampage some of the workers sought
Refuge here but instead they were
slaughtered one look inside and no
description of the massacre that
unfolded is
needed 16 men used to live and earn a
living on on this kibuts working the
fields and sending money to family back
home five of them are unaccounted for
the rest are confirmed dead there's not
an inch here that hasn't been ransacked
or destroyed behind me one of the
bedrooms it's covered in blood and you
can still smell after a whole month the
stench of
death there was nowhere to hide and
there was no mercy shown to
foreigners
dozens of Thai men were killed that day
along with other foreign laborers as for
those missing Thai officials have been
given no proof of Life all they know is
what they've seen in photos and
videos and based on that they believe 25
are being held captive by Hamas in
Gaza we do hope that the first group of
host should be should have some Thai
people it's believed that Thai National
make up the second largest group of
hostages after Israelis how do you
explain what happened to the Thai
workers given that they have absolutely
nothing to do with the Israeli
Palestinian conflict that's what we
don't understand as well you know the
Tai people they came here to work in the
farm in in agricultural
sector officials in Thailand say they've
held direct talks with Hamas in Iran
bypassing Israel and have been told Tha
hostages would be released at the right
time as Israel's war against Hamas rages
on when the right time could be is
anyone's
guess Daniel hamam Jin Global News in
