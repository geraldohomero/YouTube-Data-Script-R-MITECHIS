THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FOR HIS
STEADFAST STAND AS WELL AS
PROJECTING HIS VISION TO THE
REGION
>> THIS WEEK, TOP ISRAELI
CABINET MEMBERS CALLED FOR THE
RESETTLEMENT OF PALESTINIANS OUT
OF GAZA.
SOME OF THE MOST STRIKING
LANGUAGE THAT WE SAW COMES FROM
THE HERITAGE MINISTER WHO SAID
FRIDAY ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF GAZA,
QUOTE, YOU WILL NOT BE HERE.
YOU WILL NOT LIVE BY OUR SIDE
AND THAT IS THE MAIN POINT
WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO
LEAVE THE PLACE.
TWO OTHER CABINET MINISTERS HAVE
MADE SIMILAR STAPLES
IS THIS FORCED DISPLACEMENT OF
PALESTINIANS FROM GAZA THE
OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT, MR. PRESIDENT?
>> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY NOT,
TOTALLY NOT AGREED AND IS NOT
THE POSITION OF THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT OR THE ISRAELI
PARLIAMENT OR THE ISRAELI
PUBLIC, BUT WE ARE ADEMOCRACY
AND IN A DEMOCRACY YOU HAVE A
VARIETY OF IDEAS AND IN A
VARIETY OF IDEAS AND IN A
SOCIETY WITH WHERE STREET SPEECH
IS THE BASIS OF OUR NATURAL DNA,
PEOPLE CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY
WANT
SO IN A CABINET OF 30 MINISTERS
WHERE IT'S NOT A SECURITY
CABINET A MINISTER CAN SAY
WHATEVER HE WANTS.
I MAY NOT LIKE IT, BUT THIS IS
ISRAELI POLITICS, AND BY THE
WAY, YOU HAVE IN AMERICA PEOPLE
WHO SAY THINGS WHICH YOU DON'T
LIKE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S
THE POLICY OF THE
ADMINISTRATION
SO SAME GOES HERE.
THEY'RE SPEAKING ABOUT THE
WILLFUL LEAVING OF THE GAZA
STRIP AND I'M SAYING OUTRIGHT
OFFICIALLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY,
THIS IS NOT THE ISRAELI
POSITION
WE SHOULD, REMEMBER, HOWEVER,
THE NATURAL PSYCHE HERE.
WE ARE IN DEEP TRAUMA IN THE
LAST THREE MONTHS.
WE ARE SEEING -- WE HAVE SEEN SO
MUCH AGONY, PAIN AND SADNESS AND
MAY I REMIND ALL THAT WE STILL
HAVE OVER 130 ISRAELIS FROM
BABIES, FROM TODDLERS DUE TO
CELEBRATE ONE YEAR OLD IN A
WEEK'S TIME ALL OF THE WAY TO
85-YEAR-OLDS AS WELL INCLUDING
PEOPLE WITH HOLOCAUST
BACKGROUND
SO BECAUSE OF THAT, OUR NATION
IS BEREAVING, IS WORRIED, IS
