Benjamin Netanyahu under a lot of
pressure over the weekend, unwilling to
accept responsibility for the Hamas
attacks, which he then kind of walked
back all the walk us through what we
need to know on that front.
Yeah, and the context here is important.
So in the months that led up to this
attack before this, you know, Israel has
been deeply divided country and really
around Benjamin Netanyahu and what his
government is trying to do.
Many support it, but many are against
the judiciary reform, where tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands of
people took to the street on a weekly
basis to object.
The second this attack happened, many of
the same people who protested against
Benjamin Netanyahu rallied against the
war effort.
And so over the weekend, Benjamin
Netanyahu put out this tweet saying
basically that it was the security
apparatus fault for not warning the
prime minister and the prime minister
didn't know anything that every
assurance he had from them was that
Hamas had been deterred.
Of course, this was very poorly taken
for many of the people who are even
critical, critical of Netanyahu.
They've been fairly quiet, particularly
in international media.
And for the prime minister to come out
and say this.
Many found shocking.
He got he was attacked within even his
own defense cabinet.
And so the question is longer term,
again, he has not taken personal
responsibility for any of the events
that have occurred.
He says some tough questions need to be
answered eventually, including by him.
But that's about the extent of it.
And again, we have to pay attention to
this because the long term political
domestic future of Israel is going to be
absolutely crucial in terms of how they
go about dealing with the Palestinian
question in the future.
