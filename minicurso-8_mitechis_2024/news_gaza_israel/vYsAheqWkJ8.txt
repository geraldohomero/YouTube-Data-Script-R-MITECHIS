D
FOR CANADA-CHINA RELATIONS?
WELL, JOINING ME NOW IS CHARLES
BURTON, A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE
MacDONALD LAURIER INSTITUTE.
HE WAS PREVIOUSLY A COUNCILLOR
AT THE CANADIAN EMBASSY TO
CHINA.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE, Mr.
BURTON.
I WANTED TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU
MADE OF THAT TENSE EXCHANGE
BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU
AND PRESIDENT XI.
I MEAN, THE BODY LANGUAGE WAS
CLEARLY COLD WITH PRESIDENT XI
BARELY EVEN LOOKING THE PRIME
MINISTER IN THE EYES.
>> WELL, AND I THINK IN ADDITION
TO THE BODY LANGUAGE, THE ACTUAL
CHINESE LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED
WAS THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA WOULD
NEVER USE TO THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
IT WAS ROUGH, DISDAINFUL, YOU
KNOW, THREATENING, MENACING.
IT REALLY BORE A RESEMBLANCE TO
THE KIND OF WOLF-WARRIOR
DIPLOMACY THAT WE ARE SEEING OUT
OF SOME CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY
OFFICIALS AND SOME AMBASSADORS.
BUT ONE HAD NOT SEEN PREVIOUSLY
OUT OF CHINA'S HEAD OF STATE, XI
JINPING, AND ESSENTIALLY, YOU
KNOW, HE DRESSED DOWN TRUDEAU
FOR RELEASING INFORMATION ABOUT
THIS TEN-MINUTE INFORMAL CHAT
THAT THEY HAD IN A CROWDED ROOM
YESTERDAY.
SAID THAT HE HAD
MISCHARACTERIZED THE MEETING.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR
NOT, BUT HE MIGHT HAVE A POINT.
AND THEN ESSENTIALLY SAID THAT,
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST
AND CREATE CONDITIONS FOR US TO
COMMUNICATE AND IF YOU DON'T, I
CAN'T SAY WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES
WILL BE.
SO THAT WAS FAIRLY, YOU KNOW, IN
TERMS OF THE USE OF THE CHINESE
LANGUAGE, IT WAS FAIRLY
MENACING, SUGGESTING THAT WE MAY
BE SEEING SOME CHINESE
RETALIATION COMING UP,
PARTICULARLY ONCE OUR INDO --
INDO PACIFIC POLICY IS RELEASED
WHICH MAY CONTAIN A LOT OF
LANGUAGE THAT CONSTRAINS CHINA'S
ESPIONAGE AND HARASSMENT AND
POLICE OPERATIONS HERE IN CANADA
IN ADDITION TO CANADA GETTING
MORE INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE
UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA AND THE
U.K. AND IN SECURITY MEASURES IN
THE INDO-PACIFIC REGION.
SO I -- DISDAINFUL TONE --
>> I'M SORRY, ONLY GOT ABOUT 30
SECONDS.
>> WHAT DOES THIS DO FOR
RELATIONS GOING FORWARD NOW,
THOUGH?
>> I THINK ANY ILLUSION THAT WE
MIGHT HAVE THAT WE CAN
COLLABORATE WITH THE CHINESE ON
THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND
GLOBAL HEALTH ARE NOT GOING TO
BE HAPPENING.
CHINA'S SERIOUSLY TICKED OFF AT
OUR PRIME MINISTER AND I THINK
AT CANADA, AND I DON'T THINK
THEY WILL BE MEETING AGAIN
