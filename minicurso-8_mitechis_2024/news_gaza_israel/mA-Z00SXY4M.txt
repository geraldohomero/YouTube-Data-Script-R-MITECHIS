it's been just over a month since Hamas
rampaged through the kibuts of kafar AAR
in southern Israel you can see the
damage the roof is completely collapsed
here the whole house is burnt
down just everything overturned in here
just
ransack door smashed off its
hinges bullet holes
everywhere but the recovery is still not
over number of the house for the Jewish
religion we need to bury the whole body
not only one part so that includes blood
teeth bones
anything that means the volunteers are
going through every house looking for
every spot of blood every piece of Flesh
from the 60 residents slaughtered
here so this is all blood on the ground
you can see the red of
and bily
fluids as we're standing here we can
hear firing V Gaza what do you think
about the war
there I think we should almost do what
they did here he says but then he
corrects himself saying he regrets that
and
revenge we don't want revenge he says I
just want people to feel they can live
peacefully
here you can see smoke rising from Gaza
it also shows you how close this kabut
is to the Gaza Strip it's only about
three kilometers away and you can also
see here the fence that Hamas came
through when it broke into the kabut on
October 7th 63-year-old iset kazir has
returned to her home to gather plants to
place on the grave of her husband who
was murdered in the Hass
attack all my life I used to be on the
left wing but now I realize it's not
just now I realize uh it's wherea the
them or us I don't want to kill them of
course not the innocent people
but we tried every solution we got
outside Gaza we gave them um electricity
we gave
them a fuel we gave
them food Israeli artillery firing right
yeah yeah it's Israel that Israeli rage
over the atrocities here I mean there's
little hope that the horrors now in Gaza
will end soon soon either
