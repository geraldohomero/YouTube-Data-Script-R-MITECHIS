>> Dana: FOX NEWS ALERT.
WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS AS TREY 
MENTIONED TOP OF THE HOUR THE 
SITUATION IS TENSE NEAR THE 
BORDER WITH LEBANON.
JONATHAN HUNT IS FOLLOWING THIS 
FROM LOS ANGELES.
JONATHAN, WHAT DO YOU SEE?
>> WELL, DANA, WHAT WE'RE 
HEARING NOW IS THAT THERE HAS 
BEEN SOME SORT OF INCIDENT RIGHT
ON THE BORDER BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
LEBANON UP IN THE NORTH OF 
ISRAEL THERE.
WE'RE WAITING CONFIRMATION FROM 
THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES.
BUT WHAT WE ARE HEARING IS THAT 
THERE WAS SOME SORT OF EXPLOSION
AT A BORDER CHECKPOINT RIGHT ON 
THE ISRAELI BORDER WITH LEBANON.
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT 
EXPLOSION, THE ISRAELI TROOPS 
THERE UNLEASHED ARTILLERY FIRE 
ACROSS THE BORDER INTO LEBANON.
THAT STRIP OF SOUTHERN LEBANON 
IS WHERE THE MAIN HEZBOLLAH 
SETUPS ARE.
NOW, THAT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE
HEZBOLLAH IS A FAR BETTER ARMED,
FAR BETTER ORGANIZED 
ORGANIZATION THAN HAMAS IS.
IF HEZBOLLAH WERE TO ENTER THIS 
CONFLICT IT WOULD CHANGE THE 
FACE OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST ENTIRELY.
YOU ONLY NEED TO LOOK BACK AT 
2006 WHEN A VERY SIMILAR THING 
HAPPENED.
THE KIDNAPPING OF AN ISRAELI 
SOLDIER TAKEN INTO GAZA, THEN 
THREE WEEKS AFTER THAT, 
HEZBOLLAH STARTED FIRING ROCKETS
ACROSS THE BORDER.
THERE WAS A CROSS BORDER 
SKIRMISH.
IT TURNED INTO A FULL BLOODED 
WAR BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 
HEZBOLLAH.
THAT IS THE THING THAT PEOPLE 
FEAR NOW THAT HEZBOLLAH COULD 
COME INTO THIS.
AND IF HAMAS IS BACKED BY IRAN, 
AS WE KNOW THAT IT IS 
FINANCIALLY, THE ADVERTISE 
BETWEEN HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN ARE 
GREATER.
HEZBOLLAH WILL NOT ACT WITHOUT 
IRAN KNOWING ABOUT IT, GIVING 
ITS GO AHEAD.
IF HEZBOLLAH UP IN LEBANON GETS 
INVOLVED IN THIS CONFLICT, IT 
CHANGES THE FACE OF EVERYTHING, 
DANA.
IT IS NOT GOING TOO FAR TO SAY 
THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE GAME 
CHANGER IF THIS STRETCHES INTO 
LEBANON AND A WAR WITH 
HEZBOLLAH.
>> Dana: THANK YOU.
THE PICTURES YOU ARE SEEING TO 
THE LEFT OF YOUR SCREEN.
THAT IS THE BORDER OF ISRAEL AND
LEBANON.
WE DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY IF 
THAT'S T
