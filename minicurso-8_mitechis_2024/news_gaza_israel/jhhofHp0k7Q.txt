Hamas and Hizbullah in Israel Gaza War
Fighting a direct fight with Israel but
This battle is as easy to listen to the reality
I am not as easy because Israel and
Hamas behind each other's staunch enemies
America and Iran also behind the curtain
This is why Israel is fighting war
It is not easy to defeat Hamas
Actually Israel's staunch enemy Hizbullah
Many attacks on Israel in the last five months
Israel has shown support for Kar Hamas
Also with its strong air defense system
Many on Hamas and Iran -backed Hizbollah
In the recent times of Israel
The counter attacks have intensified and its reach
It is also big which has increased the concern that
Things can be out of control and this
War can also spread in the middle East
If the war spreads to the middle East, its heat
It is set to reach Iran
Israel's Defense Minister Yoga Eland
Also recently indicated that Israel
Hizbullah in the event of Gaza ceasefire
Attack to remove fighters from the border
Planned to increase

If you attack Israel Hizbullah now
If it increases, what is the role of Iran in it
Will be quoting sources about this
The head of the Quds Force of Iran was told
Ismail Kani visited his Beru in Fabry
But Hizbullah leader Syed Hasan Nasrullah
Also meet
According to sources of
Kani had discussed that if Israel next
If the bar will target Hizbullah then it is one
There will be an aggressive attack which Tehran's main
Regional partner severely damaged
Can reach sources
North of Lebanon between Alla and Kani
Also on the possibility of full Israeli attack
Conversation

In such a situation, if Israel attacks
Shia Islam Group ie Hizbullah
Along with damaging to Iran too
There may be pressure to respond to the attack
Although Nasar Allah in the meeting to Kani
Assured that he does not want Iran
Stuck in war with Israel or America
So Hizbullah on his own
[music]
Those who know these discussions will fight
A queen was quoted as saying that
Nasar told Kani that this fight is ours
Although US State Department Israel Government
This case from Tehran and Hizbullah
I have not received any comment yet
