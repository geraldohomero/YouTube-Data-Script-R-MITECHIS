>>> DURING LAST NIGHT'S ADDRESS,
PRESIDENT BIDEN SUPPORTED
ISRAEL'S MISSION TO ELIMINATE
HAMAS IN GAZA BUT HE SAID ISRAEL
HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT
INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND WARNED
NETANYAHU'S GOVERNMENT THAT
HUMANITARIAN AID CANNOT BOW A
BARGAINING CHIP.
THE PRESIDENT UH-UH NOUNCED
PLANS TO CREATE A TEMPORARY PORT
ON GOODSA'S COAST TO HELP
INCREASE THE FLOW OF AID INTO
THE ENCLAVE.
CHRIS LIVESAY HAS BEEN FOLLOWING
THIS FROM ISRAEL.
WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU IN THE
ADDRESS LAST NIGHT?
>> WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME WERE THE
APPLAUSE LINES WHEN HE TALKED
ABOUT GAZA.
HE STARTED BY SAYING EZERAL HAD
THE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AFTER
THE ATTACK ON OCTOBER 7th.
BUT PROGRESSIVES WHO HAVE BEEN
EXTREMELY CRITICAL OF ISRAEL AND
THE WAR EFFORT, HE ALSO SAID
ISRAEL HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY TO
PROTECT CIVILIAN LIVES ON THE
GROUND.
>> THE LEADERSHIP, TO ISRAEL ARE
I SAY THIS.
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE CAN'T BE
A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION OR A
BARGAINING CHIP.
PROTECTING AND SEVENING INNOCENT
LEAVES HAS TO BE A PRIORITY.
AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE, THE
ONLY REAL SOLUTION TO THE
SITUATION IS A TWO STATE
SOLUTION OVER TIME.
>> NOW THE KEY PHRASE YOU MAY
HAVE MESSED THERE WAS OVER TIME.
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS
BEEN INSISTING ON A TWO STATE
SOLUTION NOT JUST FOR THE
PALESTINIANS BUT ALSO FOR THE
LONGTERM SECURITY INTERESTS OF
THE ISRAELIS.
CONSIDERING THE CONFLICT, THE
TENSIONS POLITICAL AND
OTHERWISE, IT DOESN'T TEAM LIKE
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN
OVERNIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT ALSO ANNOUNCED THE
CONSTRUCTION OF A TEMPORARY
HUMANITARIAN PIER, RIGHT OFF OF
THE COAST OF THE GOODSA STRIP.
AND THAT THE U.S. MILITARY WOULD
OVERSEE THAT.
HE EMPHASIZED THAT DOESN'T MEAN
U.S. BOOTS ON THE GROUND BUT IT
WOULD MEAN CRITICAL AID COMING
TO PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED
IT, SOME OF WHOM ARE DYING ON
STARVATION.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WATER,
FOOD, MEDICINE, SHELTER.
HOWEVER, WHAT HE DIDN'T MENTION
IS HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO
BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
IT NODES TO BE SHIPPED IN.
IT IS CURRENTLY IN VIRGINIA AND
IT HAS TO CROSS THE
MEDITERRANEAN AND I
