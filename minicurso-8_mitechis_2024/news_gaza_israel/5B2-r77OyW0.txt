This new climbing began on Monday of
This week when Israel arrested Baz√°n
to Saadi a leader of Islamic jihad
Explain to us what this group is
What is its difference with Hamas and what
unites them in front of their opposition to Israel
How about good afternoon
Islamic Yihad in Palestine is a group
both political and militant then
It is difficult to separate it and in that sense it is
Very similar to other Islam groups
political that we place as Hamas as
hezbollah that have so much part
policy as parties that exercising a
legitimate power and the militant part
Palestinian Islamic Yihad is different
It has a separate structure but it is
very aligned in ideological terms and
even coordination with Hamas perhaps
We could say that I have Islamic
Palestine is a little more
intransigent or is less willing
negotiate that ever but in terms
general are very similar in terms
ideological and both have their main
The Center for Operations at home and had
in mind that jihad is much more
little to never tell us how much
They can worsen the clashes
between Israel and this militant group
A very interesting phenomenon is that in
In recent years we have seen an increase
quite substantial of the level of
militancy of political power that has
Islamic jihad
And we know by the way that I will
You are providing quite financial aid
Islamic jihad then everything seems
seems to indicate that some have a
arsenal then considerable rocket that
It does not mean that you have the capacity
to face the Israeli army or
Much less but I think it has the
ability to continue
At least doing this type of
rocket attacks towards Israel by
several days maybe a couple of weeks and it is
that the situation continues short Israel
From Monday all accesses to Gaza
How much is impacting this on
basic implements such as supplies
of energy and the implements of the
hospitals
Well the situation is very serious from
Before it was very serious but since
These blockages were already all the
Gaza Strip The main good good
Energy plant has already run out of
fuel then currently and
We hope you continue for a few days
five more days of bombing for
less the entire Gaza strip is without
light because the plant simply does not
It has fuel
