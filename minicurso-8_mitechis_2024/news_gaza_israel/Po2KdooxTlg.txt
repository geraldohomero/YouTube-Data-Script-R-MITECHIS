in this small studio in the gaza strip
sharif expresses his rejection of
israeli policies in art
i want to draw pictures that show the
world that we are an impressed people a
shackled people and a people under
occupation i have drawn pictures of
martyrs prisoners the sacrifices of the
palestinian people in general
and sharif says by painting at the
border he's made himself a target
as i was painting a picture of razan
al-najar one of the martyrs i was shot
at six times but i resist the occupation
with my brush and i completed my
painting during that attack i was
injured in my hand
i was also shot while painting at the
border two other times once in my
shoulder and once in my leg
despite the dangers he and his
apprentice packed their gear and head to
the border to join the friday protests
this time he wants to paint a picture of
karampha yab
he is a palestinian who was shot and
killed by israeli security forces at the
border with gaza
this is the face of karam fayad i was
there when he was killed i helped carry
him away today i'm here as an artist and
i want to draw karam's face to honor the
memory of this martyr and to show the
occupation that the memories of the
martyrs are alive in our hearts today
sharif's apprentice ahmed says he's
determined to carry on
we will continue this work and we are
sending a message to the israeli
occupation that we are steadfast and we
will not give up because pictures like
this one express the pain of the
palestinian people caused by the israeli
occupation
sharif believes resistance may come at a
heavy price
but it's one worth paying
if he can capture its essence with each
stroke of his brush
