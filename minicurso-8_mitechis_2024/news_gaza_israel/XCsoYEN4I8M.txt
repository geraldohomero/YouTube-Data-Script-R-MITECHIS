hello
hell I want to know where you
are after 12 hours of waiting at the
border this woman is finally safe
perfect you're with your colleagues from
the Consulate General of France and
Egypt this crisis unit that was set up
in the wake of the Hamas attacks is
working day and night 24 hours a day 7
days a week to get French out of the
Gaza Strip there are a dozen still
trapped while more than a 100 have
already crossed into Egypt hello so

[Music]
stand the problem is we've lost
contact making contact is extremely
complicated for those who are still in
Gaza Israel regularly cuts off all
communication with the outside
world
we've lost
contact the French Consulate in
Jerusalem makes its citizens a priority
as well as local staff and their
families all measures are taken to make
them feel that they are not
alone we managed to provide them with a
little material assistance such as phone
credit so that they can maintain an
important link with their families in
France we've also managed to get nappies
to mothers who need them for their
babies and we've managed to get medicine
to
people we've got people who've been
through an enormous amount of hardship
over the past months who in a very poor
psychological
State France is negotiating directly as
well as through
intermediaries as we know the situation
on the ground is particularly volatile
there are bombings there are very
complicated negotiations whether with
the Egyptian authorities the Israeli
authorities or the authorities in Gaza
some of whom we speak to
directly others with whom indirect
exchanges take place through
intermediaries are part of those
negotiations the French Consular in
Jerusalem is also keeping a very close
eye on the situation in the West Bank
and for French people in Jerusalem in
general
