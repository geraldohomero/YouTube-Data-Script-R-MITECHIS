if you'll permit me um personal
aside I come before you not only as the
United States Secretary of
State but also as a
Jew my grandfather Maurice
blinkin fled pilgrims in
Russia my
stepfather Samuel
pizar survived concentration camps aitz
daau maidon
so prime minister I understand on a
personal
level the harrowing Echoes that hamas's
massacres carry for Israeli Jews
indeed for Jews
everywhere I also come before you as a
husband and father of young
children it's impossible for me to look
at the photos of families
killed such as the mother mother father
and three small children
murdered as they sheltered in their home
in kubats near
Oz and not think of my own
children this was just one of hamas's
countless acts of
Terror in a Litany of brutality and
inhumanity that yes brings to mind the
worst of
Isis baby Slaughter
bodies
desecrated young people burned alive
women
raped parents executed in front of their
children children in front of their
parents how are we even to understand
this to digest
this and yet at the same
time at the same time that we've been
shocked
by the depravity of
Hamas we've also been inspired by The
Bravery of Israel
citizens the grandfather who drove over
an hour to a cubots Under Siege armed
only with a pistol and rescued his kids
and
grandkids the mother who died shielding
her teenage son with her
body giving her life to save his giving
him life for a second
time the volunteer security teams on the
kotzas who swiftly rallied to defend
their friends and neighbors despite
being heavily
outnumbered and we're lifted by the
remarkable solidarity of the Israeli
people demonstrated in the long lines of
people giving blood in the hundreds of
thousands of reservists who've mobilized
some rushing home from
abroad people around the country opening
their homes to fellow citizens displaced
from the
south the people of Israel have long and
rightly prided themselves on their
self-reliance on their ability to defend
themselves even when the odds are
stacked against
them the message that I bring to Israel
is this you may be strong enough on your
own to defend yourself but as long as
America exists you will never ever have
to we will always be there by your
side that's the message that President
Biden delivered to the Prime Minister
from the moment this Crisis
began
