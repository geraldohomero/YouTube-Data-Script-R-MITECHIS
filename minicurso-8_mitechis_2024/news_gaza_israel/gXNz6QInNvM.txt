It finally goes through a decisive momentum and
irreversible to implement the
Two solution
States our partners in the region
especially Jordan works there
Let's work with them we are ready to
contribute to it in Europe and the council of
security recognition of a state
Palestinian is not a taboo for the
France We owe it to the Palestinians
whose aspirations were too
long trampled we owe it to
Israelis who lived the largest
Massacre emite of our century we
owe to a region that sucks in
escape chaos and
Sensions of
revenge humanitarian access is
today very insufficient look
today civilians to civilians
Gaza dies of hunger and illness I
also reiterated it to the Prime Minister
Israeli you must open the port of ASHD
You also have to open a land route
direct since Jordan which can
become a humanitarian platform
complementary to Gaza at
which France is ready to
finally contribute you have to open all the
crossing points including north of
The Gaza Strip where the situation is
dramatic

We do need to work very closely to
Achieve in Lasting Seas Fireire Gazza An
Israeli Attack on Rafah where Nearly 1.4
Now 5 million people have been pushed
Into A Small Air to Take Shelter from
The NAGOING DEVASTATION WILL HAVE
Catastrophic Humanitarian Consequences
that cannot be accepted the destructive
War Onaz and the Escalations in the West
Bank and in jerusalem continues their
Effect Will Extend Far Into the Region A
Political solution that leads to peace
As you Said mr President on the basis of
A Two State Solution is the only way to
Guarantee Security for the Palestinians
The Israelis and the Entire
region
