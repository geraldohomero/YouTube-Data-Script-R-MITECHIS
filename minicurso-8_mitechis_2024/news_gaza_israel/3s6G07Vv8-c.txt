they fell in love after he fixed her car
and they eventually got married
but most of the time ismail and his wife
have to use whatsapp to communicate
i just wish i had a home for me my wife
and my son to live together so i could
go to work and come back to them
that's because ismail lives in the
occupied west bank and his wife hanadi
lives in east jerusalem
israel's military issues blue id cards
to palestinians there those cards give
them residency and the right to work and
travel between israel east jerusalem and
the west bank
but it's not a passport and they don't
have citizenship
but ismail has a green id card it
doesn't let him enter jerusalem without
permission from israel being married
doesn't change that
they have to maintain two households one
in the west bank
and one in east jerusalem
i pay more than five hundred dollars for
rent and other services my husband pays
250 for rent this is too much i used to
live with him in abu ghosh but i
couldn't tolerate the conditions there
and they say the expense is only one of
the difficulties they face
according to rights groups like
bitsa-salam checkpoints restricting
their movements make it hard to make
plans for a future or even complete
simple tasks like scheduling a hospital
appointment
or making it to work on time
another couple
melhim
have lived like this for 16 years
he has a blue card and hers is green
they're concerned for their children one
born in the west bank has a green id the
other two were born in al-qudz in
jerusalem but they're still waiting to
be issued ids
i hope my children will be given al kudz
ids just like other children there
but even if their children do get the
blue cards they'll still be stateless
and the family will still be forced to
live apart
