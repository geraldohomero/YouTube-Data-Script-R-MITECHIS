Han -gu, where Gangneung -do, Gangneung -do
The inner sea into the sand field
It has changed, excavators are stretched
The sand was 2.5m, but
Like land in the sandy sand
It's a place where I am in the original
It is the inside sea, but people like this
The sand continues to be able to walk around
It is accumulating, but
Fishing boat 40 is over pus
Tied up, some fishing boats hit the floor
Even damaged
This is the first time this is the first time
It's not about a month ago
The sanded sand is piled up like a pile
The fishermen are completed 2 years ago
It's because of a nearby thermal power plant
Claim 1.2km in length
Existing seawater as the breakwater is installed
Sand movement by interfering with the flow
It has changed abnormally
I couldn't get hungry because of the blockage of sand
There was no, but in 30 years,
From 2 years ago, the power plant vitality
Power plant now, while making moorings now
Due to construction, a large amount of sand
Inflow
On the contrary, the North Hashimi -dong
The sand dunes are reduced by the waves
Outgoing coast erosion
Seriously formed 2400 years ago
Tens of meters of coast
Sleeping no one is all.
To be designated as an ecological landscape conservation area
Ecological preservation value was great, but now
Like an anti -erosion project like a monster
It has changed
Sand sedimentary erosion
I can't recognize the breakwater liver relationship
It was revealed. Gangneung -si only recovered
Repeat
There is
I know it's under review and it takes about it
There is a fundamental measure
In the late late, the nature of the heavens is recovered.
It is difficult to get ruined
Damage continues to continue YTN
