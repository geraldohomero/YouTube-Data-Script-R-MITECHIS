South Africa now while
praetoria authorities continue to
Press to stop fire to
Gaza of South African citizens have
joins the ranks of the Israeli army
But for Naledi Pandor the Minister of
Foreign affairs his soldiers or his
troops these men will be in any case
arrested and brought to justice if they
come back to the country the explanations of
Caroline
Dumet how are there to fight from the
side of the Israeli army impossible to
say but we see from time to time on
Social networks the false of these
South Africans who proudly pose in
The ruins of Gaza then the
Proalestinian civil organizations

on their site or listen to them
information he gives it does not prevent
person to come and fight for Israel
All they say is do not post it
not on networks
Social Sympathizers
Propalestinians also asks that
These South Africans Fallen oneself from their
nationality a measure almost
impossible to apply because according to the
Constitution a South African cannot
lose your nationality only if it has been
naturalized
