 
LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE BORDER 
POLICY.
>> Sandra: WE ARE GOING TO KEEP 
OUR EYE ON THE LIVE PICTURES.
ANY MOMENT NOW, WE ARE EXPECTING
TO GET AN UPDATE FROM THE 
PENTAGON WHERE THIS IS ALSO A 
LIVE PICTURE AS IRANIAN BACKED 
PROXIES CONTINUE TO ATTACK U.S. 
TROOPS AND SHIPS IN THE RED SEA,
AND COMES AS PRIME MINISTER 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYS HE WILL 
BLOCK THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
PLANS TO LET THE PALESTINIAN 
AUTHORITY, WHICH CURRENTLY 
OVERSEAS THE BEST BANK, TO TAKE 
OVER GAZA ONCE THIS WAR ENDS.
TREY YINGST IS ON THE GROUND IN 
SOUTHERN ISRAEL.
TREY, HELLO TO YOU.
WE JUST LEARNED SOME SAD NEWS 
ABOUT MORE HOSTAGES.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US RIGHT NOW?
>> WE ARE LEARNING ISRAELI 
FORCES HAVE RECOVERED THE BODIES
OF TWO ISRAELIS INSIDE GAZA.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WARRANT 
OFFICER WHO WAS KILLED ON 
OCTOBER 7TH AND A CIVILIAN 
PREVIOUSLY SEEN ALIVE AFTER 
BEING KIDNAPPED FROM THE MUSIC 
FESTIVAL.
TWO ISRAELI SOLDIERS WERE KILLED
AND OTHERS WOUNDED.
DAY 67 OF THE WAR IN HAMAS, 
GALLANT PROVIDED NEW INSIGHT 
INTO OPERATIONS ON THE GROUND.
GALLANT EXPLAINED THEY ARE 
ENCIRCLE LING TWO NEIGHBORHOODS 
IN NORTHERN GAZA, AND HOPE TO 
GATHER NEW INTELLIGENCE FROM 
FIGHTERS.
GALLANT LAYING OUT THE GOALS FOR
ISRAELI TROOPS.
>> ISLAM WILL TAKE -- ISRAEL 
WILL TAKE MEASURES TO DESTROY 
MASS BUT WILL NOT STAY 
PERMANENTLY IN THE GAZA STRIP.
ONLY TAKE CARE OF OUR SECURITY 
AND THE SECURITY OF OUR CITIZENS
ALONGSIDE THE BORDER WITH GAZA 
AND ELSEWHERE.
>> ISRAELI FIGHTING AGAINST 
HAMAS COMES AS A NEW SCREENING 
AREA OPENED TO SPEED UP THE 
REVIEW OF HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE.
THE CROSSING WAS USED TO ENTER 
GOODS FOR ISRAEL, AND NOW USED 
TO SCREEN AID TRUCKS ENTERING 
THE ENCLAVE.
THEY HAVE TO CROSS THROUGH EGYPT
SO THE ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY AFFECTS
THE SCREENING PROCESS.
YESTERDAY, 61 AID TRUCKS ENTERED
GAZA AMID INTERNATIONAL CALLS TO
RAMP UP ASSISTANCE TO 
PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS.
ALL OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS COME 
AMID RENEWED ROCKET FIRE INTO 
NORTHERN ISRAEL.
