and our correspondent in Israel Claire
de Hamel was on the border
today between Israel and Egypt
She observed the aid situation
humanitarian
Place we are here on the border
Between Israel and Egypt it is by this
passage point that the aid transit
humanitarian aid intended for Gaza it is
inspected in Israel before returning
on the other side of the border for
then be sent to Gaza by the
Rafa passage point but
Today you can see it behind
me there are dozens of Israelis who
came to block this inspection
humanitarian aid because he considers
that it is diverted by Hamas and
that in war and well Israel
should not help her
enemy we know nothing about what is
Arrived at Sacha we do not know if he is
alive or what he needs to
Stay alive there is nothing
humanitarian aid in what Hamas does
So it's a little bit hypocritical of
continue to attack us with
Help questions
humanitarian we have prevented
hundreds of trucks to supply the
Hamas is him enemy only the
Hamas not the civilian population
Palestinian and instead of watering them
help we try to stop everything
This many alert organizations
For several weeks on fate
Palestinian civilians in Gaza we have
asked one of the organizers if
thought that their action could have
a consequence on these civilians dependent
This humanitarian aid is what it
we answered then we have no
No one here has the ambition to refer
and the civilian population of
Palestinians of de Gaza we are in
war at present it is a bit
more than 130 days of war if we want
that this war ends Hamas
must be destroyed and dismantled this
will be good for the civilian population of
Palestinians in Gaza and it will be
Obviously very good for Israel too
it is manifestations they are especially
symbolic since humanitarian aid
She still manages to reach
The Gaza Strip every day but
according to most organizations
International there is not enough
of trucks that return to Gaza and the
Risk of famine for civilians
Palestin is very real
