this is a moment of togetherness in the
very worst of
times amid the horror children across
the strip are somehow able to escape
their reality even if only
briefly in this refugee camp inah some
Palestinians have decorated their tents
just as they once decorated their now

homes but festivities here are muted
under the constant buzzing of Israeli
drones
