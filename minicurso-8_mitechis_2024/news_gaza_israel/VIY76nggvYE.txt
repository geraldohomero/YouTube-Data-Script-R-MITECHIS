every single one of these men
they might not have been heroes in the
sense of they won a medal
but what they did
was just heroic in and of itself my name
is cole nolan
i'm a local historian from gardner first
nation here in northern ontario
and i focus on
indigenous soldiers from the first world
war at the beginning of the first world
war it was actually officially mandated
by the canadian government that no
first nations no indians would be
recruited
nearly 4 000 canadian
first nations men joined the armed
forces between 1914 and 1918
during the first world war first nations
men didn't have to join they weren't
compulsed in any way to do so like there
was no conscription for first nation
soldiers
um
it's incredible it's incredible to think
about
these guys they enlisted in an army
to fight for a country that didn't want
them to exist at that point in time
and just the fact that you know they had
to overcome all these obstacles to do
that
the residential school factor can't be
ignored
even in their daily life on the
reservation like everything that they
did in their entire life was completely
micromanaged either by residential
schools or by the indian agent
um the fact that these boys were able to
overcome whatever childhood traumas
that you know were might have been
dragging them down due to residential
school
it's almost like getting into the army
uh suddenly was
a dose of freedom that they never had
before i know it's insane to say uh that
life in the army
in wartime was exponentially better than
being back at home on the reserve but it
kind of was true on the other hand when
they come home
you know after fighting for canada after
living life on an equal footing with
their white comrades overseas the fact
that these guys had to come home and
still had their children taken away from
them to go to residential school that's
a real
absolute tragedy as far as i'm concerned
it's a crime
they weren't all looking to
do something heroic
but
the fact that they did that was pretty
impressive
