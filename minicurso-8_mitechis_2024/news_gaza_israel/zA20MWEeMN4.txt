AND HOPE IT'S OVER BUT AS THE
SUN COMES UP, WHO WAS FIND OUT.
BREAKING NEWS FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE, JACQUI HEINRICH IS THERE,
I KNOW WE HAD THIS MEETING IT
O'CLOCK EASTERN TIME WAITING ON
THE READOUT, WHAT COULD YOU TELL
US?
>> I'LL READ IT TO YOU FOR THE
VERY FIRST TIME TOGETHER BECAUSE
WE ARE WATCHING TO SEE IF
THERE'S ANY INFORMATION ABOUT
HOW THE U.S. COUNSELED ISRAEL
AND WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE
RESPONSE.
THIS STATEMENT READS FROM THE
PRESIDENT, EARLIER TODAY IRAN
AND PROXIES OPERATING OUT OF
YEMEN, SYRIA AND IRAQ LAUNCHED
UNPRECEDENTED AIR ATTACK AGAINST
MILITARY FACILITIES IN ISRAEL.
I CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS IN THE
STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS.
AT MY DIRECTION TO SUPPORT THE
DEFENSE OF ISRAEL, U.S. MILITARY
MOVED AIR DEFENSE DESTROYERS TO
THE REGION OVER THE COURSE OF
THE PAST WEEK, EXTRAORDINARY
SKILLS AND HELPED ISRAEL TAKE
DOWN NEARLY ALL INCOMING DRONES
AND MISSILES.
I'VE JUST SPOKEN WITH PRIME
MINISTER NETANYAHU TO REAFFIRM
AMERICANS IRONCLAD LIMIT TO THE
SECURITY OF ISRAEL.
I TOLD HIM ISRAEL DEMONSTRATED A
REMARKABLE CAPACITY TO DEFEND
AND DEFEAT EVEN UNPRECEDENTED
ATTACK SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE
TO THOSE THAT THEY CANNOT
EFFECTIVELY THREATEN SECURITY OF
ISRAEL.
TOMORROW I WILL CONVENE MY
FELLOW LEADERS TO COORDINATE A
GENETIC DIPLOMATIC RESPONSE TO
IRAN'S BRAZEN ATTACKS AND ENGAGE
WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS ACROSS
THE REGION AND WE WILL STAY IN
CLOSE TOUCH WITH ISRAEL'S
READERS WHILE WE HAVE NOT SEEN
ATTACKS ON OUR FACILITIES TODAY,
WE WILL REMAIN VIGILANT AS TO
ALL THE THREATS AND NOT HESITATE
TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTION TO
PROTECT OUR PEOPLE SO A COUPLE
OF SIGNIFICANT PIECES OF THAT,
THIS STATEMENT FOR THE FIRST
TIME I BELIEVE IS CONFIRMATION
FROM THE U.S. THESE STRIKES
HEADING TOWARD ISRAEL NOT JUST
COMING OUT OF IRAN BUT ALSO
COMING OUT OF YEMEN, SYRIA AND
IRAQ AND ALSO NEARLY ALL OF THEM
WERE TAKEN DOWN BEFORE REACHING
ISRAEL, WE DID HEAR FROM THE
ISRAELIS BEFORE BUT THE LINE I
AM PAYING ATTENTION TO HIS I'VE
SPOKEN WITH NETANYAHU TO
REAFFIRM THE COMMITMENT BECAUSE
WE SEEN THIS NBC REPORT SAYING
APPARENTLY THERE'S CONCERN
WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE AT ISRAEL
MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ACTION THAT
COULD DRAG THE REST FURTHER INTO
REGIONAL CONFLICT SO WE ARE
WAITING DETAIL ON THE.
