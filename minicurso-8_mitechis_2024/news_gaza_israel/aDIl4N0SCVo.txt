earlier we review the sayings of
different referents of the European Union
In relation to the conflict between Israel and
Palestine and another international reference
Nicol√°s Maduro was the president of
Venezuela that proposed an analysis
interesting about it compared what
It occurs in Gaza with the sanctions that
They weigh on their country compared the scope
Of the bombings in the Gaza Strip
that by the way to update the data
They caused more than 7000 Palestinian dead
since the start of the
War
half of your
bombings is like the gas strip
bombings arrive and kill everyone who
find they don't know if he is a boy or girl
This was the bombardment of missiles in
The sanctions fell to everyone
or no or the missiles fell on Maduro
nothing else or sanctions harmed
Only mature good this said it in
relation to the impact they have had no
sanctions especially
Americans about the economy
Venezuelan and how in turn had
repercussions on everyday life not
The inhabitants of this country
Caribbean we listen to a statement from
President of Venezuela that this said
War economy we had to
declare with the sanctions the
bombings is like in the Gaza Strip
The bombings arrive and kill all the
who find do not know if he is a child
little girl
This was the bombardment of the missiles of
The sanctions fell to everyone
or no or the missiles fell on Maduro
nothing else or sanctions harmed
mature as they said that
They asked for sanctions against Venezuela
Not these sanctions must be supported
We ask for sanctions against the country against
Maduro were not against Maduro were
against you business businessmen
working workers movements
social men and women the sanctions
They went directly against
you
