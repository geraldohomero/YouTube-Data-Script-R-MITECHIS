Let's go to the conflict area
To see what are the novelties there
In the Middle East where in the last
hours as reported by the UN continues the
Evacuation of the Gaza Strip this
Sunday the United Nations reported
that one million of the 2300000 Palestinians
Households have already abandoned in the middle of
Israel air attacks that prepares a
great offensive by land per sea and for
Air Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
NEC said that the
next phase of the offensive against the
Palestinian movement ever the attack of
He never caused 1300 dead in his
Most civilians and at least 126
people were taken hostage by
Never meanwhile the bombings of
Israel have killed more than 2300 people
In the Gaza Strip between them to more
of 700 children about 9000 people
They were also injured according to
Palestinian authorities for this issue for
This conflict interviews the analyst
International Ignacio
Ruansi neighboring countries such as Jordan and
Egypt are endorsing their more position

especially worrying that this
tension climb and overpass the borders
concrete from Israel and Palestine eh by
What the call to open a corridor
Humanitarian and also that I do not have
advance with hostilities in the plane
military is a forceful message of
both on the other hand from Lebano Hisbol
Eh aus instead the path of the
violence covered by Iran a visit
concrete Iraní Foreign Minister EH
showing clear support to Hisbol is
also
It is possible to anticipate that participation
So great of Iran in this
Hey also produces concern between
These countries because one of the reasons
for which they have approached Israel
is that they share a common enemy that is
They will go for Türkiye as now
can be expressed beyond
condemn to the situation in Gaza but what
They will also see a common enemy with
Israel in such a way that huh has never
generated an opportunity to put
In crisis this approach with Israel
For the Arab and Muslim world in
GENERAL I think it will have an effect
adverse in that sense that is to say that I think
that will intensify concern
of the Arab world regarding
Iran
