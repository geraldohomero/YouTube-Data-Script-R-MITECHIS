I was never during all these 30s
last years I was in
in conflict areas I never have
summer as much
personally questioned
emotionally in relation to the
situation of this population which
found in Rafa who was forced to
move very quickly that could not
take away with her and who finds herself
now in this city of 2,50000
inhabitants who contain it now
1004

When we get into the hospital
There were a crowd of people at
The interior of the hospital approximately 3000
people in all corridors between
Staircase levels everywhere there
had people who was there who was
Built out of shelter you
have influx of victims of
Bombing of snipers from the
drones also shoot on
Population and that it really creates
such a situation there is no sorting
possible I saw myself on the ground in
try to revive someone
You don't know who is next to you
If it is a simple curious one who comes
Look and CEA in there you have them
children the only place of distraction for
These children are what is happening
The interior of the hospital then they
come they open the carts
urgently they take they take
Gloves to make them 3 balls
days before I leave
Rafa a 3 year old child we amputated his
left arm and we amputated her two
legs what is the future of this child
In this world I have all that as a photo
in my on my phone and I
to say that this is a totally
Disastrous there is worse than killing a
man is to remove his
human dignity and that's exactly this
that you attend Arafat there among
imondices among water and this
cannot evacuate it rained in the same
time people are dirty walk in
in the streets of research do
Queu for water make tails
To try to find food and
This will need to be a fire
immediate you have to see and I
will say it very strongly after 4 months
Hamas is always present Hamas
draw Hamas continues to kill
Israeli soldiers them
hostages are always in the hands of
Hamas what we can agree is
that it's a really a fait in
Before wanting to attack Rafa and
this population there and I love me all
Western countries and Canada also
to intervene so that there is not this
massacre with this population
We would be accomplices to leave
Make Nataniaahou RaphaÃ«l Pti I
Remember that you are a doctor
Anesthesiologist resuscitator you come back
just from Gaza take good care of
YOU
THANKS
