5 months have passed since the moment
In which Israel decides to respond to the attack
of the terrorist group and one of the
most repeated topics in all this time
He had to do not only with deaths
but with humanitarian aid many
times the impossibility of approaching
This aid in a concrete way
overwhelming the border crossing between the
Gaza and Egypt strip I'm talking
Rafat has become in the beginning
on the site where they began to pass
The first trucks with help
humanitarian but hunger has
Representative of the gauze strip in a way
very overwhelming much more serious than
that already existed at that time is not
a new situation but has been recorded
in such a way that the UN has put the eye
On this situation, so also the
I propose for many countries of a
genocide in the gauze strip that
It would be carrying Israel and the
Question what the UN and to the same
Time is answered is if
Effectively Israel is using the
hunger to gain positions against
which negotiates with the terrorist group
Never and above all for what you want
Achieve in the Gaza Strip the hunger of
The Palestinians is a currency
We wonder the UN has warned
About this possibility and said that Israel
Look for concessions of ever and it is
offering to allow the entry of 500
trucks with humanitarian aid a day is
the same amount that gave him when not
There was war 200,000 tents
and 60,000 caravans the rehabilitation of
bakeries and hospitals and the week
Pasada we tell him that there were children
They died of hunger in the Gaza Strip
The UN alert again about the
situation focusing on this topic
But also deepening a position
of the Organization of Nations
Very critical for what is
developing the prime minister
Benjam√≠n Netanyahu in the strip of
loop
