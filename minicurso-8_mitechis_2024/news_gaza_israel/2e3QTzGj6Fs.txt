The trouble of the people of Gaza has increased further
UN relief material supply has stopped
Supply once due to communication block
Food in the gaz and another has come to a standstill again
Supply has been slapped at this time worrying
The news of the people of the news
[music]
UN supply came to a standstill in Gaza
See, some important pictures are also coming out
And some information on that too
If you look at the UN in Gaza
Supply is stalled, UN also says this again and again
There is a communication system again in Gaz
The biggest problem is closed because the biggest problem
There is no fuel internet phone
Communication is stopped for supply for supply
The contact is cut apart from which most
The matter of worry is that food and the other
Essential things like medical
Everything is not able to reach food
The thing is not getting normal soon
If there is no danger of Bukh Mari, Gaza Gaza
Will be born in front of residents
Israel has already stopped supply of fuel
Give and a little bit according to the need
Fuel is also being given but earlier
The way is not the way from the outside
There is always a danger of being cut in different
There is no contact and it is a big
The challenge is Sardana Sir, the question is that
How many days Survivi was cut off from the world
See, even before they were getting ad
Was doing it but the objection that has come
This has come because of these because
He has supported Hums today
Even if the local people are there in the date
If someone is civilians, if someone is to Israel
This gives a little lifeline that this
Where are the hostage if the mortgage is left
So I think of civilians
The plight is getting better, the direction will be better
Only then will Israel be able to help them
Because Israel himself is tied to his hands
That someone is not missing
Even if Israel will not give concession
There are also conditions from the side of
For example, the hostages will have to leave it
Simultaneously who is the top commander of Hamas
All of them will have to decide this mission
Israel is seen growing together
