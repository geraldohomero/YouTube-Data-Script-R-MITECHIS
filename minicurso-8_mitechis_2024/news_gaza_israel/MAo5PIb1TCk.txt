meanwhile the israeli foreign minister
yad lapid is trying pretty hard to try
and distance the israeli government from
the very controversial snooping
software
producing nso group that has been
blacklisted by the united states or
allegations of developing a phone
hacking software by the name pegasus
an investigation by nearly 17 media
organizations published that nso's
pegasus software
had illegally targeted smartphones
of opposition politicians of journalists
and human rights activists
and at least about 10 governments are
reported to be affected by nso's
software
which includes india
saudi arabia the united arab emirates
and mexico amongst others including
france where according to reports even
the french president reportedly was
snooped upon
nso is a private company
it is not a governmental project and
therefore
even if it's designated it has nothing
to do with the policies of the israeli
government i don't think there's another

which have such strict rules
uh according to cyber welfare warfare
uh and uh that is imposing those rules
um more than israel and we will continue
to do so

statement by a senior israeli minister

listing of the software
nso had earlier said that the software
can only be purchased by vetted

is sent to these nations after israel's
defense ministry

sold to these specific governments
the defense ministry launched a probe of
the company's practices after the
allegations were put forth and exposed
nso has said that it was dismayed by the
american decision
for the fact that nso group has now been
put on a blacklist
and it is also added that it put an end
to government agency contracts that had
