says he spent all 76 years of his life
at this home
but his days here might be numbered
the house is in the disputed cheshire
neighborhood and occupied is jerusalem
and last october an israeli court ruled
its build on land owned by jewish
settlers
his family have appealed the decision
but are preparing for the worst
my family for example has prepared
luggage of the important things we need
so that if they come in any second we
will be ready
my dad does not sleep we have a camera
at the house four cameras that show the
street and that stays up until two to
three in the morning just watching if
they are coming to equators
the family says israeli said that they
have already taken over half the
property
according to settlement watchdog peace
now the settlers received a quotes land
from two jewish associations
which claimed to have purchased it more
than a hundred years ago
fifty years ago israel enacted a
so-called legal and administrative
matters law to give people back the
lands they lost in 1948 but it looks
like it's working exclusively for jews
israeli settlers try to make good use of
this law to sue and remove palestinians
living on land they claim is theirs
but israeli india bad salem says the law
doesn't allow palestinians to make
similar claims
court cases such as nabola courts have
been running for decades
and hagerdoffran has been following many
of them
there are tens of families here that has
court cases against them by settlers who
claim that the land here was owned by
jews before 48 and now they are
reclaiming it and
want to take the land and take the
people out in order to build here a big
settlement
and the court recently
ordered
seven houses to be evicted they will try
to appeal but the chances in the courts
are very low
since the 1990s 16 palestinian families
have been evicted from this neighborhood
israeli settlers want more
but nabil says he won't leave unless it
is to the cemetery
mustafa seattle world occupied is
jerusalem
