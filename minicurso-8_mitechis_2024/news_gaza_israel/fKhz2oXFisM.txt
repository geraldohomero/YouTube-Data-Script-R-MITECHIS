between poland and ukraine and i'm here
with ivanka she is a ukrainian canadian
and a teacher and a translator and
you've come here how come you know
honestly watching from back home i just
felt so helpless and i wanted to do
something and then a translator or a
reporter reached out and needed some
translations so i said do you speak
ukrainian can you help and i said all
right great the next day we flew out and
been here since
just sitting here at the border and i'm
looking at all this this flood of people
coming through here what has struck you
the most
obviously the children i mean
they're they're so strong i don't know
what i was expecting to see but the
children are
they're just doing what needs to be done
they're very strong people in general
and
they're like look at this they're
walking they're
for how long i don't know but
they're they're doing what needs to be
done and they're they're strong they
need our help so it's
i don't know it's it's emotional like
it's
i in some ways us volunteers are crying
more than them
and so it's like pull it together this
is not about it's not about you i will
cry later in my room but it's about
being strong for the people who are here
and
now you're volunteering and you you want
to go back in to ukraine and and to do
what
um well there are a few situations where
there are children who are from
orphanages who can't come over because
they have no one to bring them over so
that is one of my areas i will be
translating for the reporter as well
and like i said i
i am trained with fire with a firearms
license
if it comes to that if the war starts
moving west and they need people then i
will stay and do what is needed
a lot of canadians would say why are you
going to fight
because my grandparents were lucky
enough to come over here after world war
ii build over here meaning to canada
sorry
build a life for us
this could have very well been me
and i've heard this a lot through a lot
of people who are volunteering we have
the choice we have the safety
they don't
so it's about just about doing the right
thing
i would hope that if the situations were
reversed someone would want to help me
please be safe thank you thanks
