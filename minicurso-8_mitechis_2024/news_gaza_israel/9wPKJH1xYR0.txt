Iran Iran did not jump in war with Israel
Former Foreign Minister of Foreign Minister about this
Israel has warned a direct battle with America
Former Foreign Minister Mohammad did not land in
This big statement of Javed Jar is a chance to West
It will not be right to give from Javed
Said
Gaya and Rajiv Sir Danti with us
Rajiv sir not giving a chance to west
And now get into this war directly
Wouldn't it be right to save themselves
Step is more visible or whether it is
Worry if Iran will take steps like this
So the whole middle East will be destroyed everywhere
Iran will see Iran, I do not think openly
He will come in front of Hums Hizbullah
The only proxy wall will continue to fight and mine
Believe that within two-three weeks
They have completely eliminated the day
The whole strength of the IDF will be found
This time to eliminate Hizbollah
They will not take any chance the next way
He caught untouched untouchables on 7 October
He is such an opportunity to his people
Not your age country again in the situation
If you put them, they also see the future danger
He will also end it that
This could not happen to them from the future and
See, meanwhile, there is another news in West Bank
There is a big explosion in Bata Camp
This is a big destruction in Israeli operation
See, they come out of the news of a blast in the bank
It is going on in Gaza, the operation is going on
But such reports from West Bank also continuously
West Bank's Balata camp is coming out
In this vigor
[Appreciation]
Break these first photos TV 9 India
But see the explosion associated with this blast
After how the smoke of smoke arises in the sky
Israel is also coming to West Bank
Israel's army has to struggle
And you will remember that from Hizbullah
Mass supporters in West Bank fulfilled this
The entire line is where a confrontation runs continuously
It has been and also a front in front of IDF
Open which is a challenge
At present
