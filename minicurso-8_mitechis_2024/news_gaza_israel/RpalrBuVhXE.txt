It is Rafa in the south of the Gaza Strip
where they have been watching over the morning
the victims of the last Israel attack and
Aviation has bombarded several
housing buildings and between
debris have rescued 13 bodies without
life among them several women and children
there in Rafa next to the border with
Egypt have had hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians who came from the
fighting looking for a place
surely the situation could even
get worse there in Rafa because Israel is
preparing a Netan terrestrial operation
Yahu is rejecting any proposal
of truce and wants to continue with a war
that life has already cost 226 soldiers
Israelis we have talked to the
parents of one of those reservists
deceased Johi is an Inca Jew so
Call Peruvians turned to
Judaism and that arrived in Israel by hand
Of some rabbis I want to live there
I want to work there I want to contribute to
country and if my children are going to be soldiers
I'm going to feel proud I don't have
fear and Johi came to Israel more
20 years here their three children grew
And the three were called to the rows the
Same October 7 on the day of attacks
ever suddenly in less than 24 hours
My three children were in the army
two reservists and the other in the asset
On January 23 Ybal the Major of
The children began a mission in Gaza in
Your tank unit hours after
early morning the father received the worst
News of his life touched the door and
My wife looked out the window and was
an adult soldier and a young soldier
She immediately understood yubal
dead inside the tank that drove and
He died according to the Israeli army for a
ever rocket that caused the
collapse of two buildings died
In that same attack about twenty
Israeli soldiers in what was the day
Most deadly for Israel from the
Start of the war Johi says that
Find out your pain and also
We ask about civilians that
They die in Gaza they are a victim of
those of never have them
subjugates have them frightened says
also that like every Israeli knows that
They must defend the country my son has died
It's true has dead
