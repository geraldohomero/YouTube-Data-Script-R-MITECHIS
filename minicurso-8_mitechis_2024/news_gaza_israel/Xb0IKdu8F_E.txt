The government is thinking about the moment when Mod will be informed
It is here that the attackers attack even at the price that they might
To get hurt
[Music]
Kidnappers are A situation we'll get as far as we can get
To her it is a heartbreaking dilemma of all the decision-maker
We want 138 people here Now before
You do whatever it takes to kill
Our people's even if you're so long
Pull it up
Drop them and there will be no one to bring back who we are
They want to avoid the situation they become
Shields The life of the world you can
Explain to me what all those who say you'll wait for
They want to get to the point where people want to get to The brothers
Our sisters will fall into protective custody
What is this demand for what it comes from
That bothers me is knowing From what is the demand
Turning living people into shields of Sinwar should
Stop it. You just have to stop risking it
Our warriors It's not just my son, it's my friends
And that's all the fighters who are bringing in the Gaza Strip and the poor
Their lives every day Every hour, why
They don’t destroy buildings
Why don't they destroy all the Homs headquarters
The schools are there And all the clinics and all the hospitals
This is Hamas headquarters. Destroy. We have a strong army
We have planes that can For comment
From the top and just blow them up for what they're risking
Our soldiers and our fighters why every day
I need to hear about Three, four dead
We are
Worried about everything
A second from being us and we just feel like it might
And as time goes by, there's probably some kind of attitude
Which is Wrong and we need something else because
We can't talk about continuing the fight
And about assassinations and occupation and about Purge
And about getting into them when we have 138 of our own
Found them
That whatever I say will enter your heart and when you do
You decide Keep that in mind, it’s not just
My granddaughter is the comfort of everyone who's there all
Grandmothers, you know I'll tell you what
That we were on another routine flight back
From our friend's Eilat
