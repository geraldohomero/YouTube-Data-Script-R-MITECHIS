the message that I bring to Israel is
this you may be strong enough on your
own to defend yourself but as long as
America exists you will never ever have
to we will always be there by your
side that's the message that President
Biden delivered to the Prime Minister
from the moment this Crisis began it's
the message that I and my other
colleagues in the government have
delivered to our Israeli counterparts on
a daily even an hourly
basis it's the message that I bring with
me to our discussions today and it's
what I'll affirm when I meet with the
members of Israel's newly formed
National Emergency government we welcome
the government's creation and the unity
and resolve that it reflects across
Israel
Society we're delivering on our word
supplying ammunition interceptors to
replenish Israel's Iron Dome alongside
other defense material
first shipments of US Military Support
have already arrived in Israel and more
is on the
way as Israel's defense needs evolve we
will work with Congress to make sure
that they're met and I can tell you
there is overwhelming overwhelming
bipartisan support in our Congress for
Israel's
security here in Israel and everywhere
we will reaffirm the crystal clear
warning that President Biden issued
yesterday to any adversary
state or
non-state thinking of taking advantage
of the current crisis to attack Israel
don't the United States has Israel's
back we've deployed the world's largest
aircraft carrier to the Eastern
Mediterranean we bolstered the presence
of us fighter aircraft in the
region we're providing other support as
well we continue working closely with
Israel to secure the release of the men
women children elderly people
taken hostage by
Hamas we're pursuing intensive diplomacy
throughout the region to prevent the
conflict from spreading and I'll be
doing that over the course of my trip in
the coming days thanks for watching stay
