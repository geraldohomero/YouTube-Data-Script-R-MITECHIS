dear Palestine sister I write from
Very distant lands from my territory
of Puelmapu Mapuche territory in the south
of Patagonia under administration of the
Argentine state I am daughter of a nation
The nation people also invaded
Mapuche a town that still remembers their
days of freedom when we toured without
borders and wires without our wal
Mapu like your beloved people
sister mine also knows the
injustice the dispossession of genocide the
desolation of being slaves in our
own land the Palestinian people inhabits
my heart for some years
When I knew that there in the distant and
time so close to the Middle East a
history similar to ours was
The original town is happening
Palestinian people invaded by a state
Colonial Israel
Miav the body every bullet that kills in the
life of my sisters and brothers
Palestinians relive the genocide with each
bomb that falls on gaza with each child
murdered I have received from my elders a
very old teaching in the philosophy of
My Mapuche people our quifi kimun me
They talk about yerin to cross the night to
Be a person raising our being as
Humanity I wonder when
We will cross the night what happened to
the Jewish people who also had their
Long and deep night perhaps he stayed in
darkness or have been kidnapped by
who govern nights inoculating the
Worst nightmares maybe the monsters
from the night they have taken control of the
world numbing our senses with
lies loaded we will have
Many yerp dear sister but more
early than late the telluric peoples
We will cross the night and the forces
colonial military will have to
Surrender to the unit of the
peoples to solidarity and force of
justice and brotherhood of a humanity
that in all the confines will follow the
streets convinced that while not
there is justice for criminals no
There will be peace my dear Palestine sister
I want the freedom of your people so much
as I dream of the freedom of
Mine in Palestine we wave sister
Palestine from the South Mapu mountain range
For justice and freedom
Marich
