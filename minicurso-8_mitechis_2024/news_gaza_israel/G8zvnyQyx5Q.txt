no issuing of any kind of statement
after a meeting of the
u.n security council a correspondent in
new york though jessica
misurier says there was still a clear
message for all parties to end the
hostilities
the recurring message at this united
nations security council meeting was
stop killing children it was a call that
was echoed by almost all of the speakers
during this three-hour long meeting
and up until now about a third of those
killed in this conflict
are children this was the third security
council meeting in six days the first
public meeting
u.n secretary general antonio guterres
addressed council members and called for
an immediate end to the violence warning
that fighting could plunge the region
into an uncontainable
crisis both foreign ministers and
ambassadors called for a ceasefire and
for both sides to respect
international humanitarian law but there
was no joint statement from the council
the u.s
will not agree to one u.s ambassador to
the u.n linda thomas greenfield sounded
as though she was in agreement with
european security council members
calling for an end to palestinian rocket
attacks and for both sides to
abide by humanitarian law however the
biden administration
is refusing to agree to a joint u.n
security council statement
condemning the violence the argument
being that it needs
to work behind the scenes to end the
conflict and not
exacerbate it further china's foreign
minister
wang yi who presided over this meeting
because china holds the rotating
presidency
of the security council at the moment
essentially shamed the u.s in front of
the whole world
for its refusal to support a security
council statement the grand irony here
is that this is an excuse we've heard
before from the chinese when it comes to
council statements
on myanmar yet this time it was the
americans
blocking a multilateral response now the
palestinian foreign minister riad
al-maliki
also took aim at the biden
administration's stance and he said
that each time israel hears a foreign
leader speak of its rights to defend
itself it is further emboldened to
continue murdering entire families
in their sleep jessica missouri there
