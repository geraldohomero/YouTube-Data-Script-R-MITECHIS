So now it starts now we're going in
In the Gaza Strip for almost D hours
the Israeli army takes four
Journalists with the edge of the
Fighting zones I too for the first time
I don't get my own impression
Foreign material The morality of the soldiers is
High it is an honor of our country too
defend because we have no other
That is our feeling every time we
to Gaza
Drive in the first stop an eastern one
Gaza Stad's outdoor district We see that
Humanitarian corridor dozens
Palestinians who partly with white
Flags on Saladinstrasse run from
Competed north go into the
He is a safer south four hours
Open today, the colonell tells us
Watch Israeli snipers
The fleeing they don't have
So I have been shot for 12 years
yes again and again in the Gaza strip but that
to see so much now here
Destruction so much sorry that is already
Really
if Israeli or other hostages
Among you are in the column
Don't be afraid to us a little one
Chance maybe to save a hostage
the fleeing is the army
trial calls in several
Languages here are fights between
Hamas terrorists and Israeli
Soldiers also west of Saladinstrasse
right over there because Hamas are not
May the people you as you
human protection
We flee north to the south
the civilians try the citizens of
to separate the Hamasterrorist
the neighborhoods in the buildings here
sit and sit and
Fight for us we go from here
Schia further north towards
Israeli border of one of the
Dearwest populated areas is
Deserts and one
Fighting zone I hear battles entirely in the
It is close here
Dangerous Gzen houses behind us
Are battles between Israeli
Soldiers and
Hamas fighters The location is extremely extreme
tense and so the army ends
our use you determine the rules
It was a short but more important
Insight into the Israeli perspective
But to better understand the war
can be needed for many weeks
both sides what I understood it
is not over for a long time and the more suffering
With Israelis and
Palestinians
