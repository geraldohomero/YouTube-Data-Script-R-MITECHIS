Civilian
May God bless you on Shabbat Shalom
Our forces are deployed throughout the country and
Saturday in a distant land
From home today We all understand that we're fighting for
The house is all ours and we're fighting like
Lions of soldiers and policemen
And the bills are civil
And civilian forces Health and Rescue
And you are citizens of Israel with the great spirit of volunteering
Yours that excites the world
All of us
We are all united again Many will be told about
The heroic act of
In the dark days of pain and sorrow
of the same Saturday
Damn stories that have sung in history
Israel We will never forget what they did
To us
I have also spoken with some of the families today
They lost their loved ones or their fate - Unknown
Their world is a sword
About them I am
Know we'll never forget the sweat act of
Our enemies never will
Forgiven and not given Never or anyone to forget
These votes were not made for the people
Jews for decades
The last of us are eternally at an enemy with a powerless force
- Tikadin - I am
Emphasis is just the beginning
Our enemies have just begun to pay off
The price and I will not elaborate on what comes next
But I'm saying It's just you guys
The beginning of talks with President Biden and with leaders
We are others in the world and in many other efforts we are
Israel has international support
I met with the Secretary of State today
The United States is promising the continuation of the war
With more ammunition coming into the country Middle
Fighting we'll take out the heat
We will
Victory will take time, but we will end the war
This one's stronger than May God will give you
Our enemies rise up against us
We have Saturday before us
