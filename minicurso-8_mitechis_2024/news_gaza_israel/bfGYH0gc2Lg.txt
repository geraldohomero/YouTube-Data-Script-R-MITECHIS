We totally change the focus of the
Information to speak now in what
concerned with the meeting they had with
The prosecutor of the Criminal Court
International Members of the Forum of
Reenes relatives in the strip of
gaza these people not only
Israel but from all over the world
who have a relative or person
nearby that is kidnapped within
the gauze strip by
members of the terrorist group ever and
In this way we highlight what it already says
On the channel 26 screen where the
Criminal Court official
International emphasizes that the attack that
made the terrorist group on October 7
Against the people who circulated
within Israel at that time is one
of the most serious crimes of the
HISTORY OF HUMANITY REMEMBER THAT
In the end of at least two or three hours
More than 100 people were killed
That way in Israel and took advantage of the
official to demand that
immediate and without conditions each of
those civilian people also military
Some are returned to their families
Brian the International Criminal Court EH
as well as Lend say this responsibility
And he questions and judges and never falls for
This cruel indiscriminate attack and
Coward to Israel also refers
to the Israeli counteroffensive when it kills
Stintos organisms civilians
international even
United Nations Organization that is
The most important multilateral organism
In that sense it has already been issued in great
number of times through different
resolutions asking Israel to
Be careful when carrying
forward its counteroffensive which
They recognize that it is fair logical
And that has to do with the state of
War that is lived against terrorism
also take care of the situation of
civilians who still live within the
Gas strip here what is being
doing also is revealing
The need to put on the table what
It also happened against civilians
Israelis that October 7 when
sometimes it seems that the focus
It is only in civilians of
The Gaza Strip and not those who live
within Israel that not only
They suffered the damage of the attack
terrorist on October 7 but also
incessantly from that
Date because even at the beginning of the
program we talked about one of the
Attacks that carried out terrorism
Even in the last hours
Ah
