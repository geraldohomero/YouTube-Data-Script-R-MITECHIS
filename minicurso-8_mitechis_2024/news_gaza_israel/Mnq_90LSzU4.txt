passing minute and we're trying to keep

Israel while Israel continues to pound
many parts of Gaza the suspense is
increasing now over what comes next it's

the Gaza Strip by Israeli forces Gaza is
being bombarded from the air by F16 and
F-15 fighters of the Israeli Air Force

into absolute Rubble hundreds of
Palestinians have already been killed

far the Palestinian Health Ministry says
at least 770 people have been killed and
four 4,000 wounded in the Israeli air
strikes among them 140 children and
120 women these are claims that Israel
says are false figures and that those
killed are only Hamas terrorists here's
