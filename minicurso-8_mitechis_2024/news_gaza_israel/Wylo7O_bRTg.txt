>> WE CONTINUE WITH THE LATEST
>> WE CONTINUE WITH THE LATEST
THIS MORNING.
IN ISRAEL AND GAZA.
ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES REPORT
SIRENS ARE SOUNDING OFF IN
CENTRAL ISRAEL.
>> AND THE SOURCE TELLS NBC
NEWS THAT THE IDF IS CONDUCTING
SMALL RAIDS SPIRIT BEDS IN
GAZA.
AND THAT COMES AFTER THE IDF
GAVE RESIDENTS OF GAZA UNTIL 9
AM EASTERN TO MAKE SAFE PASSAGE
FROM THE NORTH TO SOUTHERN
GAZA.
JOINING US AGAIN NBC NEWS
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, KELLY,
REPORTING ON THE GROUND IN
JERUSALEM.
KELLY WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE
GROUND?
>> SO GAZANS ARE STILL TRYING
TO MAKE THEIR WAY SOUTH TO TRY
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT LULL.
THAT'S PASSAGE ALLOWED VIA TO
ROUTES FROM THE NORTH OF GAZA
INTO THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE
STRIP.
ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES SAY THAT
THOSE TWO ROOTS WILL BE CLEAR
FOR CIVILIANS UNTIL THAT 9 AM
EASTERN TIME DEADLINE.
SO A COUPLE OF MORE HOURS NOW.
AND THERE IS A LOT OF
DESPERATION AND FEAR AMONG
GAZANS IN THE NORTH TRYING TO
MOVE SOUTH.
PEOPLE ARE PACKING UP ALL OF
THEIR BELONGINGS.
THEY'RE PULLING AND STRAPPING
ANYTHING THEY CAN TO THE ROOFS
OF THEIR CAR.
TRAVELING AS FAR AWAY FROM
KANSAS CITY AND THE NORTHERN
PART AS THEY CAN.
BUT LOOK, IT'S A REALLY
DIFFICULT SITUATION IN GAZA
BECAUSE BOTH VOTERS ARE CLOSED.
THE BORDER IN THE NORTH INTO
ISRAEL HAS BEEN CLOSED SINCE
THE ATTACKS BEGAN A WEEK AGO.
AND THE BORDER IN THE SOUTH IS
ALSO CLOSE TO THE BORDER.
THE CROSSING THAT GOES INTO
EGYPT AFTER BEING DAMAGED IN AN
ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE ACCORDING TO
THE EGYPTIANS.
SO IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT
SITUATION FOR THE PEOPLE INSIDE
OF GAZA.
IT'S A TOUGH WAR FOR AID
WORKERS AS WELL WHO HAVE A
LIMITED AMOUNT OF SUPPLIES.
HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES ARE NOT
GETTING IN.
BUT THERE IS MOVEMENT OF
PEOPLE.
AT THE SAME TIME OVERNIGHT,
ISRAEL CONTINUED TO STRIKE
POSITIONS INSIDE OF GAZA.
TARGETING THE STRIKES INSIDE OF
GAZA.
THE IDF SAID.
THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD MANAGED
TO KILLED TWO SENIOR HAMAS
MILITARY LEADERS IN THOSE
STRIKES.
AND THEY'RE ALSO CARRYING OUT
GROUND OPERATIONS.
THEY SAY THAT THEY'VE-LIMITED
GROUND OPERATIONS JUST ACROSS
THE FENCE.
JUST ACROSS THE BORDER TO
TARGET HAMAS OPERATIONS AND
ALSO TO COLLECT EVIDENCE TO
GATHER MORE INFORMATION ABOUT
THOSE HOSTAGES THAT HAVE BEEN
TAKEN.
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY MORE
DETAILED INFORMATION FROM THE
IDF ON EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE
