jerusalem the u.s secretary of state
anthony blinken has held a meeting with
israel's
new top diplomatic lapd in rome and in
his first meeting with the united states

about future and he has
sat down for the meeting with his
israeli counterpart
in the past few years
mistakes were made israel's bipartisan
standing

together
in the past few days i spoke with a
series
of of american leaders both democrats
and republicans
i reminded them all that we shares
america's most
basic values freedom democracy free
markets the constant
search for peace israel has some serious
reservations about the iran nuclear deal
that is being put together in vienna we
believe
the way to discuss those disagreement is
through
direct and professional conversation not
in press conferences we have a number of
things that
the foreign minister has already noted
that uh will be uh
uh on our agenda uh we have of course uh
the uh situation uh in uh in gaza
uh where there is an urgent need both
for humanitarian
assistance and more broadly
reconstruction i know we'll uh we'll
talk about that
the work i hope that can be done to as
you say
offer a more hopeful future
for everyone palestinians and israelis
alike
with equal measures of opportunity
and dignity now this is the first dip
face-to-face diplomatic engagement by
the new israeli government
which was sworn in two weeks ago the
central sierra lepid is israel's point
man to repair tattered relationship
with the new administration in america
now joe biden's democratic party
controls both houses of congress but is
increasingly
divided on the west asian conflict with
progressive members calling for the u.s
to exert
more pressure on israel now bahrain and
the united arab emirates and had
normalized ties with israel last year
and this deal was brokered by the
previous uh us administration headed by
donald trump
