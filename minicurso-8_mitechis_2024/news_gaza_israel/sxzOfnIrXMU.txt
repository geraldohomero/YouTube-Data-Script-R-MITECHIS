We join in duplex from Gaza
Valérie Gauriat The Special Envoy
from Euronews Valérie Hello
good thousand the intensity of
bombings do not seem to be dropped
After a day of Sunday that already has
reaches a level of violence without
previous you were witness
how to react civilians
Palestinians trapped in this conflict
How to try to survive daily
So Didier before responding to this
question I don't know if you have
heard the detonations that come from
reasoning behind me it was very
impressive
and bombings have taken up since
a few moments in Gaza we saw
thick scrolls of white smoke and
black rising from the same district of
Gaia who was pounded in the night of
Saturday at Sunday there the bombings
take up the staff who
is at the studio by my side begins to
let me know that you have to speed up
Things about the feelings of
inhabitants there is a lot of frustration
a lot of anger we made a
tour at the market this morning there was
world but less than usual at us
we say and people are content to
survive they no longer live distill
families no longer live children
live the more they lack everything they
lack of food they lack
drugs and above all there is a lack of
freedom in this enclave which is
become a real prison for them and
as many slogans say that
we see everywhere in the street at
Gaza Valérie with a balance sheet that
of an hour what is the situation
in the landlocked hospitals then
clearly the situation in
hospitals is completely saturated we
visited the Daichi Fayer hospital which
is the main hospital in Gaza and there
There was a crazy world outside a lot
people inside doctors on
The exhausted who exhausted exasperated
Certainly there is also a lack of
medication means and we can
expect the situation
that worse today after the
bombings that we have just attended
Valérie Gauriat Special Envoy
