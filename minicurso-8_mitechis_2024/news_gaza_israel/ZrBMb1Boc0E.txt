VISIT HIS COUNTRY. THE HAMAS
TERROR GROUP LAUNCHED A
LARGE-SCALE ATTACK LAST
SATURDAY THAT HAS KILLED
SIDES. GETTING A FLIGHT OUT OF
ISRAEL HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE
SINCE THE CONFLICT BEGAN. SOME
LOCAL FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO
RETURN HOME TO THE TRI-STATE
AREA. JOHN DIAS JOINS US LIVE
FROM NEWARK AIRPORT, WERE
SEVERAL FLIGHTS FROM TEL AVIV
ARRIVED OVER THE WEEKEND.
YOU. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF
EMOTIONS AT THE AIRPORT THIS
MORNING. SO MANY AMERICANS ARE
OVERJOYED THAT THEY ARE BACK
SAFELY. THEY ARE OUT OF HARMS
WAY. A FEW HOURS FROM NOW, A
THIRD FLIGHT FROM TEL AVIV WILL
ARRIVE AT NEWARK LIBERTY
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. EARLIER
THIS MORNING, TWO FLIGHTS
CARRYING DOZENS OF TRAVELERS
LANDED AT THIS AIRPORT. THESE
TRAVELERS TELL US THAT THEY
HAD NO ISSUES, BUT SO MANY
OTHERS ARE DEALING WITH
HEADACHES. FINDING A FLIGHT OUT
OF ISRAEL CONTINUES TO BE A
STRUGGLE MAJOR U.S. AIRPORTS
ARE SUSPENDING DIRECT FLIGHTS
TO AND FROM ISRAEL FOR THE
NEAR FUTURE. MOST PEOPLE WE
SPOKE WITH ARE THANKFUL TO BE
BACK IN AMERICA AND SAFE. SOME
TELL ME THEY HAVE SOME
I DON'T HAVE THE WORDS. I
HAVE TO COME BACK. I HAVE THREE
FRIENDS THAT I LOST. I HAVE
BEEN TO THREE FUNERALS, ONE
AFTER THE OTHER. YOU JUST CAN'T
IMAGINE . YOU SEE FAMILIES
LOSING THEIR KIDS.
I HAVE SEVEN OTHER SIBLINGS IN
ISRAEL. I HAVE FRIENDS I KNOW
IN THE ARMY. I KNOW THEY GOT
KILLED.
Reporter: THE STATE
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ARRANGING
CHARTER FLIGHTS FOR U.S.
CITIZENS OUT OF ISRAEL TO OTHER
COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, SINCE SO
MANY DIRECT FLIGHTS CONTINUE TO
GET CANCELED. A LOT OF
TRAVELERS WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING
WITH HAVE TOLD US THAT THERE
SAID ABOUT THE THOUGHT THAT
THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN EXACTLY
THEY WILL BE RETURNING BACK TO
ISRAEL. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY
GET BACK OVER THERE OR WHAT IT
