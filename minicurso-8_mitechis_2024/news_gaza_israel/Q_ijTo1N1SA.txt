chaos unconfrontation inside the al-aqsa
mosque compound
as israeli police fire stun grenades to
disperse muslim worshipers
around 20 past seven all of a sudden a
huge force of police
attacked muslim worshipers who were
inside the mosque
it was a brutal attack on worshippers uh
simply because
the israeli police do not want such
strong presence
inside the master as part of their plans
and schemes
the police also fired tear gas and
rubber bullets at palestinian protesters
they say they responded after stones
bottles and fireworks were thrown at
them
al-qud's day also known as jerusalem day
falls on the last friday of the fasting
month
of ramadan the annual event is a protest
against israel's rule of jerusalem
there is an attempt not only to apply
time division at al-aqsa mosque but also
to divide al-aqsa mosque physically
this should not be done we must work to
prevent it
and the vigilantes are defending the
mosque on behalf of the arab nation
and the islamic nation
[Applause]
earlier on friday thousands of muslim
worshippers had answered the call from
the islamic wax
the trust that operates the compound
under the authority of jordan
to pray in and around al-aqsa
the compound is a constant point of
contention in the palestinian-israeli
conflict
but tensions in occupied east jerusalem
have increased in recent weeks
as palestinians have protested against
israeli restrictions on access to parts
of the city during ramadan
and there's been unrest over an israeli
court order
to evict palestinian families in the
sheikh jarrah neighborhood
demonstrators tried to enter the
neighborhood on friday but soldiers used
sound bombs against the crowd and closed
all entrances to the area
the united nations has warned the forced
evictions could amount to war crimes
this is a particularly sensitive moment
and
uh it was it was predictable and
especially when
israeli forces are using such uh
such violent tactics that seem
you know that are disproportionate
firing uh
percussion grenades and rubber bullets
at
unarmed protesters
the u.s says it's deeply concerned about
the heightened tensions and called on
all sides to work to de-escalate them
regional countries such as turkey and
qatar have condemned friday's actions by
israeli security forces
as an attack on human rights victoria
