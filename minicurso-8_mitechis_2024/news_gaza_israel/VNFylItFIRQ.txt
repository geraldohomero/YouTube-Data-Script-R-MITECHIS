we discussed in detail our efforts to
prevent any actor state or non-state
from creating a new front uh in this
conflict we're also working intensively
together to secure the release of
hostages including American citizens
being held by Hamas and Gaza I'm
grateful for the urgency that cter is
bringing to this
effort I had an opportunity to meet
yesterday with the families of some of
those being held hostage by Hamas
their anguish is
profound they're desperate to bring
their loved ones home and we are working
urgently on that effort as Israel
continues to respond to hamas's
devastating attacks the United States
will ensure that it has what it needs to
defend its people Secretary of Defense
Austin was in Israel today doing just
that working closely with the Israelis
to make sure that we're providing them
what they need and that we'll be able to
do that on an ongoing basis
at the same time we're in constant
communication with Israeli officials and
with multilateral and international
organizations humanitarian organizations
including the United Nations agencies
including the icrc to get Aid to
civilians in Gaza as I said yesterday in
Tel AV Israel has the right indeed it
has the obligation to defend its people
and to try to ensure that Hamas can
never repeat what it's
done we continue to discuss with Israel
the importance of taking every possible
precaution to avoid harming civilians we
recognize that many Palestinian families
in Gaza are suffering through no fault
of their own and the Palestinian
civilians have lost their lives we mourn
the loss of every innocent life Israeli
Palestinian Jew Christian Muslim as well
as civilians of every faith and every
nationality whove been
killed let's not lose sight of why why
this is
happening Israel is conducting
operations in Gaza because Hamas carried
out terrorist attacks that killed in the
most horrific ways 1300 of its
people AAS terrorist slaughtered raped
mutilated tortured burned innocent
civilians from babies to the
elderly men women boys and
girls
