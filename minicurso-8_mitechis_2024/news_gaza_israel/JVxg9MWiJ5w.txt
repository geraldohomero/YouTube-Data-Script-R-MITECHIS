my deep yearning Mr Speaker is for
Israel to one day make peace with our
Palestinian Neighbors
over the years Israel has taken bold
steps towards peace and made
far-reaching proposals to our
Palestinian neighbors however troopies
cannot be anchored in violence
notwithstanding the Deep political
differences and the numerous challenges
that surround the israeli-palestinian
conflict and relations and I do not
ignore them it should be clear that one
cannot talk about peace while condoning
and legitimizing Terror implicitly or
explicitly true peace cannot be anchored
in violence
I'm not oblivious to criticism among
friends including some expressed by
respected members of this house
I respect criticism especially from
Friends although one does not always
have to accept it
but criticism of Israel must not cross
the line into negation of the state of
Israel's right to exist
questioning the Jewish people's right to
self-determination is not legitimate
diplomacy it is anti-Semitism
[Music]
dear friends it's no secret that over
the past few months the Israeli people
have engaged in a heated and painful
debate
we have been immersed in voicing our
differences in revisiting and
renegotiating the balance of our
institutional powers in the absence of a
written constitution in practice the
intense debate going on back home even
as we speak is the clearest tribute to
the fortitude of Israel's democracy
[Music]
Israel's democracy has always been based
on free and fair elections on honoring
the People's Choice on safeguarding
minority rights on protection of human
and civil liberties and on a strong and
independent judiciary
our democracy is also late Friday
afternoon when the sound of them was in
calling to prayer blends with a siren
announcing the Sabbath in Jerusalem
while on the one of the largest and most
impressive
lgbtq Pride parades in the world is
going on in Tel Aviv
