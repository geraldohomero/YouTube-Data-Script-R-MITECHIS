all business activity in the israeli
settlements goes to support an illegal
situation characterized by human rights
violations
amnesty warned major companies pointing
out the human rights violations in the
occupied region
according to the united nations and oecd
guidelines companies do have a social
responsibility in the area of human
rights
let me break it down for you companies
can and should use their influence to
stop or reduce human rights violations
for example those of you who live here
in the uk all know the supermarket chain
co-op
they openly say they won't do business
in illegal israeli territories
now you might say well there's money to
be made and if i don't do business out
there someone else will and you know
what you're absolutely right
if making more money is the objective go
for it but you got to keep in mind that
your company's reputation is at stake
especially nowadays with increased
consumer awareness cancel culture and
active social media waves
remember when everyone was saving ralph
a couple of weeks ago demanding an end
to animal testing so if there can be a
global campaign to ban cosmetic testing
on animals
i'm sure there can also be a campaign
for palestinian human lives
[Applause]
i'm not an attorney but depending on
your involvement as a brand you might
even be held legally responsible for
those violations the un published a list
with 112 companies that do business in
the occupied west bank it's worth
checking out you'll recognize a few
companies that seem to be so woke when
social issues come up
turns out they're not so worried about
human rights violations in that part of
the world
i'm not going to accuse them of having
double standards because it's clearly
more than just that when you're ignoring
un guidelines but then again i guess
nobody really cares about any type of
guidelines when palestinian lives are
mentioned
you
