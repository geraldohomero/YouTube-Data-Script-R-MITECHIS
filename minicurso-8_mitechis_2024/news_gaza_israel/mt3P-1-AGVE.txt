In a dark night, a relief is loaded off the coast of the Gaza district
The ship reveals the appearance.
Openam Sho!Israel Navy!
This ship started from Cyprus on the 12th
On the 15th of the local time, let's go to the coast
I was anchored.
It contains 115 tons of food and water.
After the inspection, it was transferred to 12 trucks and let's go
It is planned to be delivered to the northern region.
A man with a gun is between the crowds.
The Israeli army was waiting for relief supplies on the Gaza district.
Investigating the case where civilians were killed by shooting
I released the video.
Israel is a Palestinian man to civilians
Shooting a gun and the Israeli troops do not shoot
I insisted that I didn't.
In the midst of this, let's go to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
It is said that it has approved the operational plan for the southernmost Rafa area.
Local media reported.
It is also ready to evacuate civilians
I said.
But the date was not clear.
In the Rafa area, about 1.4 million piranians are currently
There is concern about massive civilian damage.
In addition, as it is a channel for the import of relief goods,
There is also a fear that the situation will deteriorate.
We are just that civilians come out of danger
No, it is clear that it can be protected afterwards
You should see the executable plan.
Hamas presented a new ceasefire.
First, after deciding on the withdrawal of the Israeli army,
It is a step -by -step plan to agree on the date.
Health and prisoners are also released in stages.
But the Israeli Prime Minister's Office says it is an unrealistic demand.
I dismissed it.
