BUSINESSMAN, JOSE URIBE, HAS
PLED GUILTY AND HAS AGREED TO
ALL RIGHT, NOW TO OUR OTHER
TOP STORY TONIGHT, ESCALATING
TENSIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
THE OVERNIGHT ISRAEL
LAUNCHING A STRIKE NEAR A MAJOR
AIR BASE AND NUCLEAR SITE IN
SAYING VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED. YEAH.
FOX FIVE SHARON CROWLEY
JOINING US NOW WITH A CLOSER
LOOK AT THE CONFLICT AND WHAT
COULD HAPPEN NEXT. SHARON. YEAH
CHRIS AND TERESA, PRESIDENT
RETALIATE AT ALL.
THE REASON WORLD LEADERS,
INCLUDING THE US, ARE TRYING TO
AVOID ESCALATING TENSIONS IN THE
MIDDLE EAST BY STARTING ANOTHER
INVOLVED IN AN ONGOING WAR
AGAINST HAMAS IN GAZA. ISRAEL,
RETALIATING WITH A SURPRISE
STRIKE COMING AFTER IRAN FIRED
300 MISSILES AND DRONES AT
ISRAEL'S SATURDAY, 99% WERE
SUCCESSFULLY DEFLECTED, A US
OFFICIAL SAYS. ISRAEL HIT NEAR A
MAJOR IRANIAN AIR BASE AND
NUCLEAR SITE ABOUT 200 MILES
SOUTH OF TEHRAN, IRAN STATE
MEDIA SAYS THERE WAS NO DAMAGE
TO THEIR FACILITIES. ISRAEL'S
COUNTERATTACK WAS A LIMITED
MISSILE STRIKE AND DIDN'T
INVOLVE MANNED AIRCRAFT. THE US
WAS NOT INVOLVED BUT WAS
NOTIFIED BEFOREHAND.
THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT
BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY OFFENSIVE
OPERATIONS. OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN
ON, OF COURSE, MAKING SURE THAT
ISRAEL CAN EFFECTIVELY DEFEND
ITSELF, BUT ALSO DE-ESCALATING
TENSIONS.
MEANTIME, IN WASHINGTON, D.C,
A FOREIGN AID PACKAGE CLEARED A
MAJOR PROCEDURAL VOTE, PUTTING
IT ON TRACK FOR A HOUSE VOTE
SATURDAY. BILLIONS ARE SET ASIDE
TO HELP ISRAEL, UKRAINE AND
TAIWAN. UKRAINE PLEADING FOR
RUSSIA.
THE WORLD IS WATCHING. IT IS
TIME FOR CONGRESS TO ACT AND
ACT. WE MUST HARD LINE
REPUBLICANS ARE PUSHING BACK
AGAINST HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE
JOHNSON AND THE $95 BILLION
PACKAGE.
THEY SAY THE MONEY SHOULDN'T
BE SENT OVERSEAS WITHOUT DEALING
WITH THE CRISIS AT AMERICA'S
NOW WE'RE ON THE FLOOR UNDER
A RULE TO GIVE ANOTHER $100
BILLION TO FUND WAR UNPAID FOR
WITH ZERO BORDER SECURITY THAT
HE'S SERVING UKRAINE FIRST IN
AMERICA LAST.
WELL MOST OF WHAT IS IN THAT
PACKAGE THAT FOREIGN IS FOREIGN
AID. BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES A
SOLD BY ITS CHINA BASED OWNER OR
BE BANNED IN THE US BECAUSE OF
SECURITY CONCERNS. THAT'S, OF
COURSE, A VERY CONTROVERSIAL
ISSUE. THE HOUSE IS SET TO VOTE
ON THAT PACKAGE TOMORROW. CHRIS
