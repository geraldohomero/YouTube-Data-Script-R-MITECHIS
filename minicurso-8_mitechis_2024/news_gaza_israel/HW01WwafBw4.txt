meanwhile scientists have created the
world's first synthetic embryos a
groundbreaking feat that has now negated
the need for sperm eggs and their
fertilization the scientists at the
wiesman institute in the state of israel
found that stem cells from mice could in
fact be made into into self-assembling
embryotic structure now these structures
have an intestinal tract the beginnings
of a brain and also a beating heart
researchers believe that the work would
in fact reduce animal experimentation in
future and pave the way for new sources
of cells and tissues for human
transplantation
we'll be focusing on taking stem cells
skin cells from a patient let's say i'm
a patient i need a liver cells and take
a biopsy
make stem cells in the dish
grow them in special condition and put
them in this device for about
20 days and they will make organized
structure which we call synthetic
embryos
and these they have cell progenitors
including liver progenitors or blood
progenitors and we can take these cells
maybe and transplant them back to the
patient
the synthetic embryos are anticipated to
advance our understanding of how organs
and tissues develop throughout the
growth of our natural embryos in the
near future
last year the same team had in fact
built an artificial womb that let
natural mouse embryos grow outside the
uterus for several days
now the same device has been used to
nurture the mouse stem cells for more
than a week that is nearly half the
gestation period for a mouse
the internal structure and also the cell
genetic profiles of the synthetic mouse
embryos were 95 identical to those
of real mouse embryos
the scientists could of course tell that
the developing organs were useful while
this breakthrough is remarkable the
united kingdom's human
fertilization and embryology act does
not apply to the manufacture of
synthetic human embryos and the not
considered permitted embryos using them
to induce pregnancy in a woman would be
illegal
