regional and international to fight
against terrorist groups that
threaten
Everyone I think it's interest
of Israel of its safety that also of
several of your neighbors threatened by these
same groups or groups
neighbors the struggle must be merciless
but not without
rule because we are democracies
who fight against
terrorists of E therefore who respects the
right of war and provides access
humanitarian aid of democracies that
do not target civilians or
Gaza ni nowhere
populations impose in
the occurrence of allowing access to
the help of restoring and we have
long spoke very
detail to restore electricity to
hospitals for patients and
injured without this electricity being able to
be used to wage war and
We are going to build very
concrete on this subject in all
next days we are ready to
provide concrete aid to all
populations as we did these
last years in recent months but
with very practical solutions and
concrete that we discussed during
This interview also ready to do so in
committing us with the main
neighbors to build his
solutions this struggle we also owe
Drive it by taking care to avoid
the conflagration of the whole region I put
Here in guard the hzbollah the diet
Iranian tools in Yemen and
all the factions that in the
region threatens Israel not to take
the reckless risk of opening
new fronts would be to open the
relate to a regional conflagration of which
Everyone would come out

necessity for all peoples of the
region let's do everything
so as not to add tears to tears
and blood at
blood closer to here I also want

Acts of a few to the guards
Palestinian civilians whose violence
threatens to spread fire to
Sis-Jordania also the stability of
region the return to standardization which
announced that it will only be guaranteed if the
response from Israel to violence is
obviously safe and relentless
facing the terrorist groups but also
policy by accepting legitimate law
Palestinians to have a
territory and a state in peace and
security alongside Israel because it
will have integrated existence and security
of Israel as a condition
first
