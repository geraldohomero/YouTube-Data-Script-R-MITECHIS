Life a young girl is found injured but
alive she was one of many children in
the home in the alaur area when it was
destroyed by Israeli strike on a
neighboring
mosque they have targeted the mosque
there are other people in the house this
is my
daughter like countless other children
in Gaza this wasn't the first time this
young girl had been injured in an
Israeli
strike I wanted to send her and part of
my family to Egypt for treatment because
I've got a permit to go to Egypt since
they were injured they were targeted
before thousands of displaced
Palestinians have been Sheltering in and
around mosques and Gaza since the War
Began but Israel has continually
targeted them destroying hundreds across
the strip in the last 6 months often
killing those who had hoped to find
safety Alex beard Al

their
impact sure the Israeli forces targeted
Alura MOS yesterday night and that R
resulted one killed and injured 11

incident of its kind this is a policy
imposed upon the Palestinians here there
are more than 600 mosques who which have
been destroyed by the Israelis during
this
war and uh this is not the first
incident as I told you the uh the
Israeli forces in the same context the

Palestinians there and they
besieged AWA school and forced women to
