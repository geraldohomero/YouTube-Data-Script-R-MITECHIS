and she said yeah she'll be here in a
couple of minutes I'm like wow don't
believe it
and all of a sudden the the door opened
up and she just
ran it was um was beautiful just like
in just like I imagined it you know
running together um I squeezed I
probably squeezed too hard and um so
only when she stepped back a little I
could see her her face was chiseled like
mine whereas before she left it was you
know chubby girly young kid face yeah
she's lost a lot of um body
weight
um and the color she I've never seen her
so white the the other and the
most shocking disturbing part of meeting
was
um she was just
Whispering
good I had to put my ear on her lips
like this close and say what did you say
and I thought you were
kidnapped and she said I thought you
were kidnapped she thought I was in
captivity they thought they'd kidnapped
me she didn't know what the hell
happened to
that
morning so she's presumed everyone's
kidnapped or killed or slaughtered or
she had no
idea does Emily understand what happened
on October
7th
yeah yeah yep unfortunately she does
um how do you tell
her you know your second m is dead
killed shot
when we got back to the hospital I asked
the psychiatrists you know what do I do
what should I what should I do she said
you've just got to tell her straight
it's the best
way
okay yeah that was that was very hard
cuz we we told her and you know her
little eyes glazed up and she just went
took a sharp sharp in and take a
breath terrible thing to tell a child
but um as they recommend that you have
to close the book sounds cruel but you
have to stop that
hope so you you've got to stop that it
has to be final now kiss is
dead
