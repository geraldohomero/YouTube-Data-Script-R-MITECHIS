For the last two weeks, you have been fighting a river
In 13, the hospital was in great trouble
You're on it Maternity's mission is according to
There were a lot of terrorists in the maternity ward
First we collapsed into all the citizens who felt under the building
And out We have hundreds of civilians, women and children
They were also terrorists who hid behind them after all
P.A. operations we went for selective scans
In the maternity ward We found Rim weapons
Many used by the enemy and were also installed in several
Terrorists who opened fire on us were eliminated
Instead of us The soldier went to the hospital
We're in the department right now
We had two run-ins with terrorists
Inside the department The girls took them out. We found plenty
A lot of these and other media outlets
Expressed within
The walls inside the acoustic ceiling inside of Cariot's.
Sick beds inside the sick deaths themselves we found
Lots of gun sniper weapons
And a lot more ammo keeps scanning here

Almost an enemy
It’s been a very good two weeks and it’s something I do
I'll tell you to plan a war to get it out
In a war to commit The same is true in war
Very complex achievements are very achievements
High is the realization of a devious idea
Which is very much Impressive. There's a very, very good message here
A hospital is not a safe place for us
They do everything not to harm patients. No. Hurt
The medical staff, by the way, does not have this operation
One medical staff member who was injured has no patients
Injured and there are many A lot of people who have been killed
Very terrorists who were captured is a very, very level of fighting
Very high A, so far
Very high and I'm telling you no one can
To roll back such a large number of terrorists
Detained so much of dead terrorists
So many executives and beds of an idea that we are
We could be in a place where the operation won't touch us
This one This operation did not end and achieved its goal
He's on a very high level and this operation
Keep doing
thoroughly until they are informed

That we're done
