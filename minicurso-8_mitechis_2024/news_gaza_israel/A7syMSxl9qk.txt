 
VERIFY THIS INFORMATION. 
TROOPS ARE CONTINUING TO SEARCH 
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL 
COMPLEX. 
>>> A NATIONAL SECURITY 
REPORTER FROM THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL JOINING US NOW FROM 
WASHINGTON, WARREN, THE U.S. 
HAS BACKED ISRAEL'S CLAIMS THAT 
AL-SHIFA WAS USED  AS A HAMAS 
COMMAND CENTER. 
WHAT EVIDENCE HAVE THEY 
DEMONSTRATED TO SUPPORT THOSE 
CLAIMS? 
>> THE WHITE HOUSE DECLASSIFIED 
INTELLIGENCE. 
THEY DIDN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT IT. 
WE WERE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHAT 
WAS BEHIND THAT CLAIM AND IT 
WAS BASED ON SIGNALS 
INTELLIGENCE. 
THAT IS INTERCEPTED 
COMMUNICATIONS FROM HAMAS 
FIGHTERS AND OTHER INTELLIGENE.
THE U.S. HAS HIGH CONFIDENCE 
THAT HAMAS AND ANOTHER GROUP 
HAS USED THE HOSPITAL AS A 
COMMAND CONTROL. 
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, WARREN? 
DO OFFICIALS HAVE AN IDEA OF 
THE SIZE AND SCOPE HERE? 
>> AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, THEY 
DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE DETAILS 
OF THE ALLEGED HAMAS OPERATIONS 
UNDERNEATH THE HOSPITAL. 
ISRAEL IS STILL STRUGGLING TO 
SHOW PROOF OF ITS CONTENTION. 
THEY ANNOUNCED TODAY THEY HAVE 
FOUND A SHAFT LEADING TO A 
TUNNEL UNDER THE HOSPITAL AND 
ARE CONTINUING TO SCOUR THE SITE
. IN THE COMING DAYS, WE WILL 
LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF 
ISRAEL'S CLAIM IT WAS A 
LEGITIMATE MILITARY OPERATION 
AND MILITARY TARGETS. 
>> WARREN, THERE IS 
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT THE 
OPERATION AT AL-SHIFA TO BEGIN 
WITH. 
IS THERE ADDITIONAL  
INTELLIGENCE ABOUT ISRAEL'S 
POSITION IN THE REGION? 
>> YOU KNOW, NOT AT THIS POINT 
BUT AL-SHIFA IS THE LARGEST 
HOSPITAL IN THE GAZA STRIP . 
MEDICAL AUTHORITIES SAID OVER 
11,000 HAVE DIED. MANY OF THEM 
CIVILIANS SINCE THE OPERATION 
GOT UNDERWAY. 
YEAH, WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE 
MUCH OF THE PUBLIC OPINION IS 
SKEPTICAL TO SAY THE LEAST OF 
ISRAEL AND OF THE OPERATION AND 
THEY WILL HAVE TO SHOW CONCRETE 
PROOF TO EVEN BEGIN TO PUT 
THOSE CLAIMS TO REST. 
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU HAVE THE 
U.S. BACKING ISRAEL'S VIE
