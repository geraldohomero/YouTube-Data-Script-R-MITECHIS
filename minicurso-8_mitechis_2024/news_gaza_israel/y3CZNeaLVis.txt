yes
208 abstention 13 and no six then the
resolution is adopted by the
[Applause]
council according to the resolution
before you today Israel has no right to
protect its people while Hamas has every
right to murder and torture innocent
Israelis Israel should have stood idly
by on October 7th as Hamas Unleashed its
barbaric acts on October 8th it should
have allowed Hamas to do so again
according to this resolution States
should not sell arms to Israel in its
Endeavor to defend its population but
they can continue to arm
Hamas
pH
responsility
St respons the United States has
repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict
military operations against Hamas with
humanitarian operations in order to
avoid civilian casualties and to ensure
humanitarian actors can carry out their
essential mission in safety that has not
happened and in just 6 months more
humanitarians have been killed in this
conflict than in any War of the modern
[Music]
era it's good what's happened that we
got we have 28 votes in favor but I'm
not happy with some of the European
countries that they voted against and
those who voted obain it was an
opportunity for all to correct what they
did since 7th October until
now the human rights of
Israelis must be ensured as well we are
no different we deserve no
less this Council has long abandoned
reason and it has long abandoned the
human rights of Israelis and Jews and
today's
vote was a very dark day in the history
of this Council and also also at the
United
Nation this resolution is a stain on the
Human Rights Council there's no other
way to look at it is a stain on the
Human Rights Council and the United
Nation as a
whole I'm not going to attend the rest
of the session today as you know there
will be other deliberations and other
resolutions against us but I see no
point I can no longer sit in a
room which is so-called Human Rights
Council and that they cannot even bring
them eles to uh condemn the atrocities
and the massacre of October
7th
