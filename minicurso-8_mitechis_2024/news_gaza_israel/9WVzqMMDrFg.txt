THANK YOU. 
>>> NORAH O'DONNELL SPOKE WITH 
AN AMERICAN TOURIST CAUGHT IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE FIGHTING. 
>> Reporter: THIS IS WHAT IT'S 
LIKE TO BE IN A COUNTRY UNDER 
ATTACK. 
AIR RAID SIRENS BLARE. 
THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE IRON 
DOME INTERCETING A ROCKET. 
IT'S A SCRAMBLE TO SAFETY INTO 
A SHELTER DOWNSTAIRS QUICKLY. 
PEOPLE CHECKING IN WITH THEIR 
LOVED ONES AND WAITING. 
IT'S JUST ABOUT 3:30 IN ISRAEL. 
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SIRENS THAT 
HAVE SOUNDED IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES. 
WE ARE EMERGING FROM THE 
STAIRCASE BUT WE HAVE GOTTEN 
THE ALL CLEAR.

ARE VERY HOLOCAUST-LIKE. 
>> YOUR GRANDMOTHER SURVIVED 
THE HOLOCAUST AND CAME TO WORK 
AT THIS HOSPITAL. 
>> I KNOW SHE WOULD BE PROUD TO 
SEE ME HERE. 
YEAH. 
>> SHE REALLY ANSWERED THE 
CALL. 
I HAVE TO ASSUME YOU'RE SEEING 
OTHER STORIES OF HEROISM. 
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. 
AND MICHELLE WAS SUPPOSED TO 
RETURN BACK TO NEW YORK CITY ON 
THE UPPER EAST SIDE, BUT SHE 
SAYS SHE MAY ACTUALLY STAY HERE 
IN ISRAEL AND CONTINUE TO HELP 
PEOPLE. 
AT THE SAME HOSPITAL, YOU SHOW 
UP, THE LINE IS SO LONG FOR 
PEOPLE WANTING TO DONATE BLOOD. 
AREAS WHERE THEY ARE UNLOADING 
DONATIONS TO HELP THOSE FLEEING
