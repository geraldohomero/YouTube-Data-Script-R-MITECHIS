Apparently they would be healthy
They were transferred IM immediately
to the Cheba hospital which is a hospital
which is located in the suburbs of
teavive about 70 km from the band of
Gaza The operation took place in the middle of
At night it is an operation that was
led by a commando unit of the army
Israeli but in close
collaboration with the services of
Israeli information visibly
It was an operation that was prepared
for several days since the
Israeli services had had
information that hostages
were not under the tunnels
as we sometimes imagine it but in the second
floor of a Rafa building in the suburbs
On the border sorry with Egypt
It is therefore in this building that are
intervened the special forces
Israeli to release both
hostages according to information transmitted
This morning by the Israeli army the
soldiers would have protected their bodies
the hostages during their evacuation in order to
whether it was not injured or killed by
shots and they then immediately
been given to the civil authorities and therefore
Transferred to the hospital in the suburbs
of Télaviv Stéphane is therefore a
floor operation led by commandos
of the Israeli army in this sector
of rafa we remind you it is everything in the south
of the Gaza Strip all this is
intervened after a series of
bombardment
Israeli offensive started on
place
Yes very clearly since the modus
opera is exactly like that of
north of the Gaza Strip and that more
recently from Hanannes to the south of the
strip of Gaza, that is to say that there is
first massive bombing like
It was the case that night and then and
Good infantry between step by step
almost house by house in the
territory to dismantle groups
Armed with Hamas the Israeli army
claims to have dem most of the
Hamas battalions but there would
two that would be in Rafar
precisely on the Egyptian border and
then there is of course obviously this
objective that is to release the hostages
Israelis not this time by
negotiation but by operations your
that the one we could see tonight and
The Israeli government has repeated it
is out of the question to stop
now military operations
since Rafar is in a way the
last step the last bastion of
Hamas according to the Israeli army
