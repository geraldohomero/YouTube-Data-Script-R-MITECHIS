demand prime minister netanyahu's
resignation over the alleged
corruption scandals and mishandling of
the pandemic

12 years in israel
and the leader hopes to retain his seat
in the tuesday

benjamin netanyahu is the first israeli
prime minister to be indicted in office
for corruption and bribery however
netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing

have been going on since
april 2019 but the winning parties have
failed to form
a stable government in israel experts
say that
netanyahu's liquid party is once again
likely to emerge as the biggest player
but opinion polls have
not suggested a clear winner yet
