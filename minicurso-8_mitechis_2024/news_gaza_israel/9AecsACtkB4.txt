white house is on lockdown the american
president donald trump was in the middle
of a news conference
when he was pulled out by a secret
service agent
take a look at this kids hopefully soon
excuse me
so we don't know why the president was
pulled out but apparently the news
conference which ended moments ago has
now resumed let's go take a look at that
uh just told me when he came up you
pretty much saw it like i did he said
sir could you please come with me
so you were surprised i was surprised
also i think it's probably pretty
unusual
but uh very very professional people
that do a fantastic job as you know
so it seems to me it seems to be from
what i was said there was
a shooting it was law enforcement
shot someone seems to be the suspect and
the suspect is now on the way to the
hospital
i can't tell you the condition of the
suspect
there was nobody else injured there was
no other law enforcement injured
and i just wanna i will get on to the
press conference but
i i do want to thank secret service they
are fantastic the job they do
uh from what i understand the answer is
yes
that's what i understand i don't know
you'll have to ask me
they'll have a detailed maybe a briefing
for you outside
later i don't know i didn't ask that
question
it might not have had anything to do
with me it might have been something
else but
it was on the outside of the premises
the wall the
the as you know the fencing especially
the new fencing that they put up is
very powerful but it was on the outside
of the white house
okay and they'll have a full report
secret service
in a little while we'll have a full
report
do i seem rattled it's uh unfortunate
that this is
a world but the world's always been
a dangerous place it's not something
that's unique
the world has been you look back over
the
centuries the world has been a dangerous
place very dangerous place and
it will continue i guess for a period of
does this make you think time about your
personal safety inside the white house
no i feel very safe with uh
secret service they're fantastic people
they're the best of the best
