the fate of the occupied west bank has
represented a running soar in relations
between israel and the palestinians for
decades
but a renewed pledge by the israeli
prime minister to finally annex it has
alarmed the international community
addressing the security council online
the un middle east peace envoy warned
that such a move would wreck any
remaining chances of a peace settlement
the continuing threat of annexation by
israel of parts of the west bank would
constitute a most serious violation of
international law deal a devastating
blow to the two-state solution
close the daughter a renewal of
negotiations and threaten efforts to
advance regional peace in our broader
efforts to maintain international peace
and security
israel has been emboldened by support
from the united states
the trump administration has published
its own peace plan for the region which
recognizes israel's sovereignty over
illegal israeli settlements in the west
bank
the u.s ambassador to the u.n said the
conflict could only be resolved through
negotiation
if both sides are serious about their
talking
it is time for both sides to prove it
and if this council is serious about
wanting to see progress in the middle
east
then i urge each of you to look
seriously at the steps you can take to
encourage direct negotiations
but the palestinians say they've been
left with no alternative but to end all
security agreements
it cannot escape the need
for taking these measures
including total and complete
cancellation of the security
coordination which all palestinians
wanted to end long time ago israel's
ambassador to the un said his country is
prepared to sit down with the
palestinians for direct talks
that prospect however looks more
unlikely by the day john brain trt world
