outrage where is the revulsion where is
the rejection where is the explicit
condemnation of these

this entire body could or would tolerate
the slaughter of its
people let's not forget that among the
more than 1,400 people that Hamas killed
on October 7 were citizens from more
than 30 UN member States including many
of the members around this very table
the victims included at least 33
American
citizens every one of us has a stake
every one of us has a responsibility in
defeating
terrorism Palestinian civilians must be
protected we continue to coordinate
closely with Egypt Israel and partners
across the region as well as with the
United Nations to build mechanisms that
will enable sustained humanitarian
assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza
without benefiting Hamas or any other
terrorist
group President Biden appointed one of
our most senior diplomats Ambassador
David saterfield to lead our
humanitarian efforts which he is
currently doing on the
ground whether they're carried out by
ISIS their loved ones must be released
immediately unconditionally and every
member of this Council indeed every
member of this body should insist on

that we're grateful to cter to Egypt to
the is CRC for helping secure the
release of four of hamasa
hostages but at least 200 more and again

the grip of
Hamas we're all determined to prevent
this conflict from
spreading to that end we call on all
member states to send a firm United
message to any state or non-state actor

widen but if Iran or its proxies attack
