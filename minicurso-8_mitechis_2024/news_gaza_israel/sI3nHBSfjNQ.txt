Although clashes between
Israel and they never occur frequently
Several of this Saturday
They make a difference previously the
journalist and expert in the Middle East
Mikel all will give us this
ANALYSIS This type of situation
We clearly know when a
War but it is very difficult to know when
The current scenario will end is the
massive bombings by Israel
that will seek to kill a high leader
ever and surely they will leave many
Dead civilians from Gaza are going to continue
With the launch of rockets and never
also ensures that you have more prepared
surprises the most radical sectors and
Not so radicals ask for an operation
large -scale land and return to
occupy the strip what happens is that
Israel now knows that he never has
dozens of captive civilians and military
who will want to use in the future negotiation
And this is a huge pressure for the
Benjamín Netanyahu government now is
who marks the step is not Israel and
as we have said in this type of
situations we know very clearly how
He has started who has started it in this
case has ever been the one who has launched this
Operation by land sea and air without
what we do not know is when
nor how it will
Finish and we also ask Mikel
They will help the vulnerability shown
by Israel today and what
means for the course of
conflict the question we ask ourselves
all especially Israelis in these
moments is how the
analysts have baptized this day as
The 11s of Israel and criticize the huge in
The security system we are talking about
of a country that has invested millions in
The gaza barrier and the system
antimisiles have ears and weapons in
Every corner of the 42 km of this fence
of separation and the truth is that today no
His drones has worked at all
They are also omnipresent in the strip
But today none of that has worked
many unanswered questions that
Benjamí Nanau and his government must
Clarify citizens on this day that
The story of this conflict will happen
as one of the most black days in the
History of Israel eh a state that is
known as the state of security
Today he has undoubtedly had a failure without
precedents
