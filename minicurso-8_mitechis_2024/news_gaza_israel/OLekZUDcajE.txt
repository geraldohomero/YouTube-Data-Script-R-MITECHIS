US Secretary of State Anthony
Blinken met this Sunday in Riad
The Saudi leader MBS who suspended
Yesterday his discussions on a possible
normalization with Israel he called
Anthony Blinken China use her
Influence to appease the situation
Antoine Mariootti you are our old
corresponding to Jerusalem Anthony
Blinen he is waiting for China he
Wait for it to get involved as it
try to involve all the countries of the
region that does not necessarily have all
the same allies the same relationships
whether with Israel with Hamas the
China has an important relationship with
Iran for years is
besides a little that allowed
Iran to hold on when there have been
very important economic sanctions
before the nuclear agreement of
2015 and which suddenly is kept a place
important, especially since
Western
unilaterally the United States so if
You want it is a
a little reliable partner in the eyes of
Iran and in the eyes of the Iranians therefore
obviously knowing that China has
also very correct relationships
with Israel and very very involved
economically there is a lot of market
economically right now
besides in Israel therefore necessarily
It's also one of those rare
who speak a little bit to two and who
get along well with both so more
you have international pressure from
all part towards the two actors of this
conflict whether it is the the Hamas block
and his Iran support because few
world speaks directly Hamas or Israel
The faster we may arrive or in
Any case we can try to do
fall a little uh the violence tried
to find solutions for hostages
and try to find solutions
For civilian populations that
Obviously you know are in
first line therefore especially for
negotiate humanitarian corridors
So on the ground
