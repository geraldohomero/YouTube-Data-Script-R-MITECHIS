it's clear that the conflict will move
and needs to move to a lower intensity
phase um and
and we expect to
see and want to see uh a shift to more
targeted
operations uh with a smaller number of
forces that's really focused in on
dealing with the the
leadership of Hamas uh the tunnel
Network and a few other critical things
um and as that
happens I think you'll see as well um
the
the uh harm done to uh to civilians also
decrease uh
significantly uh we've said all along
and we have these conversations almost
every day that um it is vitally
important how Israel conduct conducts
its operations again with a focus on
protecting civilians minimizing harm to
them maximizing assistance getting to
them
and what is striking to me is that even
as again we hear uh many countries
urging the end to uh this conflict which
we would all like to see I hear
virtually no one saying demanding of
Hamas that it stop hiding behind
civilians that it lay down its arms that
it
