Against the Palestinian Islamist group
Never in the Gaza Israel strip affirms

New Israeli attack to the camp of
Almasi refugees in the center of
Gaza most of the place has remained
reduced to debris under which
There are still trapped people
Many tried to flee from
bombing told us that we went to
Rafag but we don't want what we are going to do
There living in the
Street here they have evacuated the whole
neighborhood many of those who leave their
homes in search of refuge end in
improvised camps crowded and
No running water in which the day to
day is fighting for
Survival enough of war enough of
pain enough hunger and harm
We are tired of living we grow from
more basic it is difficult for us to make bread
And wash clothes we have to bring water
To drink and to wash we are all
suffering we need hygienic towels
For women there are none and
We have to wait in long lines
As resources run out of
food prices
The Agency for Refugees of the
UN warned that 40% of Gazatí
They run at risk of suffering
hungry some cannot buy or
even canned food by
prices that have risen up to 10 times

It doesn't matter where the Catí
They claim that their lives are continuous
danger if bombings do not kill them
They fear that hunger or
diseases
