The Israeli government under pressure
Saturday evening hundreds of
demonstrators were gathered in front of
the parliament in Jerusalem and alle to
Long live to ask for the release of
hostages and the departure of the Prime Minister
I believe the Prime Minister has
lost that he does not take care of bringing back
the hostages he does other things that
have nothing to do with the failure of 7
October I demand that Netanahou is coming back
at his place that he leaves us alone
so that we can direct the country
and that someone else brings my son back
Matan and the rest
Benjamin Netanahou had given the day before
its green light again to speak
with Hamas in Egypt and at
Qatar according to the Reuters agency this new
negotiation cycle would be based on a
suspension of the Israeli offensive at
6 -week Gaza and the release of
40 of the 130 hostages always in the hand of
Hamas in exchange for the release of
Several hundred prisoners
Palestinians however since the truce
a week last November the
discussion skate around points
precise last week again the
exposed failed after the request
of Hamas of the total withdrawal of troops
Israeli in the Gaza Strip and the
release of all prisoners
Palestinians detained by Israel a
asks that the Hebrew state had qualified
of unrealizable Israel refuses everything
Permanent withdrawal of his Gaza troops
and to want to destroy the
Hamas but this time the pressure
international is becoming more and more
strong
For the first time in almost 6 months
conflict the Security Council of
The UN adopted a resolution claiming
A CC immediate fire in the band of
Gaza for the duration of Ramadan and the
release of all the hostages selected
by Hamas a setback for Israel
since the American ally has abstained
to vote to allow the adoption of
this
resolution
