humanitarian crisis in
Gaza innocent Palestinian families and a
vast majority of nothing to do with
theas they're being used as human
Shields yesterday I spoke for over an
hour the family member of those
Americans who were still on counter for
and a zoom
call they've endured an Agony of not
knowing what's
happened not the same thing but I can
tell you what it's love
it's one thing to lose someone you know
you're going to lose and be there with
them and hold their hands like I was
able to do with my son it's a very other
thing to get a phone call I got years
ago saying there's been an
accident your wife and daughter are dead
I'm not
sure your boys are going to make
it the
uncertainty of those two or three hours
trying to get back to find
out it's the worst feeling in the world
it's cut
wrenching and it's yet another reminder
that hate never goes
away you cannot be silent silence is
complicity silence is
complicity
folks we're the United States of America
and there's nothing beyond our capacity
when we do it together nothing nothing
nothing so let's stand together and get
everyone else on the deal history is T
us again and
again anti-Semitism
islamophobia homophobia transphobia
they're all
connected hate toward one group left
unanswered opens the door for more hate
toward more groups more often
readily week ago we saw hate manifested
another way in the worst massacre of
Jewish people since the Holocaust more
than 1,300 innocence lives lost in
Israel including at least 27 Americans
children and grandparents alike
kidnapped held hostage by Hamas
humanitarian crisis in
Gaza innocent Palestinian families and a
vast majority have nothing to do with
Hamas they're being used as human
shield all of you here tonight and all
the avocat and allies across the country
I see the light that's going to triumph
over the darkness I see see the hope
that's going to conquer fear I see the
love that's going to overcome hate in
all its forms I see a great nation
because we're basically a good people we
just remember who we are and we're not
the victim and although we're good folks
we got to stand up and holler we got to
stand up and holler you cannot be silent
silence is
complicity silence is
complicity
