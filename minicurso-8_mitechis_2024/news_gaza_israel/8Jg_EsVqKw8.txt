We now make contact with Nuria Garrido
sent from n mass to the area of the
conflict nuria how things are going
Good afternoon for
How about Daniel Enrique very good
Afternoons, I find myself right now in
Bank a region where tension
Also in the last week it has
increased but undoubtedly the
News this Monday is that tanks
Israelis are approaching much more to
the city of Gaza and is that this end of
Week already launched a very hard offensive
With armored infantry with drones that
They already suggested that this invasion was going to
reach a more point one more point
critic and this Monday effectively
that we are knowing at least since
Here is that the tanks eh of the army
Israelí are approaching are very
near the city of Gaza is
important to remember that journalists
international and the Israelis no
We can go to the Palestinian enclave to
teach what is happening there that
Our eyes are the gazatí companions
But as explained the situation there is
dramatic the UN says that Israel has
state bombing near hospitals
and of medical centers specifically of the
Alcu hospital where there are 400 patients in
critical status and more than 14,000 people
that they are taking refuge there what is
Of course this situation is going to
sharpen as hours spend
less this weekend the first
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already said that
This will be a long and difficult war that
It is a kind of vital mission and that
For them it is like their second war of
independence and want to end
With ever another important topic
as commented on the theme of the reins
Recall that there are more than 200 reins in
The Gaza Strip here in Israel there is
There has been a lot of concern
Even this weekend has also
there have been protests against war
And asking to end the fire cease
that is being produced in the trench of
Gaza very close to Ramala that is like the
capital of Deis Jordan here too
have produced operations and
clashes between the army
Israeli and some Palestinians and in
definitive very a very
complicated here and a war that without
Doubt will change the meaning of the East
Half thank you nuria thank you very much
The
time
