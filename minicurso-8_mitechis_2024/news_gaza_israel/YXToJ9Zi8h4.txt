>> Lawrence: FOX NEWS ALERT.
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SAYS HAMAS 
TERRORISTS ARE BEGINNING TO GIVE
UP THEIR FIGHT.
>> Brian: TREY YINGST HAS THE 
LATEST.
TREY.
>> Trey: BREAKING NEWS HERE, 
EARLIER TODAY, ROCKETS FIRED 
TOWARD ISRAEL'S SECOND LARGEST 
CITY TEL AVIV, SENDING PEOPLE TO
BOMB SHELTERS.
10 ROCKETS FROM THE GAZA STRIP.
FORCES CONTINUE TO MAKE THEIR 
WAY DEEPER INTO GAZA FOCUSING ON
NORTHERN GAZA'S NEIGHBORHOOD.
YOU SEE A UNIT OPERATING THIS 
THIS AREA ENGAGED IN CLOSE 
QUARTER CONTACT.
THEY SAY HAMAS FIGHTERS PREPARED
AN AMBUSH, BUT WERE THWARTED.
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU HAS 
THIS WARNING FOR HAMAS.
>> IN RECENT DAYS, DOZENS OF 
HAMAS TERRORISTS HAVE BEEN 
SURRENDERING, HANDING OVER TO 
HEROIC FIGHTERS.
IT WILL TAKE TIME, THE WAR IS IN
FULL SWING, THIS IS BEGINNING OF
THE END MUCH HAMAS.
I SAY TO HAMAS TERRORISTS, IT IS
OVER, SURRENDER NOW.
>> Trey: HE IS TALKING ABOUT 
SINWAR, LEADER OF HAMAS IN 
QATAR.
THE CHIEF OF STAFF HERE VISITING
TROOPS THIS WEEKEND AS ISRAEL 
SET A DEADLINE FOR ATTEMPTS TO 
REACH A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO 
PUSH THE MIITANT GROUP          
HEZBOLLAH.
THERE IS LOW CHANCE OF FINDING 
SOLUTION IN THE NORTH.
FOCUS IS ON THE SOUTHERN FRONT 
WITH GAZA, THERE ARE 137 
HOSTAGES BEING HOLD BY HAMAS.
>> Brian: IS PART OF POST-WAR 
GAZA, ARE THEY RECOMMENDING 
HAMAS BE A JUNIOR PARTNER?
DON'T THEY KNOW THAT IS 
NONSTARTER WITH THE ISRAELI 
GOVERNMENT?
>> Trey: I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT 
AND ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS WE'RE
TALKING WITH, THEY WILL CONTINUE
TO PUSH THROUGH GAZA UNTIL THEY 
DEGRADE AND DESTROY HAMAS AS AN 
ORGANIZATION.
CRITICS OF THE ISRAELI 
GOVERNMENT SAY THIS IS NOT 
POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE 
ORGANIZATION IS BUILT AROUND 
IDEOLOGY AND YOU DON'T HAVE 
FIGHTERS IN GAZA, BUT WEST BANK.
HAMAS IS POPULAR WHEN IT COMES 
TO BEING A POLITICAL PARTY AND 
ISRAELI FORCES WILL OPERATE IN 
GAZA UNTIL THEY KILL OR CAPTURE 
SENIOR HAMAS LEADERSHIP AND 
DESTROY AS MANY LOW-LEVEL 
FIGHTERS AS POSSIBLE.
WHO CONTROLS GAZA NEXT AND WHAT
