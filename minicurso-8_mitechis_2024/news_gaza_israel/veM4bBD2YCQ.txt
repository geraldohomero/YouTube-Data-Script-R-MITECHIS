>>> WELCOME BACK.
>>> WELCOME BACK.
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ISRAEL SAYS
IT'S PUSHING FORWARD WITH ITS
ASSAULT IN SOUTHERN GAZA IN AN
EFFORT TO ROOT OUT HAMAS.
THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY SAYING
WARPLANES STRUCK TARGETS IN THE
STRIP AND ITS FORCES HAD
ENGAGED IN BATTLE IN A
NEIGHBORHOOD EAST OF GAZA CITY.
ACCORDING TO THE PALESTINIAN
HEALTH MINISTRY, 17,700 PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN GAZA SO
FAR.
WE WANT TO BRING IN NBC NEWS
CORRESPONDENT --
FROM TEL AVIV WITH MORE ON
THIS.
I WANT TO TALK, IF WE CAN,
ABOUT THE ONGOING HOSTAGE
SITUATION INSIDE GAZA.
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT
RELEASING AN UPDATE ON THAT.
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
THAT?
>> REPORTER: RIGHT.
THEY ARE CONFIRMING 137
HOSTAGES REMAIN IN CAPTIVITY,
IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY INSIDE OF
GAZA.
THEY ARE ALSO SAYING 20 HAVE
DIED SINCE OCTOBER 7TH.
SO THAT IS NOT AS PART OF THE
137.
THAT IS IN ADDITION.
THAT WOULD INCLUDE STARBUCK,
WHO IS THE HOSTAGE WHO WAS
CONFIRMED DEAD BY THE BERRY
KIBBUTZ YESTERDAY, WHO WAS A
SOLDIER, WE UNDERSTAND, PERHAPS
KILLED IN AN ATTEMPTED RESCUE
OPERATION AND THE 20 HOSTAGES
KILLED, MURDERED.
THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE SAY
SINCE OCTOBER 7TH REMAINING 137
CAPTIVES, OF COURSE.
SO MANY FAMILIES ACROSS THIS
COUNTRY WANTING THESE HOSTAGES
TO BE RELEASED.
SOME VERY ANGRY, IN FACT, WITH
THE PRIME MINISTER, BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU, WHO REMAINS DEEPLY
UNPOPULAR IN THIS COUNTRY.
SOME OF THEM ARE ACCUSING THE
PRIME MINISTER OF PLACING HIS
MILITARY OBJECTIVES ABOVE THE
LIVES OF THE REMAINING HOSTAGES
IN THE HANDS OF HAMAS.
MEANTIME, THE HUMANITARIAN
SITUATION, YASMIN, IS
DETERIORATING DAY-BY-DAY.
THE AGENCY OXFAM SAYS IT HAS
GONE FROM CATASTROPHIC TO
APOCALYPTIC.
THIS AS THE IDF CONTINUES TO
OPERATE DEEP IN SOUTHERN GAZA.
AND AS THE CIVILIAN POPULATION
HAS PUSHED INTO SMALLER AND
SMALLER ENCLAVES, INCLUDING IN
RAFAH, AT THE VERY SOUTH, THIS
IS ON THE BORDER WITH EGYPT,
WHERE WE ARE SEEING THE
HOSPITALS AT THE BRINK THERE.
AND ALSO JUST ORDINARY FAMILIES
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN.
WE HEARD FROM A MOTHER SAYING
SHE CAN'T GET INJECTIONS AND
MEDICINE SHE NEEDS FOR HER
DISABLED CHILD.
IT'S REALLY RUN-OF-THE-MILL,
DAILY ISSUES AND MEDICAL
COMPLAINTS THAT ARE GOING
UNANSWERED RIGHT NOW.
ALL THE WHILE, LITTLE FOOD,
