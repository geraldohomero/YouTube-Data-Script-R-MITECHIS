Hope since October 7th Israel's constant
bombardment of Gaza has stripped
Palestinians of safety security and
dignity but many online within Gaza have
found strength in the Region's Rich
library of resistance songs that span
decades ever since the occupation
began through the halls of Al Hospital
in Northern Gaza Medics sing
safka it translates into here we shall
stay a message echoed by Palestinians
throughout the bes strip I think it's a
common misconception particularly people
hearing the music for the first time or
people in Europe perhaps um or in the in
the states and they assume that
Palestinian music is is all about
sadness actually I think Palestinian
music overall in many of its varieties
carries this really strong sense of
optimism musicians globally are
channeling that same energy back a gut

shut down we live in

I'll randomly open up an app and find
out that they've either taken down my
posts or um they've temporarily deleted
my account this is due to some mix of
hate speech Andor going around uh going
against Community guidelines I encourage
everyone listening to this to go listen
to my music and find one line where I
incite any amount of violence uh I'm
sure that you
won't regardless of the backlash

hit a strong note telling the story of a
resilient people and remembering those
lost and the future of generations to
come IMR Lan
