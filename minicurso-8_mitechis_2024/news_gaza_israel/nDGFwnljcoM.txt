we have your back we feel your pain we
ache with you and we and our country
will stand by you in these difficult
times Israel is a strong nation and at
this moment we say to Israel You Are Not
Alone the United States stands alongside
you as an unrelenting
partner as the first Jewish majority
leader and the highest ranking Jewish
elected official ever in America I felt
I had to be here I wanted to be here but
I also had an obligation to be here and
we had good and productive meetings with
prime minister Netanyahu National Unity
party chairman Benny Gant defense
minister Galant Minister gadd uh
Minister Ron durmer and the whole war
council we also met with President Isaac
Herzog and opposition leader yair lei
and we met with the families of the
victims of this brutal
attack people who didn't know if their
relatives were dead or alive and some of
them already knew that they were
hostages when we met them there was not
a dry eye in the house we cried openly
it was so moving these people what
they're going through right now because
of the vicious horrible
inhuman nastiness of
Hamas we also experienced what Israelis
experience almost every day we were
having a lunch up in the
hotel and the sirens went off we heard
them and we were all rushed into a
shelter and had to stay there until the
coast was clear and then a few minutes
ago this press conference was delayed
for the same reason
so Israelis are affected all the time by
hamas's warlike
attitudes look there are no words for
the horror that happened last Saturday
it shook me to my core I think about it
all the time I see the pictures of the
little children and I think what if my
four-year-old Grand what if this
happened to my four-year-old
grandson most Jews
killed in a single day since the
Holocaust more than on crystal
