HEART OF GAZA CITY AS THEY 
CONTINUE RAID OF AL-SHIFA 
HOSPITAL.

INSIGHT.

THEY ARE STILL SEARCHING FOR THE
TUNNELS THEY SAY ARE BENEATH THE
HOSPITAL.

SAY BELONGED TO HAMAS IN AN MRI 
ROOM HERE ON ONE SIDE OF THE

WHEN YOU LOOK BEHIND THE 
MACHINE, YOU SEE WEAPONS AND 
AMMUNITION.

GO SO THEY COULD CONTINUE 
ENGAGING ISRAELI FORCES IN THE 
HEART OF GAZA CITY.

BROCHURES FOR COMMANDERS, HOW TO
ATTACK A TANK AND WHAT TYPE OF 
AMMUNITION TO USE IN WHAT KIND 
OF SITUATION.

SHOW THE TUNNELS THEY CLAIM ARE 
BENEATH AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL.
