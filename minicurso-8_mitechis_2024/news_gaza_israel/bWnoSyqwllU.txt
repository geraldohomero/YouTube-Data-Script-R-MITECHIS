ALONE, BAREFOOT, WITH NO PANTS
ON A BUSY ROAD KNOWN TO BE
DANGEROUS. YOU CAN SEE THE
DRIVER PULL OVER AND BRING THE
LITTLE BOY ON BOARD THE BUS AND
GIVE HIM A JACKET. MORE
HUMANITARIAN AID FROM CYPRUS
WILL SOON BE HEADING TO WAR TORN
GAZA. WORKERS FROM THE US
CHARITY WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN
LOADED DESPERATELY NEEDED FOOD
AND SUPPLIES ONTO A CARGO VESSEL
AT A PORT NEARBY TO SHIP INTO
THE ENCLAVE. HAMAS HAS RELEASED
NEW DETAILS OF A POSSIBLE
CEASEFIRE PROPOSAL. IT INCLUDES
THE RELEASE OF HOSTAGES AND NOW
THE BALL IS IN ISRAEL'S COURT.
MADELINE RIVERA HAS MORE FROM
WASHINGTON. AS THE FIGHTING
GRINDS ON IN THE GAZA STRIP,
ISRAEL'S WAR CABINET IS MEETING
TO CONSIDER A NEW CEASEFIRE
PROPOSAL FROM HAMAS. IT'S A TWO
STEP PLAN. IN THE FIRST PHASE,
HAMAS WOULD RELEASE ISRAELI
WOMEN, CHILDREN, THE ELDERLY AND
THOSE WITH HEALTH ISSUES IN
EXCHANGE FOR UP TO 1000
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS. AFTER
THAT, BOTH SIDES WOULD AGREE ON
A DATE FOR ISRAEL'S WITHDRAWAL
FROM GAZA, FOLLOWED BY THE
RELEASE OF THE REMAINING
HOSTAGES. IT'S NOT YET CLEAR HOW
ISRAEL WOULD RESPOND, BUT IT'S
UNLIKELY THEY'D ORDER A FULL
STOP TO THEIR OFFENSIVE. WE ARE
WILLING TO PAY A HEAVY PRICE TO
ONE THING WE WILL NOT COMPROMISE
IN THAT OUR DEMAND NOT TO STOP
THE WAR UNTIL HAMAS IS
ERADICATED. THE NEW PROPOSAL WAS
ANNOUNCED JUST ONE DAY AFTER
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK
SCHUMER SUGGESTED ISRAEL HOLD
NEW ELECTIONS, A DIRECT SHOT AT
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU. THOSE COMMENTS
PROMPTING SIGNIFICANT CRITICISM
FROM ISRAELI OFFICIALS, EVEN
POLITICAL RIVAL, CALLED
SCHUMER'S SUGGESTION, QUOTE,
INCORRECT AND UNACCEPTABLE. THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NOW
DISTANCING ITSELF FROM SCHUMER'S
REMARKS, SAYING HE WAS SPEAKING
FOR HIMSELF, NOT THE WHITE
HOUSE. I'M SURE THAT THEY FULLY
UNDERSTAND THAT HE SPEAKS FOR
HIMSELF. HE'S OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE
WE'RE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH, BUT
IT'S NOT A STATEMENT FROM THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH. MEANWHILE, THE
U.S. RELEASED THE FINAL DRAFT OF
A UN RESOLUTION AIMED AT
STOPPING THE FIGHTING IN GAZA,
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHEN IT WILL
