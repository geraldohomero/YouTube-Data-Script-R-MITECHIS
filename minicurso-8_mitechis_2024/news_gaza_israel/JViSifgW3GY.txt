Well let's know now with Carolina
Nelson the first the first message of
People who have been rescued
We do not remind you not Fernando
Marman and Luis J something that moves
Mundo Carolina moves the world too
So this operation implied but
These two men sent him a message
To rescuers who were
in command of that operation that saves them
Life Let's remember after more than 4
Months of captivity in the hands of the group
Terrorist never remember that
The operation was carried out in Rafa
At the southern end of the Gaza Strip
an area in which there is also more than one
million and a half of people who left
displacing from different points of the
Strip there but it seems to them
We can really share that message
Very moving words from Fernando
Marman and Luis Jar one of them
You can't virtually talk because
Imagine what you have traveled

SHARE IT COL

Hi
Strong listening from your own voice this
testimony yes and and also very
strong have been announced throughout
Today's afternoon in official accounts
from Israel who have to do with
Israel operations in the strip of
Gaza and in particular with the finding of
images that Israel says document the
escape from one of the ever leaders
Shia Singar and have also documented the
place where this person hid
finding there not only live is
humanitarian aid that had actually
be destined for civilians good
have made this aid according to
What Israel denounces but also
A lot of money at a point where
This very important leader was one of
the main responsible according to
Israel of the October 7 attack and for
assumption was also your family a
entourage who protected him and his family
and attention with this because I also know
They have announced in official accounts
Israel images where he looks fleeing
Together with minors, his
own children attention with this because
There may be news regarding
Israel operations in Rafa despite
The international community even
The United States has warned that
any operation must be done with
a lot of shelter for the enormous
civilian population that is now in that
Point at the southern end of the strip
Thanks Carolita
