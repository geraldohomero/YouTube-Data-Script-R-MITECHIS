on the outskirts of Laacneette in Jerusalem the
tension rises from a notch in the
Sunday evening of demonstrators by
hundreds blocked this road in
Lighting lights symbol of their anger
Towards the far -right government
cannon shot at high and in the middle of
protesters are dislodged
unreachable by the forces of
order all day the cries of
distress and anger of the crowd have
reasoned in the Ru of Jerusalem with
one watchword resign from
Benyamin Netaniaahou and the return of
hostages is my country I was born here my
country was destroyed by our first
minister of people are killed in Gaza
Palestinians are killed I am against
This war I am against these losses
humans of all
sides when Natthaniaahou wants some
thing he knows how to get it the fact
that there is still no agreement on
The hostages means that he does not want it
Again
It is because he knows that one day the
war will end and the hostages
will be back all the people here and
Many others will ask him like this
that in its bad government of
resign a Prime Minister under
pressure in full negotiation with the
Islamist movement in the band of
Gaza and while the conflict bangs
for 6 months aware of his big
unpopularity within the population
Israeli Benamin Netanahou took the
speech in stride to try to
reassure citizens in particular
close to hostage in the hands of
Hamas they call for election outfit
Immediate in the middle of war just before
Victory will paralyze Israel during
minus 6 months or even 8 months
will paralyze negotiations for
release of our hostages and will put in
war before we reached our
objectives and the first beneficiary
would be the
Hamas a speech that has become inaudible che

already announced that they will descend
In the street every next night
with the same
claims
