the international court of justice or
icj recently made a decision regarding
the conflict in Gaza involving
Israel let's dive into the recent events
involving Israel and the international
court of
justice let's break it down in simple
terms now remember the icj cannot force
countries to do things but its decisions
carry a lot of symbolic
weight so what did the icj say Well it
told Israel to do everything it can to
prevent acts that could be considered
genocide in Gaza that's a big deal in
the world of international
law but here is the catch the court did
not order an immediate stop to the
fighting which is what some people
wanted this means there is more legal
stuff to figure out and it could take a
long
time why does this matter well over
26,000 people have lost their lives in
the conflict and many more have been
displaced from their
homes the icj's decision puts pressure
on Israel to reconsider its military
actions other countries like turkey
Egypt and even the European Union are
saying Israel needs to follow what the
icj is suggesting
but here is the thing the court cannot
force Israel to do
anything it's up to Israel to decide how
it wants to
respond now the United States which is a
close Ally of Israel says the
accusations of genocide are not
true
however the US agrees with the icj on
some points like minimizing harm to
civilians and providing more
humanitarian
assistance in the end this is a
significant moment but it's just the
beginning of a long legal
process from breaking news detailed
