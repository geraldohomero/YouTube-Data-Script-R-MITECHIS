How to understand this attack on the light of
international right
Humanitarian thanks I think there is no
possibility of conceiving anything that
It is happening at the theater of
Gaza operations as part of the
Humanitarian system of caution
Human Rights or what goes
to happen from now on in me
criteria is a confrontation in which
It will be increasingly uncertain where
The author is coming but
I think that the principle of respect for
Human Rights Eh evaporated from the
First minute of this conflict I think
that there is also no possibility to ask for
None of the parties that mark your
behavior when there is such a decision
radical of both parties in a case of
violate the border and attack how
Israel attacked and the other unleashed
How Israel is unleashing a
disproportionate retaliation on the
Palestine population indicated that
We still don't know who it was and what no
We will know the responsibility many of
The attacks however there is a
statement from the same hospital that indicates
that Israel is responsible for this
bombardment while Israel says that
The Islamic Yada fired a missile against
the iron dome in Israel and that this
bouncing thus generating the explosion in the
Hospital to whom
Believing him, there is no possibility of believing him
No one starts from the nature of a
asymmetric conflict of a war
hybrid is that propaganda is to say the
public opinion space is the first
that suffers the consequences eh we are
in front of a scenario in which I do not
could give credit to either
parts and yet the absolute fact
is that an attack on a hospital happened
an attack on a hospital who is who
Be it detonated the trigger is
result of rape practices
Structural human rights as for
example of putting a base or an EH
station or a military arsenal on farms
of a hospital from a school of
Facilities that are good for
Rocket attacks definitely
but that the epona or the
instrumentalization as human shields
It is in itself a violation of
Human Rights Eh Conclusion We are not going
To be able to establish who raped first
human rights or who generated that
risk situation that ended with the
Disaster at Gaza Hospital or
Finally who threw the trigger
It is true that this conflict is a
conflict that I don't see a perspective
from solution
