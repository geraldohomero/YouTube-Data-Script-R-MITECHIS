major
Bascal if the investiture finally goes ahead
And a progressive government is formed will recognize
The legitimacy of the government will form a
Progressive government will form a government
coup will form a government that will happen
to be illegitimate as the previous legislature
and I explain it again because I think there are
Many people who have not yet understood
Because I think you are journalists
And I understand that they defend the truth will understand that
It is not legitimate to lie will be legal but not legitimate
And they will share with us that the government of
Pedro SÃ¡nchez agreed to power blending
and brutally to the Spaniards in the previous
Legislature and that's why we talk about a government
illegitimate now a
illegal government why an illegal government because
The government will put a law on the table
of amnesty that does not fit in the Constitution that is
an amnesty law completely unconstitutional
that does not fit in a constitution that prohibits the
general pardons that are somewhat less serious yet
that an amnesty therefore obviously and
We have said these days do not believe that
This government will find a novel holder
It goes from being illegitimate to directly illegal and that
This is what we are going to say about this government
Throughout the legislature they tell us what
They tell us qualify us how they qualify us
And assuming what I have told you in the last
part of my speech that this only has
an end and is or the autocrat with a tyrant eagerness
sitting on the bench or those that we oppose
to the coup in jail but the resistance that is
It starts at this time before a government that is
willing to anyone who is willing to destroy
The Constitution to be agreed with the terrorists
and to agree with the coup plotters and with any
enemy of Spain and any enemy of
freedoms we obviously know what consequences
Has good afternoon lady Bascal coincii yaah
