YESTERDAY IN GAZA BRINGING IDF 
CASUALTIES INSIDE GAZA TO AT 
LEAST 12.
>> Carley: TREY YINGST IS LIVE 
IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL WITH THE 
LATEST.
GOOD MORNING.
>> Trey: TODD AND CARLEY, GOOD 
MORNING.
ISRAELI MILITARY HAS UPDATED THE
DEATH TOLL FROM THE INCIDENT 
THAT TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY 
MORNING WHERE ANTI-TAKE WAS 
FIRED AT SOLDIERS INSIDE GAZA.
THAT DEATH TOLL REACHED 10 
PEOPLE IN ADDITION TO TWO OTHERS
ANNOUNCED EARLY YESTERDAY BY 
ISRAELI MILITARY FROM THE GIVATI
BRIGADE RECONNAISSANCE UNIT.
THERE ARE BATTLES INSIDE THE 
GAZA STRIP.
LAST NIGHT ALONG THE BORDER, WE 
COULD HEAR THE GUNFIRE AND 
ISRAELIS CALL NOTHING AIR 
SUPPORT TO SUPPORT SOLDIERS ON 
THE GROUND.
THIS WILL BE A DIFFICULT 
STREET-BY-STREET BATTLE AS 
ISRAEL LOOKS TO PUSH DEEPER INTO
GAZA IN EFFORTS TO DESTROY

ON THE GIVALIA REFUGEE CAMP, 
ISRAELIS SAY AROUND 50 MILITANTS
WERE KILLED, INCLUDING BERARI, A
TOP COMMANDER THAT LED THE 
GIVALIA GROUP.
THE ISRAELIINGS ARE GETTING NEW 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF 
CIVILIANS KILLED IN THOSE 
STRIKES AND THESE ARE LEGITIMATE
QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ASKED

HOW MANY CIVILIANS THEY KNEW 
WERE IN THE AREA AND HOW MANY 
THEY BELIEVE WERE KILLED AS A 
RESULT.
LAST NIGHT ON A BRIEFING WITH A 
SPOKESMAN FOR THE ISRAELI 
MILITARY AND HE DISCUSSED THIS 
ISSUE, SAYING THE TARGET FOR 
ISRAELIS WAS THIS TOP COMMANDER 
AND THERE WAS COLLATERAL DAMAGE 
AND THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE 
INCIDENT.
THIS IS THE ENVIRONMENT THE 
ISRAELIS ARE FIGHTING IN AND WE 
EXPECT MORE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES 
AMID THIS WAR.
RAFAH CROSSING BETWEEN GAZA AND 
EGYPT WILL BE OPEN TODAY TO 
ALLOW FOR SOME INJURED 
PALESTINIANS TO LEAVE AND 
FOREIGN NATIONALS.
THIS IS A VERY POSITIVE 
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE AMERICAN 
CITIZENS TRAPPED INSIDE GAZA.
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF 
THEM, THEY REMAIN TERRIFIED.
THEY HAVE BEEN STUCK IN GAZA 
SINCE OCTOBER 7.
