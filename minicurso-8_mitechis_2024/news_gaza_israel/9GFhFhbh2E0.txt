after friday prayers they arrived kites
were launched and sent over the security
fence to torch crops in israel it wasn't
long before israel's military responded
despite so many casualties during the
past two months many palestinians of all
ages came to show their defiance at the
border
they want to show the world that we are
just conduct a peaceful administration
and they want to show the real face of
the israeli
forces that even we are peaceful people
the
ki
target us
by using exclusive
bullets or
live bullets all week the focus has been
on this last friday of ramadan
islamic jihad fighters marched silently
through the gaza strip to motivate
palestinians and events to remember the
anniversary of the 1967 arab-israeli war
were cancelled
authorities at mosques all through
thursday encourage people to protest at
the border
despite his age ahmed mohammed abu
tarush needs no motivation he goes east
friday
i feel i am full of life as i walk with
all those young people around me
but it's a fact that the oldest in our
society and all the other people too
should participate at these matches
because we should die before these young
people
we've lived long enough
medical staff had a quieter day and it
seemed israel's army were more
restrained the ambulances other medics
try and hang back as much as they can
but they are still within the line of
fire of snipers and the tear gas that's
been fired from the other side of the
security fence here by the israelis
this protest feels less frenetic than
during the last few weeks but still
dozens of people have been injured by
live ammunition or by the gas
for hours tear gas canisters rained down
as the protest petered out high ranking
hamas officials arrived the appearance
of its political leader ishmael hanya
was similar to his superstars he stayed
well away from the fence and remained
only long enough to claim credit for
another show of defiance
yolo after trt world malacca on the gaza
israel border
