THIS IS STEMMING FROM HAMAS'
ATTACK.
LAURA BARRETT HAS TONIGHT'S
ORIGINAL.
>> Reporter: IN A NEW ESSAY, --
TALKS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF
DRAWING A LINE BETWEEN WHAT
SPEECH IS AND ISN'T ALLOWED ON
CAMPUS.
AND THE CURRENT RESURGENCE OF
ANTI-SEMITISM ON UNIVERSITY
CAMPUSES IS INTOLERABLE
REGARDLESS.
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE FAMILIAR,
RIGHT?
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF PENNSYLVANIA, HARVARD AND
M.I.T.
>> AND DR. ARE GAY AT  HARVARD,
CALLING FOR THE GENOCIDE OF
JEWS.
YES OR NO?
>> IT CAN BE, DEPENDING ON THE
CONTEXT.
>> IF THE SPEECH BECOMES
CONDUCT, IT CAN BE HARASSMENT.
>> YES.
>> CONDUCT MEANING COMMITTING
THE ACT OF GENOCIDE?
>> WITHIN WEEKS,  LEADERS OF
BOTH HARVARD AND U.N. QUIT.

WORKFORCE COMMITTEE WHICH IS

TO FIND COMMON GROUND.
NOT JUST MAKE COLLEGE CAMPUSES
SAFER, BEFORE THE FATE OF
DEMOCRACY.
>> LAURA IS JOINING US NOW.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THIS COMING UP AND THE
ONE -- THAT THE PRESIDENT OF
COLUMBIA HAS HAD MONTHS TO
PREPARE HERE.
RIGHT?
DO WE EXPECT THAT TO HAVE AN
IMPACT?
SHE WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT WHAT
ALREADY WENT DOWN WITH HER
COLLEAGUES.
>> EXACTLY.
SHE DEFINITELY HAS A LEG UP.
SHE'S ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO PUT
ON THE RECORD THE QUESTION THAT
TRIPPED UP SO MANY OF THE
PRESIDENTS, THAT WHETHER A CALL
FOR THE GENOCIDE OF JEWS GOES
AGAINST IT.
THE WEBSITE DOES SAY THAT IT IS
INCONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES. A
SPOKESPERSON ALSO RELEASED A
STATEMENT SAYING THEY ARE
COMMITTED TO COMBATING ANTI-
SEMITISM AND WE WELCOME THE
OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT AND
SUPPORT JEWISH STUDENTS AND KEEP
OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE.
