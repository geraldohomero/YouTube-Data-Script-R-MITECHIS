Well we continue with more titles
International we are going to go in
moments once again to Palestine
particularly to the Gaza Strip
because it seems that many times the
policy in terms of management those
decisions made in an office
In an office they are far from understanding
what happens in the plain on the street in
This time in the strip of
gaza and we propose this situation
Because there is a huge amount of help
humanitarian that could enter the
gauze strip and that could serve to
Avoid death for example of people
patients who need medications that
I could feed children issues
elementary basics but does not reach gauze
As much as you have in fact you
They can see that in the central part of the
screen there are a series of trucks that
They are located behind the other good
That is full of merchandise for
These people but do not enter because
There is an Israeli block this has to
See good with multiple obstacles
Basically the chief of one of the

people who support ever have
our people as they forward and collaborate with

Palestine not that I have not many times
It has anything to do or has no incidence
directly or does not have the power to be able
It is precisely to manipulate situations
because they are poor people also in their
HUGE MORE Even so reading
policy that is done is that they support
Never and how is a terrorist group not
They have the right to access these
food and are stranded eh
Made on Sunday night the average
Palestine red moon reported that there were
123 trucks that were in Gaza but
none could enter by these
Protests meanwhile the UN ensures
that these manifestations that in the
Truck step and this affects the
good humanitarian aid reserves everything
what is stored in these
trucks would now be fundamental to
saving lives but obviously it is something
that does not matter that it is not a priority and
This war continues to develop from
on the 7th of
October
