The same theme wanted to open another because
It is true that it has just come to us
The writing and I think it is interesting
Also commenting it we said at the beginning
of the program that the United States had
said to its citizens to abandon
please the country of Lebanon already know
That is one of the neighboring countries of
Israel Country that is also
With bombing attacks
constant around the border with
Israel and who had asked for the United States
to its citizens who abandon that
Good territory then now the kingdom
Unido seems to do the same what
We have just known is that the embassy
British there in the country in Lebanon
He just said that good to all
citizens who are there that are in
The Lebanon who asks for them strongly
that leave the country while all
commercial options are maintained
available we understand and options
Travel flight commercials
to travel outside eh and return to the
United Kingdom says that huh citizens
British should be cautious and
Avoid areas where and
clear demonstrations are already two countries
Anglo -Saxons in this case the United States
and the United Kingdom who are asking
to its citizens who leave the
Lebanon territory we know that in the
border right now there are attacks there are
bombings that Israel even asked for
Anyone who lived or was
near the border with the Lebanon that
Evacua that area but of course we are already
reaching the point to which countries such as
United Kingdom and the United States are
asking its citizens to
I leave eh I'm going to ask Antonio
also if you believe that these warnings
from the United States and the United Kingdom
They have a background beyond if huh
United States and United Kingdom then
It would
