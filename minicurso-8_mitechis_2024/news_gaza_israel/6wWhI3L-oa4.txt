AMBASSADOR, BY GETTING YOUR
REACTION TO THE HORRIFIC EVENTS
THAT UNFOLDED IN ISRAEL
YESTERDAY.
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU SEE THIS
AS A MAJOR INTELLIGENCE FAILURE?
>> WELL, I THINK THAT THERE WILL
BE A TIME AND PLACE TO DEAL WITH
WHO IT WAS AN INTELLIGENCE
FAILURE.
WHAT I WANT AMERICAN PEOPLE TO
KNOW IS IMAGINE THE ISRAELI
PEOPLE WOKE UP TO SEE THEIR OWN
CITIZENS DRAGGED IN THE STREETS,
THE ELDERLY, CHILDREN, WOMEN
TAKEN AS HOSTAGES, WHOLE
FAMILIES MURDERED AND SO NOW
TODAY THE ISRAELI PEOPLE IN THE
COUNTRY ARE HAVING TO FACE THE
FACT THAT THEIR LOVED ONES ARE
BEING DEPLOYED, THAT THEY ARE
HAVING TO GO TO THE FRONT LINES
TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY, THAT
BUSINESSES ARE HAVING TO BE
SHUTTERED BECAUSE THEIR WORKERS
ARE LEAVING TO GO DEFEND THE
COUNTRY AND BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD
A MASSIVE TERRORIST ATTACK AND
SO I THINK THAT ONE PRAYS FOR
DETERMINATION AND STRENGTH FOR
THE ISRAELI PEOPLE, BUT WHAT I
WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO KNOW
IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY WERE
DRAGGING THOSE PEOPLE IN THE
STREETS?
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY WERE
MURDERING INNOCENT ISRAELIS?
HAMAS AND THE BACKERS WHO
SUPPORT THEM, THE IRANIAN REGIME
WERE CHANTING DEATH TO ISRAEL,
DEATH TO AMERICA.
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER.
WE ARE UNITED WITH ISRAEL
BECAUSE WE ARE UNITED BECAUSE
BOTH HAMAS, HEZBOLLAH, THE
HOUTHIS AND THE IRANIAN BACKERS,
THEY HATE US AND WE HAVE TO
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN ISRAEL
CAN HAPPEN HERE IN AMERICA, AND
I HOPE WE ALL UNITE AND STAND
WITH ISRAEL BECAUSE THEY REALLY
NEED US RIGHT NOW.
>> QUICK FOLLOW UP THERE,
AMBASSADOR, DOES THAT MEAN THAT
YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
POTENTIAL ATTACKS ON THE HOME
FRONT IN THE WAKE OF WHAT WE SAW
IN ISRAEL.
>> I HAVE BEEN CONCERNED.
I HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY WORRIED
ABOUT THE FACT THAT IRAN HAS
SAID THE EASIEST WAY TO GET INTO
AMERICA IS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN
BORDER.
WE HAVE AN OPEN BORDER.
PEOPLE ARE COMING THROUGH.
THEY'RE NOT BEING VETTED.
WE DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR
ANOTHER 9/11.
YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT,
KRISTEN, AMERICA IS INCREDIBLY
DISTRACTED AND INCREDIBLY
DIVIDED AND THE WORLD IS LESS
SAFE AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED
IN ISRAEL.
THEY WAITED FOR THEM TO BE
DISTRACTED AND THAT'S WHEN YOUR
ENEMIES MOVE IN.
AMERICA NEEDS TO WAKE UP.
WE NEED TO PUT THIS NEGATIVITY
AND DIVISION BEHIND US AND WE
