They continue in mobilizations
really very massive in support of
Palestinians in support of the Gaza Strip
by the Israeli siege that are
suffering look at what you are
mobilizing right now
When we say massive is what they see in
screen and it's not the first time they are already
many manifestations that are
give in Yemen that have been giving from
On October 7 of last year at EH
support
PU and this is happening now we are
working live the with different
BANKS POSTERS
Palestinian flags and chanting
Support for the G of this
Punctually it occurs in the streets of the
Capital Saná the capital of De Yemen for
Protest we said well marked Sofi
In solidarity with gaza promptly with
the Palestinian people and with those
civilians in many cases children and women
that of course are in the middle of the
Cross fire really many civilians who
They are injured that are
killed that even
They also have restrictions on
Be able to receive provisions
food access to access
Also in case of having powerful injuries
approach a hospital without the fear of
become bombarded or to stay
I insist in the middle of the crossfire
So that's why the
Yemenis to the streets and is really
shocking is not very much but
A lot of people umbrella banks
three large flags that are
come there allusive to Palestine by
assumption the truth that is
shocking and allows me to use a
Anja phrase does not enter a sight mir there
We have two different shots one more
aerial and a somewhat closer to
street in s and both are shocking
They truly took the streets of
Saná in the capital there of
Yemen to make this request for a high
the fire no and solidarity ins
We reiterate with
Palese
And another thing to highlight about this and
with this
We close is not the first march
massive this has been giving
how insistently loses go to
The streets go to the capital to
main streets of Saná a
manifest in favor of the people
Palestine against progress

These posters with the flags angry
