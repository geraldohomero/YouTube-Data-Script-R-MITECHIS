tonight
tonight hamas defiant parading down the
streets of gaza this weekend for the
first time
since fighting with israel began two
weeks ago
and with israeli tanks trucked back to
their bases secretary of state tony
blinken headed to the region today
we have to deal with making this turn
from the violence we've got the
ceasefire
and now deal with the humanitarian
situation the u.s hoping to freeze hamas
from incoming humanitarian aid
but as we found out driving an hour
south of gaza city
to an area where hamas was seen exhuming
the bodies of militants from its bombed
out network of tunnels
the group is very much in control as
soon as we got out of the car
our palestinian producer got a call
telling us we cannot be
here and basically just got kicked out
and everywhere
collateral damage
dunya assalia's daughter dima was killed
by an explosion last week
right outside their house
dunya tells me an israeli drone killed
her daughter but the israeli military
tells us
it never targeted that location dima was
buried last week
and her scent is the most precious thing
her mother has left
she tells me it brings her comfort it
still clings to her pillow and her
blanket
and dunya clings to them
secretary blink and david arrives in the
region early tomorrow he'll be meeting
with officials from israel and the
palestinian authority

been pushing hard for a two-state
solution

without engaging hamas

guppin will be following it into
tomorrow for us matt thank you
