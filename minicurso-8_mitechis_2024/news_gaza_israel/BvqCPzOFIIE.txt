I told them at the beginning of the program
that there are two important news in the
Conflict in the Middle East the first of
They in which we saw the rejection of
Prime Minister of Israel Benjam√≠n Entao
to the possibility of a truce with the
Terrorist group ever the other happened
about an hour ago one hour and
average back has to do with the
response that states continues
United to what was the murder of three
of his soldiers in Jordan already two ago
Sundays where there have already been
Armamentism from that
determination made by the president of
The United States but today occurred
As I said very little ago in
Argentina's afternoon already at night
of the Middle East an attack through
A drone about a vehicle in Iraq in
Baghdad in the capital of Iraq where
a
Membol member and that has been the
News of the afternoon night and what
We are seeing in images now has
to do with the protests that
produced by this attack of
the United States that has killed
The high -ranking katb commander
Hisbol the Iraqi armed group supported
by Iran to which the Pentagon linked to
the recent death and the attack in which
Three good soldiers died on
This incursion is the one that
We are having drones through
of a vehicle has then made states
United to provoke the death of one of the
high -ranking commanders like them
Cat Hisbol story one of the sources
familiar with what has happened
There he says three people died and
that the attacked vehicle was used
For popular mobilization forces
of Iraq that is a security agency
of the State composed of dozens of
armed groups many of them are
next to Iran here we see the car how
The vehicle was after the
attack produced by a drone of the
state
