everybody.  I do  want  
to take you out to  a live  
view  that  we  do  have  
right here. This  is  Gaza  
and it  is  from  Southern  
Israel  right there.  That  
is  what  you're looking  at  
on  your  screen  at  this  
hour. I do  want to go  over  
some  of  the basics  here  
as  president Biden is  
appearing to  call  for a 
quote pause in the  conflict  
between Israel  and Hamas.  
a Heckler pushing for a 
ceasefire confronting 
by noon during  a campaign  
event Wednesday in  
Minnesota.  the woman stood 
up  shouting  quote as  a 
rabbi I need  you to  call  
for a ceasefire.  right now.  
The president does  respond 
quote I think we  need a  
pause.  a pause means give  
time  to  get the prisoners 
out.  We do actually  have  
some  of that audio right 
here  was shot  by  someone 
and provided  two-story fall  
and then  pass along our  
way.  I do  want to play  
that  for you here  
and unfiltered. and only  
about 10  seconds in  length. 
Oh my God.  Alright, so those 
comments  made  of  course  
as  I mentioned during  a 
campaign  event yesterday in  
Minnesota.  afterward the 
president does  respond quote 
I think we  need  a pause.  
a pause means give  time  to  
get the prisoners out.  the 
comment comes ahead of  
us Secretary  of  State 
Anthony blinken is  third 
trip  to  Israel  since the 
start of  the war.  The 
Lincoln is  slated  to  speak 
with  Israeli leaders 
tomorrow  then  head over to  
Jordan. Israel's  ground  
troops. Advancing toward  
Gaza  City  nearly  
four weeks. after Hamas did 
attack. Israel  back. on  
October.  7th killing 
at least. 1,300 people. and 
taking  well  over. 
two hundred hostages  some  
numbers saying  more  than  
240.  for a second  day the 
rafah border  crossing  is  
open allowing.  hundreds  of  
foreign passport  holders and 
wounded Palestinians  to  
leave Gaza  roughly.  400 
Americans have  been  cleared 
to leave  have  through the 
rafah Crossing  from  Gaza  
over  to  Egypt.  So  again 
a lot of  developments  
coming  in  pretty  much  on  
an  hourly  basis.  We will 
continue to follow  all of  
these and bring you updates,  
right here  live  raw and 
unfiltered.
