“Good morning, Iran launched an attack on Israel
It has made more than 300 threats
The Iranian threat met the air superiority
And the technology of the IDF combined with a fighting coalition
A strong force that bribed the vast majority of threats
We were teasing
99% of the threats made to the state Israel is it
A strategic achievement
Very significant out of about 170 non-aircraft
Manned that a zero-lived Iran has penetrated the territory of the state
Dozens of Israel They were shot down by fighter planes
The Air Force's our air defense system
And our partners' defense and aircraft systems
Out More than 30 cruise missiles that Iran has launched
Minister Epps infiltrated the territory of the State of Israel 25 of them
They were shot down by fighter planes of the Air Force
Outside the country's borders of more than 120
Ballistic missiles. A few missiles penetrated
The land of Israel and the rest will be intercepted They're down
At the Air Force base in Nevatim and caused minor damage to the air force
The only nonsense as you can see
The base is functioning and continues to perform his duties
In the photo you can see the landing strip
At the base of sprouts
Thought you'd be able to paralyze the base and thus hit
Capabilities Our air force, but it failed
The planes continue to take off and land
Base surface and exit for attack missions
protection between them as well The mighty planes returning
Now from a base defense mission and you'll see
Them
Landing in addition to launching from Iran a number of mutsu
Launch from Iraqi territory And Yemen
None of them have entered Israeli territory in hours
The last sludge of gunfire from dozens of surface rockets
There is no North Lebanon Fighter planes are hit
They attacked targets in which they were carrying Hezbollah mobs throughout Lebanon
Radwan’s targets included this while many planes were flying
Others continue their mission Defense for six months
The last one we're working closely with
Our partners, first and foremost
Fyud is the center of the United Kingdom and France Army
And countries More
