request to release 40 living hostages the
Israeli media revealed this Thursday
that Israel could accepted the release
only 20 hostages in the first
phase of the agreement provided that this
or women of men's soldiers
over 50 and people
seriously sick the proposal
initial provided for the release of 40
hostages corresponding to these criteria but
Ramas said it did not hold
as much living hostage entering into
its categories
Shortly after this information the
same media have published statements
of an Israeli official, the latter has
insisted that it was not
not 20 but 33 hostages including
Women of the soldiers of the elderly
patients and injured concerning the
duration of the fire it will depend on the
number of hostages that will be released in
Effect the previous proposal
planned a 6 -week truce but
Due to the release of less
hostage this duration would be rac
Whether 20 or 33 hostages these
new proposals led the
Israeli war cabinet in
the dead end of other officials who do not
are not part of this cabinet react
Israel is humiliated again and again its
positions are raised what is only
push black sin to harden its requirements
and to remove the possibility of release
hostages now you should
Talk to Hamas by using shells
and bombs the ministers will have to
now decide to launch a
operation arafa or to continue the
negotiations to release the hostages a
such an agreement will allow a truce that
could also lead to a
Academy in northern Israel and avoid
Thus a major war with Hezbola
Due to this impasse a delegation
Egyptian should arrive this Friday
in Israel to discuss large
lines of this agreement
