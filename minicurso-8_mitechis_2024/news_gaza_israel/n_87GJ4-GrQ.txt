BONE CHILLING.
>> Todd: SPOOKY, IF YOU WILL.
>> Carley: SEE YOU SOON.
>> Todd: SMOKE RISING ABOVE THE 
GAZA SKYLINE AS ISRAEL EXPANDS 
GROUND FORCES.
>> Carley: ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
CHALLENGES IS THE ELABORATE 
TUNNEL SYSTEM.
CHRIS BANWAG IS A MARINE CORPS 
COLONEL WHO SERVED IN THE MIDDLE
EAST AND HE JOINS US NOW.
ISRAEL HAS INCREDIBLE 
TECHNOLOGY, BUT THERE ARE THOSE 
THAT SAY THE TUNNEL SYSTEM WILL 
NEUTRALIZE THAT.
HOW DO THEY NAVIGATE THIS 
SYSTEM?
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.
THE CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR IDF 
CANNOT BE OVERSTATED IN WORKING 
WITH THE IDF, I APPRECIATE HOW 
INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING THIS WILL
BE.
ONCE YOU GET THROUGH THE GAZA 
AREA AND INTO THIS, IT IS LIKE A
SECOND CITY UNDERGROUND 
AMPLIFIED.
THINK ABOUT SMALL SPACES AND 
UNKNOWN PATHWAY.
THERE IS NO NATURAL LIGHT.
RECALL LAST TIME YOU TRIED TO 
NAVIGATE YOUR OWN HOUSE IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITHOUT 
LIGHTS, THIS IS WHERE THEIR DAY 
BEGINS TALKING ABOUT TUNNEL 
WARFARE AND UNDERGROUND AREA 
THEY HAVE.
HAMAS CHOSE THIS BATTLE AND THEY
HAVE SHOWN THEIR BARBARISM.
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT 
OF TIME AND ABILITY THEY HAVE 
HAD TO PREPARE IT, NO LIMIT TO 
NUMBER OF TRAPS AND AMBUSHES 
THEY CAN PUT IN PLACE FOR THE 
IDF AND THEY HAVE SHOWN INTENT 
HO HURT ISRAELIS BEST THEY CAN.
>> Todd: THERE ARE REPORTS 
BUNKER BUSTING BOMBS ARE BEING 
USED.
THERE COULD ARE CASUALTIES OF 
YOUR OWN TROOPS AND HOSTAGES.
EXPLAIN WHY THEY WORK AND WHY 
THEY WILL BE UTILIZED.
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION.
WE HAVE USED SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY 
EARLY IN IRAQ.
YOU CAN SET DELAY ON THE FUSE OF
EXPLOSIVES SO THEY WILL GO TO 
THE DEPTH THEY NEED TO AND WHEN 
WE THINK ABOUT THE MATH AND 
SCIENCE THAT GOES INTO IT, THE 
TECHNOLOGY IS THERE FOR US TO BE
CAREFUL IN THE WAY WE'RE 
APPLYING THESE ORDINANCES.
THERE IS RISK TO ANYONE 
UNDERGROUND AND TROOPS IN THE 
AREA.
