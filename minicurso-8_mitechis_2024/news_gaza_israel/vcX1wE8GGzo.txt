WHEN IT COMES TO A GENERAL
ELECTION MATCHUP, HE IS NECK
AND NECK OF PRESIDENT BIDEN.
ALEX.
>> YEAH, YOU ARE, RIGHT THAT'S
HOW IT STANDS, AS OF.
NOW THANKS SO MUCH, HAPPY NEW
YEAR TO YOU, MY FRIEND.
IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE
BREAKING NEWS ON YET ANOTHER
CONFRONTATION ON U.S. SHIPS AND
A RADIANT BACK HOUTHI BOTH IN
THE RED SEA.
IT IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE
ATTACK SINCE THE TENSIONS
RAMPED UP A FEW MONTHS AGO.
NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT ERIC
GILCHRIST IS TRAVELING WITH THE
PRESIDENT.
HE'S JOINING ME FROM ST. CROIX.
ERIC, WHAT HAPPENED THERE?
>> ALEX, PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS
BRIEFED ON THE INCIDENT BY HIS
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER HERE
ON ST. CROIX.
AS WE UNDERSTAND OVER THE
PENTAGON, THIS WAS A CONTAINER
SHIP THAT WAS MOVING THROUGH
THE RED SEA WHEN FOR SMALL
HOUTHI BOATS MOVE TOWARD THE
SHIP.
THE REBELS ON THOSE BOATS
OPENED FIRE ON THE SHIP,
EXCHANGED GUNFIRE WITH SECURITY
FORCES ON THE SHIP BEFORE A
DISTRESS CALL WENT OUT, AND WAS
RESPONDED TO BY THE U.S. NAVY.
HELICOPTERS FROM THE NAVY MOVIE
TOWARDS THIS AREA, IN AN EFFORT
TO WARN OFF THE SHIPS, THOSE
REBELS OPENED FIRE ON THE NAVY
HELICOPTERS WITH SMALL ARMS AND
LARGER WEAPONS, ACCORDING TO
THE STATEMENT FROM SITCOM.
THESE HELICOPTERS RETURNED FIRE,
THEY WERE ABLE TO SINK THREE OF
THOSE FOUR SHIPS, AND KILL THE
REBELS ON BOARD.
THE FOUR SHIP WAS ABLE TO GET
AWAY.
BY OUR, COUNT THIS IS THE 24TH
ATTACK BY HOUTHI REBELS ON
SHIPPING LANES AND THE RED SEA
SINCE NOVEMBER 19TH.
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNCIL APPEARED AN
EMBASSY THIS MORNING IT WAS
ASKED WHETHER THE U.S. IS
CONSIDERING A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE
ON THESE HOUTHI BACKED,
IRAN-BACKED REBELS IN THE RED
SEA.
HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
>> WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE
HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT THIS.
WE'RE NOT RULING ANYTHING IN OR
OUT.
WE MADE CLEAR PUBLICLY TO THE
HOUTHIS, WE'VE MADE CLEAR
PRIVATELY TO OUR ALLIES AND
PARTNERS IN THE REGION, WE TAKE
THESE THREATS SERIOUSLY.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT
DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD.
>> THE SHIP WAS ACTUALLY, IT
CAME UNDER ATTACK YESTERDAY AS
WELL.
SO TWO ATTACKS IN TWO DAYS BY
THIS SHIP.
THAT SHIPPING COMPANY HAS SAID
THAT IT IS PAUSING ALL OF ITS
OPERATIONS THROUGH THE RED SEA
FOR AT LEAST 48 HOURS.
THE SECOND TIME IN A MONTH.
THE BIG CONCERN HERE, ALEX, IS
