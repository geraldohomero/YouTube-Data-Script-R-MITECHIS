right now
tragic I think the European Union must
Base your answer on four
Principles the
firmness the
humanity coherence and an attitude
policy
proactive against this
conflict firmness begins with
Clear condemnation of
Never to those who, as the
Minister cannot be identified with
The people of Palestine
For us it is never an organization
terrorist and well that has demonstrated it
With their actions the last days
Amás has been boycotting any
attempt to make peace has opposed
United Nations Resolutions
and from the Arab League that opened a path
For the possible peace agreement between
Israel and Palestine
You want to disappear Israel does not want
peace
wants the
destruction but is also doing
with their
impossible actions that the Palestinians
They also reach a fair peace
They are also victims of Hamas and that is why
We cannot hold everything responsible
The Palestinian people and all
Gaza inhabitants of the action
terrorist of
Amás firmness also goes for asking
The liberation of hostages and that
link with the second line of action
That is the
humanity wars also have their
Rules wars are atrocious and what
We have seen what we have explained
without knowing who to attribute the
authorship of the killing in that hospital is
Another of the horrible faces of the war
But wars also have their
rules and are coined in law
International and we have said it in several
occasions referred to other conflicts
Cut the water and basic supplies
of a population look how it is
measuring every word
Borrel condemn the terrorist group
Never ask Israel
proportionality look how you are looking
Each word and look like in the case of
Hospital has not entered the
responsibility this Europe that already has
A war doors
measuring every centimeter ignoring
still a fundamental point or not eh or
They are not ignoring it and they have it
in the head and that is that the great
harmed of the energy crisis by
guilt of what may happen in
Hormuz narrow is only one
Respect internal law by
