the Hamas Hamas is not a terrorist
organization but a Liberation group a
group of mujahidin that is fighting to
protect its soil and its
citizens dear brothers we had good
intentions but Israel took advantage of
our good intentions we had a plan to go
to Israel but it's canceled we did not
go if it had continued with good int
intentions our relations may have been
different but now unfortunately that
will not happen either because they took
advantage of our good intentions hey
Israel you may be an organization
because the West owes you a lot but
turkey owes you

nothing
Israel's attacks on Gaza both in terms
of those who carry them out and in terms
of those who support them are a
situation that signify both
murderousness and mental
illness we have no problem with the
Israeli state but we have never approved
and will never approve the cruelty it is
carrying out and its style of acting
like an organization instead of a
state first of all all sides need to
take their hands off the trigger and and
a cease fire needs to be declared at
once both Israel's attacks on Gaza and
other areas need to stop as well as the
missiles fired on Israeli soil direct or
indirect talks for the release of
hostages need to begin and this issue
needs to reach a conclusion
rapidly
in this picture the tears that Western
par shed for Israel while turning a
Blind Eye to the cruelty in Gaza is
nothing but the biggest example of fraud
for the war not to spread All actors
need to act responsibly and forces
outside the region need to stop carrying
fuel to the fire under the guise of
solidarity with Israel I call on all
other countries that have wisdom and a
conscience to put pressure on Nathan's
government for the Israeli state to
return to common sense I would like to
remind of the need to not continue these
developments with an understanding of
the Cross against the
presentent for for spee
