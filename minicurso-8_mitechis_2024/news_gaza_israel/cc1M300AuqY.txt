October her house struck her Studio gone
her Legacy remembered here at the

collection it's a national treasure a
month before the war Hiba asked to bring

together but now we need to paint and
survive some artists are painting now
from the street they've been displaced

a reminder that they're all one under
Israeli bombardment most are displaced
in similar tents next to one
another Dina mat has Vivid memories of
her visit to her destroyed home now
displaced to rafah she's still alive but
her memories are in Ruins because of the
canvas and the wood Unfortunately they
have used a lot of her work to be burnt
to warm themselves in such a miserable
condition diverse in nature color and
meaning behind every piece is a story of
Hope and pain with the Israeli military
occupation front and center some spaces
on the wall are waiting to be filled
with more paintings a chance to take
part in Collective G G and
Remembrance I think they are
stubborn they refuse to die and
certainly they refuse to die quietly
four artists participating in this
exhibition were killed during this war
on Gaza many other artists the museum
could not even reach an open exhibition
only to be closed after the war ends as
it drags on many warn these paintings
may be the only survivors of gaza's art
