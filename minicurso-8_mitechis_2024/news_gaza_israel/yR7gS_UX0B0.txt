A LAST-MINUTE DEAL, WHAT
DO WE GET OUT OF THESE
ADDITIONAL 24 HOURS?
>> WE GET TIME WITHOUT
HOSTILITIES RESUMING.
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
FOR THE CIVILIANS ON THE GROUND.
WE ALSO GET MORE TIME TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE
REMAINING HOSTAGES.
THE TRUCE WAS EXTENDED
BASICALLY LAST-MINUTE, LIKE
FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE 7:00
A.M. DEADLINE.
FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND, ISRAEL
AND HAMAS THROUGH EGYPT, THE
U.S.
AND QATAR WERE TALKING WAY INTO
THE NIGHT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
GET THIS DONE. THE U.S.
IS PUTTING IMMENSE PRESSURE ON
ISRAEL TO KEEP THE TALKS GOING,
WHILE EGYPT AND QATAR ARE
PRESSURING HAMAS TO DO THE SAME.
KRITI:
AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE A LOT
OF PUTTING PRESSURE ON THIS,
THERE WAS STORY ABOUT HOW SAUDI
ARABIA WAS WORKING WITH IRAN TO
COUNTERACT.
THE UNITED STATES A PART OF
THAT CONVERSATION, SPECIFICALLY
ANTONY BLINKEN, WHAT DID WE GET
OUT OF THAT VISIT?
>> BASICALLY YOU HAVE LEADERS
LIKE IN SAUDI ARABIA AND THE
U.S.
TRYING TO KEEP THINGS AS CALM
AS POSSIBLE.
IRAN THROUGH ITS PROXIES, SAUDI
IS BASICALLY TELLING IRAN TO
PLEASE TRY TO KEEP THINGS CALM.
WE HAVE SOME INCENTIVES FOR
YOUR ECONOMY, WHICH IS NOT
DOING SO WELL RIGHT NOW.
ON THE OTHERS, THE U.S.
WITH BLINKEN COMING FOR THE
THIRD TIME, IS TRYING TO PUT
PRESSURE ON ISRAEL THAT WHEN
HOSTILITIES RESUMED, YOU HAVE A
MORE TARGETED, FOCUSED SEEKING
OUT OF HAMAS LEADERS.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EXPECTS
THERE TO BE AN EVENT LIKE A
NEVER ENDING CEASEFIRE.
WHAT YOU HAVE IS ALL THESE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED FROM THE
NORTH PART OF GAZA TO THE SOUTH.
YOU HAVE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
RIGHT NOW AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING
TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING A
HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE.
