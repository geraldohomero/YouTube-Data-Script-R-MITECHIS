because aid is not an entitlement donald
trump's senior advisor and son-in-law
jared kushner says he knows a middle
east peace plan won't work without
political solutions but that he intends
to deal with those at a later stage
people are tired
of the way this has been stuck in the
mud for so long and what we're hoping we
can do is get people to look at this a
little bit differently
come together share ideas and then
hopefully we can create a framework
on which to move forward economically
his proposal set to be the focus of
meetings in manama this week between the
u.s and arab gulf states includes 50
billion dollars for economic projects a
west bank gaza corridor and tourism in
palestine
but palestinian officials protesters and
west bank residents are demanding a
political solution
saying the biggest obstacles to peace
are the problems the deal does not
address
naji tamimi who heads the village
council for the west bank town of nabi
saleh says he's distressed by a nearby
illegal israeli settlement
they attack the local people and their
properties the army is always with them
and carries out attacks on local
palestinians with them
many times they've closed off the
village arrested people conducted
nighttime house raids killed locals and
seized land
others are worried the money will
further distance them
from their rights and their land like
abdul karim al-jabari who lives in wadi
al-hussein near hebron
his village is surrounded by three
israeli settlements
came to me and told me to ask for any
amount i want and move anywhere i want
in exchange for selling my land in my
home
he's one of many west bank residents
saying the only way they'll leave is on
the way to their graves
despite kushner's confidence his peace
deal may end up stuck in the mud if it
doesn't include a solution that enables
palestinians to stay put
