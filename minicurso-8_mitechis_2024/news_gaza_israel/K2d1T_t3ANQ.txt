bassador sir the fact that there has
been a massive attack by the Hamas into
Israeli territory unprecedented they
entered Israeli territory
captured uh a lot of the civilians and
soldiers and also killed a lot give us
context of the attack itself and the
fact that uh this is maybe the first
breach in a long time of intelligence of
these of the Israeli
forces let me say that what has happened
from Hamas is reaction of what the
Israelis are doing in West Bank
mainly maybe the people of India they
don't know that the Israelis from the
beginning of this year have killed
20260 uh civilian people in West Bank
and every day they are attack the cities
today they attack the city of tubas as
an example and they are still there we
don't know how many one will killed
yesterday they killed seven people
different than the
260 people they have killed and I'm
talking about West Bank they attacking
Al AA every every day and they attack
the people even who is just coming to
watch those settlers who invade Al AA
thousands of them every day this is very
sensitive place so uh I think the
occupation is the main reason
of what is going on in these days if
it's from Hamas or from uh the Israelis
themselves this War I think personally
in
2001 I made many
interviews and I mention at that time
and I warn if you did not find a
solution to the Palestinian cause uh we
will see one more uh War and two three
Wars uh the International Community is
responsible for that they have should
come to the international law the
Palestinian have uh more than 800
resolution in the United Nation between
Security Council and general assembly
Israel has never been implemented for
one resolution so uh again we hope this
war will end quickly we don't want to
see any civilian killed we don't want to
see anyone of the Palestinian of or the
Israel is killed in the occupation and
we will live as brother
