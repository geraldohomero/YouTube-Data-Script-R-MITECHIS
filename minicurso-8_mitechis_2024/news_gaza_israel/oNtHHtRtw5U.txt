hello everyone i'd like to begin
by addressing what unfolded in
washington dc this week
what we witnessed was an assault on
democracy
by violent rioters incited by the
current president
and other politicians as shocking
deeply disturbing and frankly saddening
as that event remains we've also seen
this week
that democracy is resilient in america
our closest ally and neighbor violence
has no place in our societies and
extremists will not
succeed in overruling the will of the
people
as canadians i think we've been all
reflecting on our own country
something i spoke with the premiers
about last night
about the fact that democracy is not
automatic
it takes work every day about
what a real accomplishment it is to
maintain a political system
in which the losing side gracefully
concedes
and in which rival political parties
between elections
work together for the common good
we have this in canada because canadians
make it possible canadians expect
their political leaders to protect our
precious democracy
by how we conduct ourselves we've seen
this
manifest in unanimous consent in our
parliament for our main
kovid fighting measures at a time when
the government holds a minority of seats
we see it in the cooperation between the
federal government and
provincial and territorial governments
regardless
of political stripe canadians
expect debate debate in service of
all canadians debate that is grounded in
a shared acceptance
of the facts in a diverse country
there will always be diverse
perspectives and it is through
respect for those differences that we
create
a stronger canada canadian democracy
didn't happen by accident and it won't
continue
without work we must always work to
secure our democracy
and not give comfort to those who
promote things that are not true
or give space for hatred or extremism
