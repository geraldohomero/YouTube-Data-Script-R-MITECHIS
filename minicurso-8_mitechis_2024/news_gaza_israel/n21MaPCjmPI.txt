starvation is closing in on residents
here in the Northern parts of the Gaza
Strip as the Israeli occupation forces
continue to deny them the delivery of a
drop of any relief Aid families mostly
children line up for hours and hours to
get their hands on some soup or a
handful of rice this is now a daily
practice in the Northern parts of the
strip children are devoured by hunger no
matter how much the quantities of Aid to
be delivered these cannot meet the
residents dying need for
food we come here every day hoping to
lay our hands on any food for our
children we run out of flour and all

injury is that we are left without any
