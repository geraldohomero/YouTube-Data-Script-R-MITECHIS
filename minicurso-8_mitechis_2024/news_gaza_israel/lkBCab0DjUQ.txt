>> Steve: COLLEGE STUDENT SAYS 
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HOLE 
RALLIES AND GIVE STATEMENTS 
AGAINST ISRAEL BLAMING ISRAEL 
FOR THE DEADLY ATTACKS BY HAMAS.
ONE BERKELEY LAW PROFESSOR SAYS 
ADULTS NEED TO STEP IN.
DON'T HIRE MY ANTISEMITISM LAW 
STUDENTS, URGING LAW FIRMS AND 
COMPANIES TO STOP HIRING 
STUDENTS WHO DON'T CONDEMN 
TERRORISM.
PROFESSOR STEVEN SOLOMON JOINS 
US NOW.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
WHY DID YOU WRITE THIS GREAT OP 
ED IN THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" 
ABOUT DON'T HIRE MY ANTISEMITISM
LAW STUDENT?
>> YOU DON'T NEED A GRADUATE 
DEGREE TO KNOW YOU SHOULD NOT 
INN DORSE HATE AND MURDER AND 
THE MASSACRE IN ISRAEL WAS 
HORRIFIC.
FOR LAW SCHOOL EMPLOYERS, IF 
YOUR STUDENTS YOU ARE HIRING TO 
REPRESENT YOUR CLIENTS, ADVOCATE
HATE AND MURDER AND 
ANTISEMITISM, DON'T HIRE THEM, 
YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO REPRESENT
YOUR CLIENTS OR BE PART OF YOUR 
GROUP.
>> Steve: AT YOUR SCHOOL, LAW 
STUDENTS FOR JUSTICE IN 
PALESTINIAN VOTED TO BAN ANY 
PRO-ISRAELI SPEAKER FROM ANY 
EVENTS AT COLLEGE.
WHAT MESSAGE DID THAT SEND?
>> THEY DID MORE THAN THAT, THEY
SAID ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN AN 
ISRAELI STATE SHOULD NOT BE 
ALLOWED TO SPEAK.
AS JEWS AND I'M JEWISH, THIS IS 
OUR HOMELAND AND IDENTITY.      
THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING
TO ALLOW JEWS IN OUR 
ORGANIZATION.
EVEN OUR DEAN SAID, THIS WOULD 
                              
PREVENT ME FROM SPEAKING.
IT TREATS JEWS AS DIFFERENT, IT 
IS DISCRIMINATION AND LAW 
STUDENTS SHOULD KNOW BETTER.
>> Steve: INDEED.
LAST WEEK, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 
LAW STUDENT HAD A JOB RESCINDED 
FROM WINSTON AND STRAUN, BECAUSE
OF A STATEMENT SUPPORTING HAMAS 
AND IT WAS VERY ANTI-RAL 
ISRAELI.
YOU THINK A LAW FIRM SHOULD ASK 
ABOUT A STUDENT'S BACKGROUND, 
RIGHT?
>> I THINK THEY DO ALREADY.
THIS IS NOT ASKING TO DO MORE 
THAN YOU DO ALREADY.
YOU WOULDN'T HIRE SOMEONE WHO 
DISCRIMINATES AFRICAN AMERICANS,
YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE LAW STUDENTS
WHO ENDORSE AND ADVOCATE A 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT HAS 
MURDERED PEOPLE.
