Assistance and Evacuation of Citizens
Indonesia which is currently in Gaza
is in Palestine Area
Palestine that I want to ask is
underline when the mother of the Foreign Minister gave a speech
at the general session of the UN Council yesterday
only that ee sir can convey related
that's right I want to convey
Actually, why did Mrs. Menlu choose
Reading poetry like that was okay when on
When at Monas it showed that
everything to do is already
done all done
Everything to say is also
has been spoken so in a month
Last so it became
Ee what is the name

as stated by Mr. E Teku
Rezaah earlier that finally only by
Because one country whose name is
Memvito all processes and this shows
that
eh the UN is the hope of all of us
have failed many times to
shows the leadership has failed
when showing the leadership on
moment
eh what is the name eh Pandemi Covid and
even now eh failed to show
take a firm attitude to
Complete the humanitarian tragedy
still ongoing in Palestine
Despite eh what kind of name
existing leaders
in the world not only and this is not
Cross religion he nations
Muslims who are non-Muslims
all voiced the same thing
express the same concern
regarding the humanitarian situation but
We see that until now not much
things that can be done to be election

shows how frustrating it
situation with the Palestinian nation
this and we emphasize the commitment that
as stated by the founder
Our nation Bung Karno that

Perfect without Palestinian independence
This means we will always stand together
Palestinians both the government and
Indonesia as a nation
