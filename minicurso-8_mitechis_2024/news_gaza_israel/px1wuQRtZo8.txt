>> WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE FOR THE
FAMILIES?
>> HANG IN THERE.
WE'RE COMING.
>> JOINING US NOW IS MOSHA.
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS KIDNAPPED
BY HAMAS.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FAMILY ON
THE 7th OF OCTOBER?
>> I WAS BORN AND RAISED AT THE
GAZA BORDER.
I MOVED TO NEW YORK IN
SEPTEMBER.
FOR MY FAMILY, OCTOBER 7th WAS
HELL.
BOTH MY PARENTS AND MY OTHER
SISTER EXPERIENCED IT.
BUT THE MOST TRAGIC EVENT
HAPPENED TO MY MIDDLE SISTER.
HAMAS TERRORISTS BROKE INTO
THEIR HOME, TORTURED THEM,
ABUSED THEM, GROUPED THEM WITH
ANOTHER FAMILY WHOSE TEENAGE
GIRL WAS EXECUTED BY HAMAS AND
EVENTUALLY SEPARATED MY SISTER
WITH HER HUSBAND.
WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM SINCE
OCTOBER 7th.
MY SISTER AND TWO BABY NIECES
SURVIVED THE TRAGEDY, WERE
RESCUED BEFORE HAMAS COULD TAKE
THEM.
BUT HE IS HELD HOSTAGE IN THE
GAZA STRIP.
>> YOU DESCRIBED SUCH HORROR.
I'M WONDERING, FIRST OF ALL, ARE
THE CHILDREN AND YOUR SISTER,
ARE THEY -- HOW ARE THEY DOING
TODAY?
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT US TO
KNOW ABOUT WHAT TODAY'S RALLY IS
ALL ABOUT?
>> WE COME FROM A STRONG FAMILY,
A STRONG WORKING CLASS FAMILY.
MY SISTER IS STRONG AND HAS BEEN
SPEAKING TO EVERYONE WILLING TO
LISTEN FOR THE RELEASE OF HER
HUSBAND.
BUT SHE'S DEFINITELY ENDURED
SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA.
MY TWO BABY NIECES, ONLY 2 YEARS
OLD AND 7 MONTHS OLD HAS
EXPERIENCED SOMETHING NO CHILD
SHOULD EXPERIENCE WITH GUNS
POINTED AT HER FACE, CALLING FOR
HER DADDY TO RETURN HOME EVERY
NIGHT.
WE ARE HERE.
I'M GLAD TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE
HERE IN SUPPORT OF RETURNING THE
HOSTAGES HOME.
THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE OF BEING
PRO-ISRAELI.
THISITARIAN ISSUE.
CIVILIANS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN
FROM THEIR HOME OR TORTURED IN
THEIR HOME.
I'M HERE TO CALL FOR THE RELEASE
OF THE HOSTAGES UNCONDITIONALLY.
THAT'S MY MESSAGE TO EVERYONE
WILLING TO LISTEN, BRING THEM
HOME NOW, BRING MY
