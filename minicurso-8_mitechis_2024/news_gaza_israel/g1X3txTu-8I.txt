WE'LL TALK ABOUT TESLA WITH 
THESE LOSSES PILING UP. 
>> ISRAEL THE STORY OF THE
MORNING RETALIATING AGAINST 
IRAN'S DRONE AND MISSILE ATTACK 
ON ITS TERRITORY ALMOST A WEEK
AGO.
BACK TO RICHARD ENGEL FOR THE 
LATEST IN JERUSALEM.
HI, RICHARD.
>> Reporter: GOOD TO BE WITH YOU
AGAIN.
SO ISRAEL RETALIATED
THIS HAS BEEN A SERIES OF 
RETALIATIONS OVER THE LAST
COUPLE OF WEEKS.
FIRST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
MONTH ON APRIL 1st, IRAN CARRIED
OUT AN ATTACK, ISRAEL CARRIED 
OUT AN ATTACK ON THE IRANIAN
EMBASSY IN SYRIA
LAST WEEKEND, WE SAW THAT ATTACK
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK BY IRAN
AGAINST ISRAEL AND ISRAEL 
RESPONDED.
BUT IN A VERY LIMITED WAY AND 
THE KEY THING IS, IT SEEMS LIKE 
BOTH SIDES NOW ARE TRYING TO
DEESCALATE, TRYING TO PULL BACK 
FROM THE BRINK
AND THE REASON THAT IT SEEMS
OBVIOUS IS, HERE IN ISRAEL JUST 
A FEW HOURS AFTER THIS MILITARY 
STRIKE, ON A MILITARY BASE
INSIDE IRAN, JUST OUTSIDE THE

THE MILITARY HAS NOT ISSUED ANY

THE AIRPORT IS OPEN, THE AIR
SPACE IS OPEN, AND IN IRAN, 
SIGNIFICANTLY, IRAN HAD BEEN
SAYING FROM THE PRESIDENT ON

WILL RESPOND FEROCIOUSLY AND
IMMEDIATELY.
IRANIAN STATE MEDIA ARE 
DOWNPLAYING IT AND BRUSHING IT
OFF PRESENTING IT AS A WIN
SAYING THE ONLY REASON THAT 
ISRAEL CARRIED OUT SUCH A 
LIMITED STRIKE, AND IT DOES 
APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN LIMITED IN
SCALE, THAT IT IS BECAUSE IRAN
BE INTIMIDATED ISRAEL SO MUCH 
WITH ITS LAST STRIKE THE PAST 
WEEKEND.
WE SEEM TO BE A PHASE WHERE BOTH
SIDES ARE TRYING TO STEP BACK.
BOTH SIDES ARE ABLE TO CLAIM A
BIT OF VICTORY AND THAT IS A
POTENTIALLY POSITIVE SIGN IN THE
REGION AND LEADERS I'M SPEAKING 
TO, INCLUDING SENIOR OFFICIALS
IN GOVERNMENTS AROUND ISRAEL, 
ARE WATCHING WITH A DEGREE OF 
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM, PERHAPS WE 
ARE PULLING BACK FROM THE BRINK 
OF A REGIONAL WAR, A BRI
