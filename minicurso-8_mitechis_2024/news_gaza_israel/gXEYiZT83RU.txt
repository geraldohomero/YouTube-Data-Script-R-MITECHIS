now after 48 days in
captivity what's next for this bus we
are not sure the next several

these hostages the isra hostages at
least made it to the they were going to
try facilitate a phone call with their
family members they weren't able to
immediately be reunited with
themed have that have that first
conversation with a loved one that they
have not been able to have for so
