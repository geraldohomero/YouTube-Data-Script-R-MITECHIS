In this Israel war he usually attacks
assets and groups backed by
They will go to Lebanon and Syria and Iran has not
responded with retaliation to greater
scale but the Israeli attack of the
April First in Sovereign Territory
and Iran diplomat in his embassy in
Damascus makes a difference its leader
Supreme Ayatollah Jamenei says that
Israel must be and will be punished Iran
You must answer not to be weak but
The question is how and can avoid tour
Middle East in a Great War
The most obvious option is to resort to
the groups that support Iran for example
Iran Financia trains weapon and in a certain
measure controls the Uí in Shemen
They have two ballistic missiles and could
have three cruise missiles capable of
Reach Israel in fact have been
launching these missiles in Israel from
On October 7 but they are not rival for
Israel's aerial defenses or could
resort to militias in Iraq as
Axa with short ballistic missiles
100 km reach also have
Turned to Irat in southern Israel
But we already know that aerial defenses
Israel are almost impenetrable
Hizbullah in southern Lebanon is
group with more missiles approximately
150,000 some long range and
powerful like the Kaibar 1 and Fate 110
however it is believed that Iran wants
save that arsenal as insurance before a
possible attack by Israel to his supposed
nuclear facilities and in front of
difficulties of attacking these groups
Some analysts suspect that they will go
will directly attack Israel
has a missile arsenal
long range and drones that could use
To attack whites from the high
Golán to Tel Avib and even bases
Military throughout the country others
options could be an attack
Cybernetic an offensive in embassies
Israelis or against Israelis and tourists
abroad so far Iran has
shown moderation to avoid war
major regional because it does not have power
military needed to sustain one and
Whether the ayatollah and his advisors
are surely a
retaliation designed carefully to
respond to the Israeli attack of the
Embassy but without causing a war
regional large -scale but it is possible
that what happens next with the
Israeli American armies and
others on maximum alert throughout the region
make the situation unmanageable and
immersed the Middle East in a conflict
devastating and on a larger scale
