SENATOR LINDSAY GRAHAM OF SOUTH
CAROLINA.
WELCOME BACK TO "MEET THE
PRESS".
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I.
I WANT TO START WITH ISRAEL.
I WANT TO START WITH HOW HE
RESPONSED TO MSNBC'S JONATHAN
CAPEHART ABOUT THE HOT MIKE
MOMENT WHERE HE WILL HAVE A COME
TO JESUS MOMENT WITH PRESIDENT
NETANYAHU.
>> HE'S HURTING, IN MY VIEW
BEING HE'S HURTING ISRAEL MORE
THAN HELPING ISRAEL BY MAKING
THE REST OF THE WORLD, IT'S
CONTRARY TO WHAT HE STANDS FOR
AND I THINK IT'S A BIG MISTAKE.
>> DO YOU AGREE THAT PRIME
MINISTER NETANYAHU IS HURTING
ISRAEL BY NOT DOING MORE TO
ADDRESS THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.
>> NO, I DON'T.
I WOULD LIKE TO HELP THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, WHEN THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
TALKS ABOUT BIBI AND NOT HAMAS
WE'RE MISSING THE BOAT HERE.
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT RED
LINES AGAINST IRAN.
ISRAEL IS NOT KILLING AMERICAN
SOLDIERS AND IRAN IS THROUGH
THEIR PROXIES.
HEIR HOLDING IRAN ACCOUNTABLE
FOR KILLING SOLDIERS AND
ATTACKING SHIPPING.
WE SHOULD BE ALL IN AND HELPING
ISRAEL.
WE SHOULD TRY TO HELP THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, BUT DON'T
SAY OR DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD
EMPOWER THE ENEMY.
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN DOES SPEND A
LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT HAMAS
AND THE ISSUE HERE IS THERE NOT
MORE THAT ISRAEL CAN DO TO HELP
THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS FOR
THEIR OWN PORT?
>> STAY TUNED IN THAT AREA.
I THINK ISRAEL WILL BE COMING UP
WITH SOME RELIEF IDEAS, BUT THE
LINE THAT STRUCK ME THE MOST IN
THE STATE OF THE UNION, HE TOLD
HAMAS IF YOUIO RELEASE THE
HOSTAGES THE WAR WILL BE OVER.
IS THE PRESIDENT SAYING IF THE
HOSTAGES ARE RELEASED THEY CAN
STAY IN POWER AND THAT ENDS THE
CONFLICT?
PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES IT'S
NON-NEGOTIABLE WHEN IT COMES TO
HAMAS.
THEY HAVE TO BE DESTROYED AND
CAN'T BE IN CHARGE.
I'M CHALLENGING THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION TODAY TO CLEAR
THIS UP.
YOU CANNOT ALLOW HAMAS TO STAY
IN POWER.
YOU CAN'T ALLOW THEM TO HAVE SIX
BRIG
BRIGADES AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A
NONE-NO NEGOTIABLE POLICY WITH
HAMAS.
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN DOES STAND
BEHIND THAT.
>> AND THE WAR IS OVER IF HE
