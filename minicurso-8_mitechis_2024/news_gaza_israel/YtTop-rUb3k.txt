>>> TO MATT, FIRST, TELL US
>>> TO MATT, FIRST, TELL US
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS OFFER
FROM ISRAEL.
>> WE HAVEN'T HEARD A RESPONSE
FROM HAMAS YET.
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS
AGREED UPON ABOUT 10 DAYS AGO
BY ISRAELI OFFICIALS.
IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THEY WILL
SAY.
REMEMBER, THESE HAVE BEEN
STALLED FOR MONTHS.
THEY WANT TO SEE A COMPLETE
CEASE-FIRE.
THIS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT.
THIS IS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD IF
HAMAS APPROVES THIS.
THIS WOULD BE THE LONGEST
STRETCH OF PEACE THE GAZA STRIP
HAS SEEN RELATIVELY SINCE
OCTOBER 7th.
IF THIS GOES FORWARD, IT WOULD
ALSO BE A BIG ROOM TO BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU.
JUST THIS MORNING, WE SAW
FAMILIES RATING  AS THE FINANCE
COMMITTEE MEETING, DEMANDED
THAT THE GOVERNMENT DO MORE TO
RELEASE THE HOSTAGES.
THERE IS MASSIVE FRUSTRATION
HERE THAT THESE HOSTAGES THAT
ARE STILL IN GAZA HAVE NOT BEEN
RELEASED DESPITE MONTHS OF
BLISTERING FIGHTING THAT HAS
NOW KILLED MORE THAN 25 THOUSAND
PALESTINIANS, MOST OF THEM
CIVILIANS.
THIS WOULD ALSO KIND OF
RESTRICT ISRAEL'S MOVEMENT HERE.
PART OF THIS WOULD INVOLVE
REDEPLOYING THEM OUTSIDE OF THE
POPULATION CENTERS IN THE GAZA
STRIP.
THAT WOULD KIND OF TIE THEIR
HANDS.
THIS DOES COME AT AN IDEAL
MOMENT FOR THEM.
THEY HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO TRY
TO SCALE THIS DOWN IN THE GAZA
STRIP TO MAKE MORE SURGICAL
MOVES AGAINST HAMAS.
THEY ARE STILL VERY CAPABLE.
RECENTLY, THEY LOST ABOUT 20%
OF THEIR FIGHTERS.
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OTHER
PIECE OF BREAKING NEWS.
THERE ARE STRIKES GOING ON
RIGHT NOW FROM THE U.S. AND UK,
TARGETS IN YEMEN.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?
>> YES.
THIS IS THE SECOND ROUND OF
STRIKE BY THE BRITISH AND THE
U.S. THEY'VE BEEN CAUSING A LOT
OF THOSE SHIPS TO BRING LOOSE.
AND IT COULD EVENTUALLY BE SEEN
IN PRICE TAGS IN THE UNITED
STATES.
STATES.
AGAIN, WE HEARD FROM THE HOUTHI
SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH
THEY BOMB THEM,  THEY WILL
STILL CONTINUE THEIR FIGHT
AGAINST ISRAEL.
AGAIN, WE ARE SEEING A MOVE BY
THE WEST, BY ISRAEL, THE U.S.,
AND IN THIS CASE, BY THE U.S.
AND THE UK.
