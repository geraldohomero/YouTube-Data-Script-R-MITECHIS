NOT SHARE THE VIEWS OF HAMAS AND
HEZBOLLAH.
STUART: DAVID AVELLA WITH ME
NOW.
CLOSE TO AMERICA BEING INVOLVED
IN A WIDER WAR.
WILL REPUBLICANS SUPPORT THAT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR
ALLY IS SAFE AND TRYING TO BRING
STABILITY BACK TO THE MIDDLE
EAST AND THE OVERALL PICTURE,
STUART, YOU KNOW, KEEP IN MIND
IT IS RARE THAT A PRESIDENT FROM
A POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE GETS TO
PICK THE ENVIRONMENT THAT HE
RUNS IN, AND WE'RE SEEING
PRESIDENT BIDEN IS GOING TO FACE
THE SAME THING THAT NOW NATIONAL
SECURITY BECOMES A MUCH BIGGER
ISSUE AS WE ROLL INTO THE 2024
ELECTIONS AS MORE AMERICANS NOT
ONLY AT HOME NOW FEEL THE TUG OF
THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY BEING AT
THREAT, BUT NOW EVEN
INTERNATIONALLY.
WE HAVE SOME CAUSES FOR CONCERN
AS YOU'VE POINTED THEM OUT OUT
AT THE TOP OF YOUR HOUR.
STUART: LET'S EXTEND THIS FOR A
MOMENT.
WOULD THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
SUPPORT AMERICAN TROOPS BOOTS ON
THE GROUND?
NOT FLYING JETS OFF CARRIER TO
ATTACK REMOTE TARGETS, BUT BOOTS
ON THE GROUND FIGHTING DIRECTLY
WITH HAMAS OR HEZBOLLAH.
WOULD THE REPUBLICANS SUPPORT
THAT?
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
REPUBLICANS FOR IT AND
REPUBLICANS AGAINST IT.
THE KEY HERE, STUART, IS HAVING
REPUBLICAN LEADERS GO TO THE
PRESIDENT AND TO THE SECRETARY
OF DEFENSE AND STATE AND FBI AND
CIA AND SAY WHAT DO YOU NEED TO
WIN THIS WAR?
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KEEP
AMERICANS SAFE HERE AT HOME?
THAT'S WHERE REPUBLICANS SHOULD
BE, AND SEE WHERE IT GOES.
SEE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S
PLANS ARE AND LET'S KEEP MANY
MIND, TOO, THAT THE PRESIDENT
AND HIS CABINET ARE IN CHARGE OF
EXECUTING POLICY, BUT IT
REQUIRES AN ACT OF CONGRESS TO
DECLARE A WAR SO THIS IS A TIME
WHEN HOUSE LEADERS AND SENATE
LEADERS AND THE PRESIDENT NEED
TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE.
STUART: YOU THINK IT MIGHT COME
TO THAT, AN ACTUAL DECLARATION
OF WAR REQUIRED?
>> WELL, JUST IN THE LARGER
SCOPE OF WHAT IS GOING ON,
STUART, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS
IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO GO, THE
POINT BEING IS THAT ULTIMATELY
THE CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HAVE
TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE AND
REPUBLICAN LEEREDS GOING TO THE
PRESIDENT SAYING WHAT'S THE PLAN
AND WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US?
STUART: GOT IT.
DAVID, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
THIS MORNING.
