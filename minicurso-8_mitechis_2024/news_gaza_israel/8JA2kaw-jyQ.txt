SEVEN-DAY COMING UP.
>> THANK YOU. NOW TO BREAKING
NEWS, ISRAEL BATTLES HAMAS FOR
A SECOND DAY AFTER A SURPRISE
ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL.
>> UNDERSTOOD HADS OF ISRAELS
HAVE BEEN KILLED, INCLUDING
CIVILIANS AND THOUSANDS WOUNDED
IN THE DEADLIEST DAY OF
VIOLENCE, ISRAEL HAS SEEN IN
HALF A CENTURY. CBS 2'S BRADLEY
BLACKBURN HAS MORE ON THE
THE UNITED STATES IS
RESPONDING. BRADLEY.
>> DOUG, ANDREA, YESTERDAY'S
ATTACK HAPPENED NEARLY 50 YEARS
TO THE DAY OF ANOTHER SURPRISE
WAR AGAINST ISRAEL. THE 1973
YOM KIPPUR WAR. OVERNIGHT
SUNDAY, ISREALI FORCES FOUGHT
BACK. EXPLOSIONS SHAKING GAZA
IN THE EARLY MORNING, LESS THAN
24 HOURS AFTER WAR BROKE OUT.
AT DAWN SATURDAY, ON A JEWISH
HOLIDAY, THE PALESTINIAN
MILITANT GROUP LAUNCHED
THOUSANDS OF ROCKETS FROM GAZA
INTO ISRAEL AND LAUNCHED AN
INVASION AT THE BORDER,
BREAKING THROUGH FENCES AND
ATTACKING BY SEA. IN SOME
TOWNS, MILITANTS SPARKED GUN
BATTLES AND AN UNKNOWN NUMBER
OF ISREALI CIVILIANS AND
SOLDIERS WERE SEIZED AND TAKEN
INTO GAZA.
>> VERY SCARY SITUATION. YOU
KNOW, MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED
ALREADY AND WE HEAR ABOUT
PEOPLE BEING KIDNAPPED.
>> OVERNIGHT, THE ROCKET
STRIKES FROM GAZA CONTINUED.
THIS ISREALI HOSPITAL IN A
COASTAL CITY TOOK A DIRECT HIT.
>> WE ARE JUST NOW TRYING TO
EVALUATE THE DAMAGES. THIS HAS
BEEN A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
DAY.
>> ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER SAID
HIS COUNTRY IS AT WAR AND
PROMISE TO WIN IT. ON SATURDAY,
PRESIDENT BIDEN SPOKE TO
NETANYAHU BY PHONE. THERE ARE
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW ISREALI
INTELLIGENCE MISSED THIS
THREAT, BUT THE COUNTER ATTACK
IS UNDERWAY. AIR STRIKES TOOK
OUT A 14 STORY BUILDING
BELIEVED TO HOUSE HAMAS OFFICES
AND ISREALI ARMY RESERVES HAVE
BEEN MOBILIZED FOR A RENEWED
CONFLICT THAT MAY JUST BE
GETTING STARTED. THIS MORNING,
MAJOR AIRLINES HAVE CANCELED
FLIGHTS INTO ISRAEL'S LARGEST
AIRPORT BECAUSE OF THE DANGER
IN THE SKIES. UNITED, AMERICAN,
AND DELTA ALL SAY THEY ARE
MONITORING THE SITUATION
CLOSELY AND DOUG AND ANDREA,
