before the Israel Hamas Conflict Relationship
Between Western countries and Iran
A little improved in September America
The union approved the exchange of prisoners
with Iran and released 6 billion dollars
Iranian assets are recorded but with
Hamas militant attack on Israel on 7
October this fund is then frozen again
There was room for direct negotiations
Towards the end of October between Iran
and the us in Oman but that I think is
now completely off the box
Eng Count Negotiations in Austria
to revive the agreement
Nuclear in 2015 did not produce results
Although the US or Iran did not state
The agreement has been fully buried
After the US withdraws from the agreement
Iran's nuclear in 2018 Iran is no longer
keep his commitment to the agreement
according to the Atomic Power Agency
International under the auspices of the United Nations IA EA
Iran is back to enriching uranium
although enrichment is carried out to the level
60% purity is still below the level
purity of about 90% required
to make an Iranian nuclear weapon
also attracts IAEA monitoring equipment
and block inspection by the United Nations
Part of the Escatory Understanding
Between Iran and the US Iran Stoppped
accumulating additional 60% andrich
uranium well that might now
Despite the leader of Rael Gross
stated that there was no conflict indication
Israel Hamas has an impact on the program
nuclear Iran but analysts recognize Iran
can use the nuclear program
to attract concessions from the west at
in the middle of increasing tension in the region
I can imagine them looking for ways of
Increasing Concern and Anxiety in The
West about their Nuclear Program BUT
stopping short of actually shall we say
crossing the line and ceasing to be in
Compliance with the nuclear
Israeli Non-Proliferation Treat has been
said he would not let Iran
Developing Israeli Nuclear Weapons
itself is said to have an atomic weapon
although not allowing inspection by
IAEA from Washington DC Nova Purwadi and
