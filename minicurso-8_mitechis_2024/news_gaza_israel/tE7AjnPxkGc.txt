israel has reportedly warned hundred of
citizens to leave immediately turkey to
leave turkey immediately this is due to
an apparent threat from iran which has
blamed israel for the recent
assassination of a senior iranian
revolutionary guard officer our
correspondent jody cohen has sent us
this report to take a look
according to reports syed kodai helped
to lead an iranian force that carries
out kidnappings and assassinations
outside of iran including of israelis he
himself was assassinated last week and
iran has vowed to take revenge
on monday iranian media published a list
of five wanted israeli intelligence and
technology experts who are apparently
being surveyed by iran as well as their
colleagues and even their families
and in the latest israeli officials have
reportedly telephoned 100 israeli
civilians in turkey to advise them to
return to israel as they could also be
at risk
this followed a travel warning for
turkey from israel's national security
council which suggested that there is a
concrete threat to israelis from iranian
terrorist operatives in turkey as well
as in nearby countries
recently the mossad has reportedly
foiled attempts to target israeli
figureheads consular staff and business
people around the world and now iran is
apparently widening its target aiming
for israeli tourists as well
the threats come amid a stalled iran
nuclear deal with israel believing the
deal won't prevent iran from achieving
nuclear weapons according to the un
nuclear watchdog the iaea on monday
iran's enriched uranium stockpile is 18
times over the 2015 deal limit
all israelis remaining in turkey have
been advised to stay vigilant avoid
contact with strangers and not give out
personal information or even publicly
show they are israeli turkey which is
warming ties with israel following a
landmark recent visit there by its
foreign minister is apparently not happy
about the travel warning but is hoping
that by publicizing the threat and
taking preventative security steps the
threats will pass quickly this is jody
cohen for we on world as one
