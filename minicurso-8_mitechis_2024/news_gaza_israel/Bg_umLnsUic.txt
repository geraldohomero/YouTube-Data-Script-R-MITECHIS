seven months since the beginning of the
great match of return which was first
launched from here the malika camp on
the 30th of march 2018 on what was
referred to as land day and was supposed
to end on may 15 when palestinians
commemorate what they refer to as nakba
or catastrophe the day that israel
announced its independence on
palestinian occupied lands
the idea of the protest was originally
conceived by gaza journalists and
activist ahmed aburatima after a viral
facebook post where he wondered saying
what would happen if two hundred
thousand peaceful protesters broke
through the barbed wire fence raised the
palestinian flag and pitched tents a few
kilometers into our own occupied
territory soon after this post community
activists began planning what they refer
to as the great march of return
the protest expresses two main demands
for the palestinians the first the
rights of refugees to return to their
lands and lands of ancestors that were
occupied in 1948 the second the breakage
of the 12 years israeli imposed siege
and blockade on the gaza strip
protest tents are set in five main camp
locations across the gaza strip border
with israel jabalya malaka huzzah
on the other side of the fence israeli
military has deployed soldiers including
snipers and tanks to the border
soldiers have opened fire on
palestinians approaching the funds with
tear gas rubber bullets and live
ammunition
violence during the protests has
resulted in the deadliest days of the
israeli-palestinian conflict since the
2014 war on gaza 33 weeks now have
carried within them at least 210
palestinians killed including 33
children two journalists two paramedics
and so far the number of injuries has
reached 24
516.
despite the weekly casualties in
palestinians from the great march of
return the enormous israeli airstrikes
that were carried on the entire strip on
the past sunday and monday of this week
have resulted in 15 killed and at least
90 others were injured
