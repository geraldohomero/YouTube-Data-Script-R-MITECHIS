IN THE REGION WAS ATTACKED
DESTROYING SEVERAL BUILDINGS
INCLUDING A SCHOOL AND A
HOSPITAL.
CTV'S JOY MALBON IS IN LVIV FOR
US THIS MORNING.
SHE'S GOT THE LATEST.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
LET'S START WITH THE SITUATION
IN KYIV.
RUSSIA IS SHELLING TARGETS IN
THE CITY SUBURBS.
WHAT'S THE LATEST AS WE WAIT AND
WATCH TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH
THE CAPITOL?
>> Reporter: THE RUSSIANS HAVE
BEEN SLOWLY BUT SURELY SQUEEZING
THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THAT IS THE
GRAND PRIZE.
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY HAS POSTED
ANOTHER SOCIAL MEDIA POST AND HE
WAS TELLING UKRAINIANS BE STRONG
, FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY.
HE SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THAT CITY
ALONE AND THERE ARE TENS OF
THOUSANDS STILL TRAPPED.
>> Marcia: YOU MENTIONED
TALKS, A FOURTH-ROUND BETWEEN
UKRAINE AND RUSSIA.
TELL US MORE ABOUT THE
EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS LATEST
ROUND OF TALKS?
>> Reporter: I'M HERE IN LVIV
WHERE IT'S BEEN CONSIDERED A
PRETTY SAFE CITY.
YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE BEHIND ME
GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS AND
GROCERY SHOPPING.
I DID VISIT A SCHOOL WERE A
NUMBER OF REFUGEES HAVE BEEN
TAKEN IN, AND THEY ARE QUITE
CONCERNED.
I ASKED ABOUT THE PEACE TALKS,
TO THEY HAVE ANY HOPE, AND THE
OPTIMISM.
ONE WOMAN KIND OF MADE A FACE
BECAUSE WE DON'T EXACTLY SPEAK
THE SAME LANGUAGE AND THERE

BUT AGAIN, THE FACT THAT THE
