Since late September, the oil market has
been in a supply driven, mainly funk,
headed straight down with occasional
pullbacks.
When something flares up in the Middle
East, but it's just headed down.
We didn't get those big inventory draws
late last year that everyone thought we
were going to have in the summer.
Even Indian demand a rock star on the
demand side on oil decelerated.
China not doing great.
And OPEC plus so far not effectively
signaling coherence and the ability to
put a floor in.
So that remains the main driver.
We're headed down until we see those
inventory draws or geopolitical risk
materializes.
Does that mean then the risk of a supply
shock fob is much higher than it
traditionally is?
I think so.
As I said, rapid and is telling clients
it's at least 30%, at least 30%, because
while Tehran doesn't want war, President
Biden doesn't want war.
No one is willing to de-escalate.
Everybody is escalating here over the
holidays.
I mean, Iran said a long range drone
with long range drone to hit a tanker
off of India and then the U.S.
accused it of doing so.
And as we saw, the US is shooting back
now with the Houthis.
This is not de-escalating.
So I think the market is too complacent.
I think there needs to be at least $12
of geopolitical risk.
I mean, a 30% chance of a Hormuz type An
event is a kind of a $12, I think,
premium.
And I think we have pennies in the
market right now.
So that would take us to, say $87 on
Brent.
But do you think it would be a slow
grind to that level?
No, I think we're probably going to see
events sort of jolt us higher.
And again, I would look mainly to
Lebanon and Israel and Hezbollah,
because that's coming next after and as
Gaza winds down, also any more Iranian
adventurism, I mean, if they start
launching munitions from their own
country, as they did last week and
attack the oil tankers and vessels
closer to Hormuz and so forth, and we
focus on that, it'll go higher because
number, the Red Sea is a shortcut.
It's no fun having to take two extra
weeks and going around it, but it can be
avoided.
Hormuz is a bottleneck.
That is a heart attack, and I think
that's going to come on the table as
Iran continues to escalate here.
