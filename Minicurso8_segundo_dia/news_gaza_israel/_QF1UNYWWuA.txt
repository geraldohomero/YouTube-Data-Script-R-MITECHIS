A THIRD WORLD WAR.
OUR CORRESPONDENT NOAH PRANSKY
EXPLAINS WHY THE ANSWER IS NOT A
SIMPLE YES OR NO
>> Reporter: ON THE SAME DAY
THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN MET WIT
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, CHINA'
PRESIDENT XI WAS HOSTING
VLADIMIR PUTIN
IS IT ANY SURPRISE THAT GLOBAL
SEARCHES FOR WORLD WAR THREE
HAVE EXPLODED THE LAST FEW
WEEKS?
WE OFTEN SIMPLIFY INTERNATIONA
ISSUES INTO TWO CAMPS, GOO
VERSUS BAD OR ALLIES VERSU
AXIS
BUT IT IS MORE COMPLICATED THA
JUST PICKING A SIDE.
EVERY WORD IS CONSEQUENTIAL.
LET ME EXPLAIN WHY
ONE BORDER WAR USUALLY HAS TWO
BATTLING SIDES BUT DOZENS AN
DOZENS OF POLITICAL GEOPOLITICAL
DIMENSIONS
IT IS NOT JUST ISRAEL AND HAMA
WITH A STAKE IN WHAT HAPPENED IN
GAZA BUT ALSO IRAN, SAUD
ARABIA, AND OTHER COUNTRIES WITH
COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS WITH
PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS.
JUST LIKE IT IS NOT JUST RUSSI
AND UKRAINE WITH A STAKE IN THAT
WAR.
NATO COUNTRIES HAVE SKIN IN TH
GAME TOO
ANY ESCALATION, NO MATTER HO
JUST THE CAUSE FEELS COULD LEA
TO MORE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.
>> SO THE MORALITY OF AIDING THE
SIDE THAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT
MORALLY SO CAN GENERATE A SERIES
OF OTHER STRATEGIC PROBLEMS THAT
CARRY THEIR OWN MORA
IMPLICATIONS
>> Reporter: JOSHIA SKIFF RN
WITH THE NART NATIONAL STUDIES
OF MARYLAND SAY IT IS MORE
COMPLICATED THAN PEOPLE REALIZE.
HUSH RUSSIA HAS SUPPORTED IRAN'S
REBELS AND THOSE FIGHTING WITH
SAUDI ARABIA
RUSSIA FINDS ITSELF ISOLATED
FROM THE WESTERN WORLD AND
GROWING CLOSER TO CHINA WHIC
HAS ALSO BEEN COZYING UP TO TH
FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIES IN
AFRICA AND THE INDIA
SUBCONTINENT WHERE TWO NUCLEAR
POWERS, INDIA AND PAKISTAN HAV
BEEN WARRING ON AND OFF FOR 75
YOURS.
GOT IT
THE WHEL WORLD IS A POWDER KEG
IS IT READY TO EXPLED AGAIN INTO
A THIRD WORLD WAR?
SHIFFRIN DOESN'T THINK SO.
>> WE ARE AT A REVERSION OF TH
AVERAGE.
AFTER THE PACIFYING EFFECT O
THE U.S. DOMINANCE WHEN WE WER
SO STRONG, THIS IS UNGLUING TH
CONFLICTS AND CAUSING VIOLENCE
TO SPIKE ACROSS THE WORLD.
>> Reporter: UNFORTUNATELY, WE
LIVE ON A PLANET THAT HAS ALWAYS
HAD WAR.
BUT WITH THE RIGHT COMBINATION
OF POLICIES AND TEMPERAMENTS
LOCAL CONFLICTS CAN REMAIN LOCAL
