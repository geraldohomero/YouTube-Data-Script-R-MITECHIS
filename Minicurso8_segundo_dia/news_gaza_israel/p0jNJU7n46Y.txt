to win this
war We Must Destroy the remaining Hamas
battalions in
Rafa if
not if not Hamas will regroup rearm and
reconquer Gaza and then we're back to
square one and that's an intolerable
threat that we cannot
accept we will destroy Hamas free our
hostages and ensure that Gaza doesn't
ever pose a threat to Israel
again we will finish the job in
Rafa while enabling the civilian
population
to get out of Harm's
Way we've taken measures to minimize
civilian casualties that no other Army
has taken in
[Music]
history

[Music]
the president has been very clear about
our position on Rafa and our position is
that a military operation in Rafa that
does not protect civilians that cuts off
the main arteries of humanitarian
assistance and that places enormous
pressure on the Israel Egypt border is
not something that he can support we are
talking to the Israelis about that we
are working through
it

I don't want to teach any one of you
about what is happening in Gaza 30,000
people dead 1 point8 million
display 500,000 people on the bring of
starvation
we are facing now a
population fighting for their own
Survival humanitarian assistance needs
to get into the Gaza and the European
Union is uh working as much as we can in
order to make it possible but this is a
humanitarian crisis which is not a
natural disaster it's not a flood it's
not a
earthquake is a
man-made and when we look for
alternative ways of providing support by
sea or by air we have to remind that we
have to do it because the natural way of
providing support through roads is being
closed artificially
closed and estoration is being used as a
war
arm and when we condemn this happening
in Ukraine we have to use the same words
for what's happening in
Gaza
[Music]
yeah
