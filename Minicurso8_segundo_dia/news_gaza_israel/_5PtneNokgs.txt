Hello we go right away in
duplexes with Jerusalem where we
find our special envoy in
Israel and Gaza Valérie Goria Valérie
hello hello fabien the day after the
Kick -off of the terrestrial operation
of the Israeli army you have
rendered this morning in the old town of
Jerusalem Valérie what was
The atmosphere on site we perceive uh
very clearly a feeling of
frustration of concern anger uh
It is true that in the old town
Uh everything is all key there are
Police dams of soldiers a little
everywhere and especially what put this
morning angry people are good
obviously the events in Gaza but in
plus the pressure on the
population of Jerusalem is this
afternoon I was told that on the outskirts
of Alaxa there have been clashes that have
caused several injured there were
arrests so it all does only
contribute to anger and misunderstood
apprehension of the Palestinians to
Jerusalem then precisely while the
hostilities redoubled and that
victims are increasing the camp of the
peace tries to mobilize Valérie you
attended a demonstration yesterday
are fairly minority movements
in Israel at the moment
uh and the demonstration to which we
have assisted is organized by a
movement
Israeli-Palestinian but among these
a few hundred people we saw
very few Palestinians and we are
said that what's going on in Gaza Uh
arouses too much anger for this
type of demonstration is really
followed by the two communities a
little further we saw a little against
demonstration of a group of extremists
Israelis who shouted that he
had to shave Gaza it was quite pretty
hitting this camp uh is a minority
also very minority but at the same time
time there is among the Israelis a
A feeling of concern for anxiety
which is very contested on the Palestinian side
since we do not understand that uh the
country with the 5th more powerful
army of the world in the face of such
Demonstration of strength and
Euh violence towards a population
much more helpless including
Israeli say that she is manipulated
by Hamas thank you Valéri Goria the envoy
