GIRL, DUAL AMERICAN ISRAELI
CITIZEN, WHO TURNED FOUR ON

I'M GOING TO READ SOME OF THAT
STATEMENT TO YOU, CHARLES
BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR, OF
COURSE, ALL OF WHAT WAS SAID
JUST LAST FEW MINUTES BY THE
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT.

EMBRACES THE 17 ABDUCTEES, WHO
TURNED TO ISRAEL, 14 OF OUR
CITIZENS, AND THREE FOREIGN
CITIZENS WHO RETURNED TO ISRAEL
TODAY, THEIR FAMILIES WERE
INFORMED BY THE IMPORTED
OFFICIALS, BUT THEY WERE ON
THEIR WAY TO ISRAEL.
THESE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS
COMMITTED TO RETURN ALL
ABDUCTEES AND MISSING PERSONS,
AND THEN IT SAYS, MAN THE VERY
TOP OF THAT LIST, CHARLES, IS
ABIGAIL IN THE DOM, AGED FOUR.
SHE IS THE YOUNGEST ON THIS
LIST.
THE OLDEST IS AGE 84, SO QUITE

AGAIN, BUT, AND OTHER FOLKS
COMING OUT AND OTHER HASSE JUST
