it was anticipated and now israeli
ground troops have entered gaza
a major escalation up to now missiles
had been sent into gaza city
overnight and again in the morning
targeting the hamas military
those civilian casualties too are
climbing and today a massive funeral
procession for hamas commanders
just across the border israelis could
see hamas rockets lifting off from gaza
life is anything but normal here
in loud cafe patrons scattered as bombs
fell
just missing this apartment and israelis
too mourn the dead
[Applause]
but there is a disturbing turn in towns
like lorde where jews and arabs have
coexisted peacefully
protests by israeli arabs turned violent
this week
this jewish man says a mob attacked his
car a local synagogue was burned
but in another town a car driven by an
arab was blocked
the driver pulled and beaten by jewish
rioters
it was never like this says this jewish
resident
his friend adding we need to live here
together
one analyst says the causes of the
unrest run deep
towns and cities that have once been
pretty much peaceful
bastions of coexistence are now blowing
up with
direct hand-to-hand combat what i would
say is that there's an ongoing
systemic issue of oppression of
palestinian
citizens diplomatic efforts have so far
achieved little they want to see
de-escalation they want to see both
sides
sitting down and talking through and
stopping the violence
what we do mean now is diplomacy this is
the incredibly
sad thing while politics is being played
and missiles are being thrown back and
forth there are people on the ground
children mothers fathers
on both sides being killed israel's
prime minister elbow-bumped israeli
soldiers today
he said we continue striking hamas and
added it will
take more time it's clear now
what netanyahu meant as troops gathered
on the gaza border
and late thursday night israel sent its
military into gaza
