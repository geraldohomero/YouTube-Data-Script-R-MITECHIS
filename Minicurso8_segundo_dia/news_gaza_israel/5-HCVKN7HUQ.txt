Diana Guerrero from Veracruz
who at the beginning of the conflict fled together
With his family forgetting at home the
PASSOPORTS REMEMBER WE SHARE IT TODAY
We talked to her and confirmed that
Fortunately he already has them in his possession
And they return on the next flights of
rescue I am
really convincing my husband that
He leaves with me is what I would like
I don't want to leave it here I hope
He who comes with me he fears because
He says that his whole family is here
All life is here our house is
Diana Guerrero's testimony one from
hundreds of Mexicans who remain
Barated in Israel waiting for power
Back healthy and saved to our country

For 5 years in Israel with its two
children and his wife born in that country

terror that lived when the
War what about you were inside and
how they decide to leave because it all started at
6 in the morning the sirens began
Good we listen to bombs

Every time there was an alarm one
We grabbed the children and we were going
On the floor one of my friends called me and me
