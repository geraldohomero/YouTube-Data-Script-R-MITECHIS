Yilo Hospital in Telaviv today has been able to
see his sister Karina who after
52 days of captivity has been put in
FREEDOM WE DO NOT SPEAK we hug him 5
minutes I was in my hand hugging her
Strong strong strong the testimony of your
sister has left the
family as well as the description of the
place where they had them retained is a
basement a large piece a room
Large room like this had like a floor but
Every other was mud and dirty
sister has lost 11 kg in the last
weeks because hostages barely
They receive food in the tunnels
underground where they are locked
that ate gave him one day they could
give it a bit of bread with another cheese
day they gave him a little rice but
It was all measured
Not every hunger were all day
The worst moment for her according to
His brother was when they separated her
For three weeks of his daughters now
one of the little ones will have to be
Intervened and the 11 -year -old boy
an operation has to pass
eh when they were kidnapped when they were
carrying it for Gaza received a
fragment
From something of a bullet it can be in the
leg and have to pass an operation
The Engel family lived in the Kibuc Niros
The place where they were kidnapped
The father's brother tells us how
They lived the attack of 7 of
October he had a gun and my brother
He went outside with the gun and no longer
We know nothing more after

Thanks to the truce still dozens of
people are still kidnapped within
Gaza as the Kfir brothers and Ariel de
10 months and 4 years for which today your
family has shouted to ever
the
They have never taken them and ever
We ask you to bring them back the
responsibility for your health and your
Freedom is directly in the hands
ever a concentration to ask for
that negotiations between your government
and never stop until
