i want to read something a mother named
iman in raza wrote two days ago
she said quote tonight i put the kids to
sleep in our bedroom
so that when we die we die together
and no one would live to mourn
the loss of another one
the statement broke me a little more
because of
my country's policies and funding will
deny this mother's right to see children
live
her own children live without fear and
to grow old without painful trauma
and violence we must condition
aid to israel on compliance with
international human rights
and end the apartheid we must with no
hesitation
demand that our country recognize the
unconditional support of israel has
enabled
the erasure of palestinian life in the
denial of the rights of millions of
refugees
and emboldens the apartheid policies
that human rights watch has detailed
thoroughly
in their recent report the house of
representatives previously declared it
shall be the
policy of the united states to
officially and publicly condemn hamas
for violating
the international law of armed conflict
by exploiting civilians
democracies on the other hand act to
limit civilian casualties
and do everything they can to defend
their own citizens
israel is a democracy the only jewish
state in the world
and our friend and ally and israel
has a right to defend her citizens these
terrorist organizations do
not care about people or peace they seek
only to destroy the jewish state
israel has every right to defend herself
no nation
should be subject to a barrage of rocket
fire like what we see
on this easel on a civilian population
let me be clear every single death
in this conflict is a tragedy every
rocket
and bomb that targets civilians is a war
crime
i feel the pain of every child who's
forced to hide under their beds
because they fear for their life and
every parent who deals with that anguish
and i wish we as a nation treated
that pain equally but right now we are
not
and instead of condemning platon crimes
against humanity and human rights abuses
many members of congress have instead
fallen back on a blanketed statement
defending israel's airstrikes against
civilians
under the guise of self-defense
