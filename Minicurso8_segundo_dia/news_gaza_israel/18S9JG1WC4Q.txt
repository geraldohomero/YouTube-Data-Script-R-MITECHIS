TIMES AS WELL SAYING THE
ISRAELIS HAVE ALREADY
POSITIONED TROOPS, MATERIALS,
WEAPONS AWAY FROM THE BORDERS
WITH THE GAZA STRIP AND TOWARD
LEBANON. TO HIM AND HIS
FOLLOWERS, THAT WAS ALREADY
SOME LEVEL OF MISSION
ACCOMPLISHED.
>> MATT BRADLEY, LIFE FOR US IN
LEBANON.
THANK YOU.
>>> HOW ARE PEOPLE INSIDE THE
PENTAGON RESPONDING AND DO
OFFICIALS EXPECT  HEZBOLLAH TO
BECOME MORE ACTIVE AND WERE
BASED ON WHAT WE HEARD TODAY?
>> Reporter:  HEZBOLLAH IS ONE
OF THE BIG CONCERNS HERE BUT
THERE WAS SOME RELIEF ABOUT THE
FACT THAT  IT STOP SHORT OF
ANNOUNCING THAT IT WOULD
IMMEDIATELY GET'S BULLY OR ENTER
THIS WAR.
CRISMATT WAS JUST SAYING
OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE AND
THEY WERE PREPARED TO GET MORE
INVOLVED IN THE WAR BUT THEY
STOP SHORT OF SAYING THEY WOULD
RIGHT NOW.
THAT ACTUALLY ACCORDING TO THE
OFFICIALS I SPOKE WITH THIS
MORNING, THAT BROUGHT THEM SOME
RELIEF THAT HE DIDN'T GO AS FAR
AS THEY FEARED HE MIGHT.
THE U.S. MILITARY, FOR THEIR

PART HAS SENT JUST THOUSANDS OF

>>  YOU HAVE NEW REPORTING
ABOUT THE U.S. FLYING DRONES
OVER GAZA TO HELP WITH HOSTAGE
RECOVERY.
WHAT KIND OF Ã‘ THESE DRONES
PROVIDE?
>>  THEY HAVE BEEN FLYING SINCE
SOON AFTER THE ATTACK ON
OCTOBER 7th.
I HAVE TO SAY WE HAVE BEEN
ASKING U.S. MILITARY OFFICIALS,
WE CANNOT FIND ANY TASTE OF
U.S. MILITARY DRONES FLYING OVER
GAZA IN ANY TYPE OF WAY.
THIS SEEMS TO BE AN
UNPRECEDENTED MOVE.
THEY ARE UNARMED AND LOOKING
FOR ANY KINDS OF PATTERN OF
LIFE THAT THEY CAN SHARE BACK
WITH THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES
WHO ARE IN THE LEAD ON ANY
POSSIBLE HOSTAGE RESCUE
OPERATION.
REMEMBER WE HAVE BEEN HEARING
FOR WEEKS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD
AS MANY IF NOT MOST OF THESE
HOSTAGES ARE BEING HELD IN
TUNNELS. IT IS NOT CLEAR
WHETHER THE DRONES WOULD BE
ABLE TO DO MUCH IF IN FACT
HOSTAGES ARE IN THESE TUNNELS.
AGAIN, JUST PROVIDING ANYTHING
THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME
INTELLIGENCE BACK TO THE IDF
THAT'LL HELP WITH THIS CASE.
THAT IS WHY THE DRONES ARE UP
