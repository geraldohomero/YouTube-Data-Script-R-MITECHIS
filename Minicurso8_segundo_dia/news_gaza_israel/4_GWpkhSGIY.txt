yet even through Ramadan even though
Ramadan has begun The Killing bombing
and bloodshed continue in
Gaza we recently entered the six months
since the amas terror attacks in Israel
and the catastrophic Israel Onslaught in
Gaza
began my strongest appeal today is to
honor the spirit of Ramadan by silencing
the guns
and removing all obstacles to ensure the
delivery of life-saving Aid at the speed
and massive scale
required at the same time and in the
Ramadan Spirit of compassion I call for
the immediate release of all
hostages the highs of the world are
watching the highs of History are
watching we cannot look away we must act
to avoid more preventive able
death we have witnessed months after
months of Civilian killing and
destruction at a level that is
unprecedented in all my years as
Secretary
General meanwhile life-saving relief for
Palestinians in Gaza is coming in
trickles if it comes at
all International humanitarian law lies
in tets and the threatened Israeli
assault on Rafa could plummet the people
of Gaza into an even deeper circle of
hell for months leaders have appealed
for an immediate humanitarian
ceasefire and the immediate release of
all
hostages but the most compelling calls
have come from the families of the
victims of this
war I've never forget my meetings with
them and they have St at this very
Podium and addressed you United in
remarkable courage and
unfathomable
pain Israeli ostage families who shared
their torment and anguish and pleaded
for the immediate release of their loved
ones and Palestinian families who shared
heartwrenching testimonies of family
members killed in Israeli bombardments
and pleaded for an immediate ceasefire
