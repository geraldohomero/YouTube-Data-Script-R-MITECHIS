>> -- FROM PARTS OF UKRAINE, THE
WORLD IS SEEING THE DEATH AND
DESTRUCTION LEFT IN ITS WAKE,
AND WE'RE SEEING IN PARTICULAR
THE HORROR THAT HAS BEEN LEFT
BEHIND IN BUCHA, SOMETHING THAT
IS TOUCHING PEOPLE LITERALLY
AROUND THE WORLD.
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN BUCHA IS
NOT A RANDOM ACT OF A ROGUE
UNIT.
IT'S A DELIBERATE CAMPAIGN TO
KILL, TO TORTURE, TO RAPE, TO
COMMIT ATROCITIES.
THE REPORTS ARE MORE THAN
CREDIBLE.
THE EVIDENCE IS THERE FOR THE
WORLD TO SEE.
THIS REINFORCES OUR
DETERMINATION AND THE
DETERMINATION OF COUNTRIES
AROUND THE WORLD TO MAKE SURE
THAT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, ONE DAY
OR ANOTHER, THERE IS
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE
COMMITTED THESE ACTS, FOR THOSE
WHO ORDERED THEM.
THERE IS ALSO A STRONG DOARMINGS
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CONTINUE TO
SUPPORT UKRAINE IN ITS GREAT
FIGHT TO PUSH THE RUSSIAN
AGGRESSION OUT OF UKRAINE AND OF
COURSE, TO SUSTAIN AND INCREASE
THE PRESSURE ON RUSSIA TO STOP
THIS AGGRESSION.
WE'RE HEADING OFF TO BRUSSELS
NOW FOR A MEETING OF THE NATO
FOREIGN MINISTERS, FOR A MEETING
OF THE G-7 FOREIGN MINISTERS,
THE LEADING DEMOCRATIC ECONOMIES
IN THE WORLD, ALL OF WHICH WILL
GO TO SUPPORTING THE EFFORTS OF
ACCOUNTABILITY AND SUPPORT FOR
UKRAINE, INCREASED PRESSURE ON
RUSSIA.
>> Reporter: YOU TALK ABOUT
THE DELIBERATE CAMPAIGN TO KILL
CIVILIANS.
-- EVIDENCE LINKING SENIOR
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS IN MOSCOW TO
EITHER ORDERING OR KNOWLEDGE OF
THE ACTS BEING COMMITTED?
>> WE'RE WORKING AS ARE OTHERS
TO PUT THE EVIDENCE TOGETHER TO
SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE
UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR GENERAL, TO
SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE U.N.
HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL'S
COMMISSION OF INQUIRY THAT WE
HELPED ESTABLISH, MARTIALS ALL
OF THIS, PUTTING ALL THIS
TOGETHER, WE SAID BEFORE THE
AGGRESSION THAT WE ANTICIPATED
THAT IF IT WENT FORWARD, THERE
WOULD BE ATROCITIES COMMITTED,
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN
GOING INTO THE AGGRESSION
SUGGESTED THIS WOULD BE PART OF
THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN.
HORRIFICALLY, TRAG
