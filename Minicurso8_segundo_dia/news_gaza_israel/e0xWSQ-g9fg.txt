After 7 weeks of Israel war ever
They have reached an agreement for the first
high to the fire what they consist of
signed a cessation of bombings and attacks
For 4 days in exchange for liberation
of hostages and prisoners will never release
50 reins of gaza through the crossing of
Rafa on the border of Egypt and Israel
release 150 Palestinian prisoners
The high on fire can be extended to
10 days if the two parties meet
With the agreement the idea is that the truce
It extends one day for every 10 reenes
Liberated by ever for its part of Israel
You can also free 150 prisoners
more in total about 300 people in their
Most teenage men the agreement
Also allows entry into the strip
of gaza of trucks with food help
Medical and fuel and what does a
High to Israel fire undertakes not
fly over drones and airplanes in the south of
The strip during the four days of
truce and in the north only for 6
hours a day on the other hand is expected
to never stop shooting rockets
to Israeli soil and why they have signed
a truce now basically for
pressures the families of
kidnapped are desperate to see
Like the terrestrial invasion in Gaza no
is serving to bring your beings
dear home and have pressed
government to find a
Solution In addition you have to take into account
the international pressures that are
receiving Israel for disastrous
Humanitarian situation more than 14,000
people have died there is more than one
million displaced and the area lacks
of food combustible and
medicines and never get out of all this
Well this pause will help you elaborate
New strategies change positions
and regroup since he has lost the
control of many areas of northern
Gaza and what will happen after these days
Israel is expected to resume the offensive
and continue where he left him in
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has made it clear that war
continue
