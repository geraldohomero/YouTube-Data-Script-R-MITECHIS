since the beginning of this war
thousands of families have come here to
ship a hospital considering it to be the
largest hospital in Gaza City to take
refuge it's not just the patients inside
the hospital itself but it's thousands
of families who are taking refuge in the
premises and the yard of this
hospital so we're now heading from the
back yard of the hospital to the front
yard of the hospital and as you can see
the hospital is packed with people
these are many of the fames who have
lost their homes who have had their
homes bombarded and who were asked to
evacuate their homes some of them even
have families or have um uh uh siblings
and other family members in the hospital
itself that are injured and have nowhere
else to go I have Dr aish abua here with
me he's a surgeon in a shifa hospital
doctor we've
seen different amounts of uh casualties
in the hospital I can see that the
hospital is completely packed the beds
are everywhere in the receptions of the
hospital what is going on please tell me
unfortunately the number of cases is
difficult for us to manage all of them
in one time so we have a a
challenge in treating this these cases
we have shortage in electricity and also
in the bits of for the bent and in the
department the department of hospital is
full of patient yesterday there was no
water in the Sha

the proper help and the proper they're
not getting the proper Heth or the
proper medical treatment that they need
