>>> A SMALL GROUP OF MOTHERS
DETAINED IN NORTHEASTERN SYRIA
CLAIM OTTAWA'S FORCING THEM TO
MAKE AN AGONIZING CHOICE, THEIR
CHILDREN ARE CANADIAN AND ARE
ELIGIBLE FOR REPATRIATION, BUT
THE WOMEN ARE NOT.
SO TO GET THE KIDS TO SAFETY IN
CANADA, THE MOTHERS FEAR THEY
MAY HAVE TO GIVE THEM UP.
CTV'S JUDY TRINH HAS MORE.
>> Reporter: AFTER YEARS,
FREEDOM IS WITHIN GRASP FOR SOME
CANADIAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN, BUT
NOT ALL.
UNDER THE FEDERAL AGREEMENT,
WOMEN WHO MARRIED CANADIAN MEN
DO NOT QUALIFY FOR REPATRIATION,
BUT THEIR CHILDREN DO IF THEIR
MOTHERS LET THEM GO.
ONE WOMAN SAYS GLOBAL AFFAIRS IS
DEMANDING SHE MAKE A DECISION BY
NEXT WEEK.
>> THESE CHILDREN WILL GET
DESTROYED.
THEY'LL LIVE THE REST OF THEIR
LIFE KNOWING THEIR MOTHER
ABANDONED THEM.
>> Reporter: ASIA, WHO WE'RE
NOT IDENTIFYING TO KEEP HER
SAFE, IS MARRIED TO A MAN FROM
OTTAWA.
WHY DID YOU FOLLOW HIM TO SYRIA?
>> I KNEW HIS ATTACK.
HE GOT VERY SICK.
>> Reporter: HE WAS
RESEARCHING THE ISLAMIC STATE.
SEVEN YEARS AGO, SHE FOLLOWED
HIM TO SYRIA BEFORE KURDISH
FORCES TOOK OVER THE TERRITORY
AND THREW HIM IN PRISON.
THEY HAVE THREE CHILDREN.
THE OLDEST IS SEVERELY AUTISTIC.
HER MIDDLE SON IS SUFFERING FROM
BURNS AFTER FALLING INTO A
KEROSENE HEATER.
HER DAUGHTER WAS BORN IN THE
CAMP.
>> I HAVE NO CHOICE.
EITHER I LOSE THEM, NOT SEEING
THEM, OR I LOSE THEM HERE AS --
YOUNG BODIES.
>> Reporter: THERE ARE FOUR
MOTHERS AND 10 CHILDREN IN THE
SAME SITUATION, THEIR CANADIAN
FATHERS MISSING, MAYBE EVEN
DEAD, AND THE CHILDREN MAY NOT
HAVE OTHER RELATIVES IN CANADA.
>> IT'S ONE OF THE CRUELIST AND
MOST INHUMANE POLICY, FAMILY
SEPARATION.
FORCED FAMILY SEPARATION.
YOU DESCRIBED IT AS A CHOICE.
IT'S A NON-CHOICE.
WHERE THE CHOICE SITS, IN FACT,
IS WITH THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT.
>> Reporter: GLOBAL AFFAIRS
DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR
COMMENT.
MEANWHILE, LAWYERS ARE TRYING TO
GET THE MOTHERS TEMPORARY
RESIDENT PERMITS TO GET THEM TO
CANADA.
