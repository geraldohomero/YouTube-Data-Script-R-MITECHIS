WHO HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEIR
RELATIVES ARE DECEASED AND NOW
FINDING THEM ALIVE AND THEY
MIGHT FIND OUT THE TRAGIC NEWS.
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, BIG
PICTURE ABOUT HOW ISRAEL IS
CONDUCTING THIS WAR.
AS YOU KNOW, THE IDF HAS TAKEN
THE HEAD OF AL SHIFA HOSPITAL IN
FOR QUESTIONING.
ISRAEL, THE UNITED STATES HAVE
SAID THAT THEIR INTELLIGENCE
POINTS TO THE FACT THAT HAMAS IS
EFFECTIVELY EMBEDDING ITSELF
INSIDE AL SHIFA AND INSIDE OTHER
HOSPITALS.
DO YOU THINK THE UNITED STATES
SHOULD RELEASE ITS INTELLIGENCE
PUBLICLY OR AT LEAST MORE
INFORMATION PUBLICLY TO HELP
MAKE THE CASE TO PEOPLE GLOBALLY
WHO ARE SAYING TOO MANY CIVILIAN
LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST HERE.
>> WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT
RIGHT NOW THIS IS A WAR ZONE,
AND ISRAEL HAS OPENLY STATED
THAT ITS GOAL IS TO TAKE OUT
HAMAS AND HAMAS' CONTROL GAZA.
HAMAS STILL HAS CONTROL OF GAZA.
WHEN THIS CEASEFIRE ENDS
NETANYAHU HAS SAID THE CONFLICT
WILL CONTINUE AND THE CONFLICT
WILL CONTINUE AS ISRAEL HAS
STATED UNTIL HAMAS IS REMOVED
AND OBVIOUSLY, ONE OF THE ISSUES
THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IN
RELEASING INTELIENCE IS THAT
SINCE THIS IS A WAR ZONE AND
YOU'RE TRYING TO ENTER THE
DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YOU
STILL HAVE IMPACTS THAT CAN
IMPACT THE OUTCOME, YOU HAVE TO
BE CAUTIOUS.
>> ONE A.P. REPORT DESCRIBED
WHAT HAPPENED IN GAZA AS AN
UNINHABITABLE MOONSCAPE.
SHOULD THERE BE MORE
TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE
INTELLIGENCE THAT ISRAEL HAS AND
ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THE
UNITED STATES HAS ABOUT HAMAS?
>> I THINK IT IS BENEFICIAL TO
TELL THE STORY OF WHAT HAMAS IS.
>> WOULD YOU SUPPORT MORE
TRANSPARENCY?
SHOULD MORE INTELLIGENCE BE
RELEASED?
>> THE PALESTINIANS ARE AS MUCH
PRISONERS TO HAMAS IF GAZA.
