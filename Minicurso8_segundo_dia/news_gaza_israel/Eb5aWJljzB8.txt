>> Reporter: THE PRIME
MINISTER STARTED HIS DAY HERE AT
St. MICHAEL'S CATHEDRAL IN THE
CENTRE OF KYEV.
HE LAID A WREATH AT THE WALL OF
REMEMBRANCE, WHICH IS COVERED
WITH PHOTOGRAPHS OF UKRAINIAN
SOLDIERS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE
WAR WITH RUSSIA.
HE THEN WALKED AROUND HERE
THROUGH WHAT REALLY ARE A BUNCH
OF MUSEUM PIECES NOW.
DESTROYED TANKS AND EQUIPMENT,
RUSSIAN EQUIPMENT THAT
UKRAINIANS HAD ON DISPLAY IN THE
SQUARE FOR SOME TIME.
THE PRIME MINISTER SPENT A FEW
MINUTES, IT WAS REALLY A
WALKABOUT, TALKING TO UKRAINIAN
SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED
BY CANADA.
HE THEN HAD A BILATERAL MEETING
WITH PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR
ZELENSKYY OF UKRAINE.
THE TWO LEADERS SIGNED A JOINT
DECLARATION CONDEMNING RUSSIA'S
INVASION OF UKRAINE AND CALLING
ON RUSSIA TO UNILATERALLY,
UNCONDITIONALLY, WITHDRAW ITS
FORCES FROM THIS COUNTRY.
CANADA ANNOUNCED ANOTHER
$500 MILLION IN MILITARY AID TO
UKRAINE, MONEY THAT WILL GO TO
TRAIN UKRAINIAN PILOTS ON F-16
FIGHTER JETS, VERY IMPORTANT.
CANADA WILL SUPPLY ANOTHER 300
MISSILES FOR USE IN AIR DEFENCE
HERE AND PROVIDE ANOTHER 10,000
ROUNDS OF ARTILLERY SHELLS TO
UKRAINE.
TRUDEAU RECOMMITTED CANADA'S
SUPPORT FOR THIS COUNTRY.
CANADA, HE SAID, WILL BE THERE
WITH WHATEVER IT TAKES FOR AS
LONG AS IT TAKES.
HE REFUSED, HOWEVER, TO DIRECTLY
BLAME RUSSIA FOR DESTROYING THAT
DAM THIS WEEK, EARLIER THIS
WEEK, THAT CAUSED SUCH
EXTRAORDINARY FLOODING IN THE
SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.
TRUDEAU VERY CAREFULLY SAID THAT
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAM, HE
SAID, WAS IN FACT A DIRECT
CONSEQUENCE OF RUSSIA'S INVASION
OF UKRAIN
