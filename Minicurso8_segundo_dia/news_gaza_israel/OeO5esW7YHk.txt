24 to the 6th day of truce in Gaza this
Wednesday the prospect of news
Liberation of hostage and prisoners
Palestinians Qatar works with
force to a lasting extension of this
break in fighting according to a source
Close to Hamas the Islamist movement y
is willing Karim Yayaoui our ENV
special at
Jerusalem is a new one
new aspect a new one new
parameter to take into account the
Islamic jihad said yesterday that a
part of the hostages that had been released
was uh in his possession we also saw
Images of the interior of the band of
Gaza where men of Islamic jihad
moved with fighters from
Hamas uh is not necessarily a
additional complexity element in
negotiation term but inside
From the Gaza Strip the situation seems
somewhat chaotic in any case the
continuous efforts with force on the side of
Qatar since there was a meeting with
The boss of the CIA The boss of Mossade
and the head of the intelligence services
Egyptians to try to think about the
implementation of this truce for
that she can continue we evoke the
possibility uh and it is undoubtedly with
indirect links with Hamas or
in any case indirect contacts with
Hamas the possibility that we can
release men or or
military staff so we are good
far for the moment because we know
all that when it takes
negotiating this kind of profile is going to be
complicate and then another element that
complicate things is that we have
heard Itamar Bengirvir the head of thread
of a far -right party that makes
part of the coalition and which is also
Minister of Internal Security
explained that if the truce continued
beyond 10 days he would drop the
Neanahou government to which to which
is part of the coalition to which
is part of sound and therefore that
it adds an element of complexity
policy pressure or true will
to have a coping obviously it's a
question that the Israelis arise
