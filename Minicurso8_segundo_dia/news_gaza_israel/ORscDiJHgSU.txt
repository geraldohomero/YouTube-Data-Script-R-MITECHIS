The Talmud says what comes from the heart grows 
with the heart. That's the warmth and kinship I  
feel with the Jewish community. I got in trouble, 
I got criticized very badly in the Southern part  
of my state and in the Southern part of the 
country when 35 years ago I said you don't have  
to be a Jew to be a Zionist, I am a Zionist. You 
don't have to be a jew to be a Zionist; Hanukkah  
is the story of miracles. Think about that.
Folks, were there no Israel, there wouldn't  
be a Jew in the world that was safe. I make no 
bones about it, I have had my differences with  
some Israeli leadership. I have known Bibi now 
for 51 years. He has a picture on his desk of  
he and I when he was a young member of the 
Israeli service here, the foreign service,  
and I was a 32-year old senator. And I wrote on 
the top of it, Bibi, I love you, but I don't agree  
with a damn thing you have to say. It's about 
the same thing today; I love him...But look.
 
We will continue to lead the world in humanitarian 
assistance to innocent Palestinian civilians to  
emphasize to our Israeli friends the need 
to protect human life. And let me be clear,  
Hamas using rape, sexual violence, and 
terrorism, and torture of Israeli women and  
girls is appalling and unforgivable. When I was 
there, I saw some of the photographs. And it is  
beyond ... it is beyond comprehension. We all have 
to condemn such brutality without equivocation,  
without exception. I also recognize you are 
hurt from the silence and the fear for your  
safety. Because the surge of anti-semitism in 
the United States of America and around the  
world is sickening. You know, we see it across 
our communities and in our schools and colleges  
and social media. They serve as painful scars.
Let me be clear, there is no place for hate in  
America against Jews, Muslims or anybody else."
Happy Hanukkah, God bless you all.
