we appreciate too much the Brazilian
government here because they welcome us
here but we are asking the
organizations
uncr akor we are asking a Brazilian
government to help us to gather our
family they think they like come out
with surrender or people will leave the
country they will not because if they
killed the fathers and the grand fathers
these people they have sons so these
Sons will be to resist their
