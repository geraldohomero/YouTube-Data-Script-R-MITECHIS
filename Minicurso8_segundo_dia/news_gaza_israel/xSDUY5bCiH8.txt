so today is a historic day in israel
people woke up to a new prime minister
naftali bennett and yair lapid
together managed to unseat prime
minister
benjamin netanyahu had who had been 12
years in power israel's longest serving
prime minister
in history many people were celebrating
particularly in the city of tel aviv
but many people were not celebrating
more people
have actually voted for benjamin
netanyahu
than for any other party i'm here in the
town of ranana
which is the town where the new prime
minister naftali bennett lives
and i'm going to be speaking to the
people here to find out if they're happy
about the new prime minister how do you
feel about the new government today
very good very good i feel very good
a new day a very helpful day
and we waited for this a lot of time
well i think that bibi has done an awful
lot of good over his years as prime
minister of israel
especially to corona and in terms of
security but i think it is time for a
change and we're excited to see what
bennett can do
the new horizon
the new hopes and we believe
very very very good life for all of us
it's not so nice how
[Music]
i'm enormously optimistic i think any
change is good and after such a long
period with the same government i'm
hoping that the new government restores
a sense of equality social justice
optimism
starts supporting our judicial system
creates the reforms that are required in
the country and i think it's going to be
great
do you think the new government will
last no
we lost it will last
a half a year a year maybe one
years yes and after that
maybe it's good i could vote
for uh for bennett but it totally
changed his mind
and i really do not think this this
government
is not based about the ideology the
this government is based on how much
could i renounce and they renounce it a
lot and
each party renounces a lot of love so
there is absolutely no reason
for them to go back about this
announcement and that the reason i think
this government can
go straight on for a few years it
remains to be seen how long this new
government lasts
but what is certain is that today is a
historic day
for the people of israel this is jody
