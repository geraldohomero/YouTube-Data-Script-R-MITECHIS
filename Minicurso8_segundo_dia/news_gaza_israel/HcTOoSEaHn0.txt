We will quickly review one of the
most important information from the
Today's day that takes us to
Context of full conflict to the strip
of gauze because in the last hours the
Port of Gaza the most important place
For local fishing it was completely
destroyed by rounds of attacks
Israelis this in the middle of the escalation
of the conflict after almost two months
of conflict houses houses and others
Civil facilities of this port
that they see it on the screen suffered
serious damage can be seen debris by
all parts and well most of the
fishing boats sank or good
They had to be evacuated and
This were directly abandoned
Port
It is located near the Rimal district of
The city of Gaza and is the most important
As we said of the entire Gaza Strip
where fishermen are gaining life
local ones that is a source of employment
very important and since 2007 this
Port was under a naval blockade
tax by Israel as part of the
Gaza Strip lock and
Activities in the port
They restricted a small fishing
Scale was not a large port
activity but very important for
The locals within a range
strictly limited by this blockade
What did we say but this whole port
It was once the most active place for
Fisheries and activities
commercial before it was
Slowly attacked by airplanes and ships
Israeli war after
The new round of conflict broke out
Between huh the Palestinians and Israel
last October 7 now as
consequence too
They attacked this port the most important
of the Gaza Strip and of course
jobs that are lost not
people who run out of this
place to work and without inputs
necessary because we said some
CERON BOATS LOOK THAT WHO appears fair
there and others good had to be
[Music]
abandoned
