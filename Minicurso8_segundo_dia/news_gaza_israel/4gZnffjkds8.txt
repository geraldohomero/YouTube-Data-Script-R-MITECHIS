in Janine even the youngest residents
marched through the streets protesting
the killing of Palestinians in
Gaza this city in the north of the
occupied West Bank has long been a flash
point and now Israel's Army is again
stepping up anti-terror raids here even
carrying out air and drone
strikes since the 7th of October they've
been hitting us so hard and everyone is
just watching us other Arab countries
westerners
everyone is watching the destruction of
the Palestinian cause we are
Palestinians we're fighting for our land
and our honor we will not
leave this is the Janine refugee camp
one of the largest in the West Bank at
the moment it's subject to almost daily
Israeli Army raids and the entrance to
the camp was destroyed in one of those
raids just a few days
ago generations of Palestinians have
grown up in densely populated refugee
camps camps since
1948 this one is the stronghold of the
militant Janine brigades on offshoot of
Palestinian Islamic Jihad one of its
Founders was shot dead in an Israeli
anti-terror swoop this Monday his father
among the group's supporters gathered in
mourning I'm proud of him he was
defending his rights in his
homeland anyone who defends their rights
now has become a
terrorist that's their label for it
according to
them in Janine even the local head of
the party of the Palestinian Authority
no longer believes there can be a
peaceful
solution killings every day what do you
expect them to do what do you want me to
tell them to resist by throwing stones
there's no solution they're bombing us
with air strikes and missiles before we
used to trust in the peace process we
had a little bit of Hope but now we have
no hope Israel's declared war on us
a few hours later Israeli forces again
arrested this fatter leader who they
accuse of supporting Terror and carried
out further raids on Janine as
perspectives for peace in the West Bank
seem ever more
distant
