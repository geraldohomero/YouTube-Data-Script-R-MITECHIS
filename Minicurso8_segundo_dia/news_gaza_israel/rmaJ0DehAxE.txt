masters on the eve or on the eve of
a possible exchange that would generate the
Ren√©s' release of this
Information has been updated
Carolina Moroso Carolina This is Nelson
Domi at night good yesterday
something happened that was expected ok or the
Approval in principle of an agreement
for the release of 50 hostages that today
They are under the captivity of ever
Let me clarify that it is very good
express some of these issues in
potential because some of the details
They are not yet confirmed if
One looks
Officers such as the Embassy
of the United States in Jordan speak
of a success in efforts and
They also award this to work
set with Egypt and Qatar attention
With this actor but some details do not
They give them in principle we would be talking
of 50 reins among them some
North American citizens
We are talking about an exchange that
It would mean by Israel the
granting of a pause so far we can
affirm it now if this is going to be a
Pause in both air operations
as terrestrial of Israel in Gaza of 4
days is what remains to be determined
because what has transcended is that
It is a 4 -day pause and that
This could also imply the
release of 150 Palestinians who are
today and detained in Israel attention with
This is because the condition by
Israel is that they are not people who have
been arrested for murder no and this
It is very important people who have
participated in some actions before
Israel or aggression actions but that
This does not constitute a crime against a
Israeli citizen is important to mark
This at this time we still don't know
Some of the details I repeat in the
communicated for example of the
Secretary of State is
Release of 50 renes from a pause without
need the number of days the only
that do claim at this time the
North American authorities is that between
The 50 released would have citizens
North Americans thanks Carolina we will
change the subject Nelson we're going to talk about
Colplay and a complicated moment yes yes
Exact Nelson Dlay
