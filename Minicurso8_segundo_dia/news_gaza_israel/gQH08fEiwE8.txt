my lords we have a policy we have a
policy of a two-state solution
but we do not recognize palestine as a
state
ministers refuse to even use its name we
have a policy of a peace process
but we have no appetite to initiate or
prioritize one
we have a policy that settlement
building is illegal and contrary to
international law
yet there is no consequence where every
year more and more settlers
supported by the israeli government and
diaspora groups occupy more land in
palestine
we do nothing to deter israel from
expanding settlements
forced evictions and home demolitions
this
is ethnic cleansing and is denying the
reality
of the state of palestine to even exist
our policy is that east jerusalem is an
integral part of a future palestinian
state
and yet we do nothing as extremists
barging to homes terrorizing palestinian
families
who've lived there for generations our
policy is to defend human rights but no
action follows as hundreds
of palestinian children every year are
arrested mistreated and incarcerated
our policy is supporting international
accountability
and funding the international criminal
court but we oppose the icc's
investigation into war crimes in
palestine
each time my laws we fail to implement
our own policy
we send out the message to an ever
extremist right-wing israeli government
that there will be no cost or
consequences for its treatment of the
palestinians
this total impunity is feeding israel's
prolific rise
in far-right extremism leaving a society
fighting for its very soul so i want to
put on record what we know now
so that there can be no doubt in future
generations that we knew
we know about the dispossessions in
sheikh gerard about the chance of death
to arabs in jerusalem
about the attacks on worshippers in
al-aqsa about the attacks outside the
church of the holy sepulchre
we know in the west bank palestinians
and israeli settlers live side by side
the former legally but under military
law without the most basic of utilities
the latter 630 000 strong and growing
illegally present yet governed by
civilian law and living in relative
luxury two peoples in the same land
but with differing legal systems and
even
separate roads to the same place
