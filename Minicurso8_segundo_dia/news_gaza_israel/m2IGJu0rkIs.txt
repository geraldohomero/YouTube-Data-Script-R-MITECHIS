the moment of silence in the UN General
Assembly marking the International Day
of remembrance of the
Holocaust un Secretary General Antonio
gueras paid tribute to the Holocaust
victims and
survivors we come together in solidarity
and sorrow to pay tribute to 6 million
Jewish children women and men murdered
in the Holocaust and we grieve the Roma
and cinti and we mourn the millions of
others tortured starved and killed by
the Nazis and their coll
ators and today in particular in keeping
with his ear team we recognize the
courage of victims and
survivors some of the survivors
recounted harrowing Tales of witnessing
the
genocide the Yello vit Forest next to us
became the execution ground for the
remainder of water of
Jews we heard the shots somebody said I
can smell the Corpses so I started to
cry Jews were shut on sight on the
streets and systematically executed in
the jail and the outskirts of
town 3,000 Jews were killed in that
first
Aion the factory which still stands
today saved us and others many
times however the solemnity of the event
was not free from the present invective
of Israel's un Ambassador who used the
occasion to slam the UN ladies and
gentlemen to this day to this day no un
institution has condemned the October
7th
Massacre it's
shocking even the international court of
justice justice For Heaven's Sake did
not see it morally fitting to condemn
hamas's barbaric Massacre against our
children and
people the UN has had a historically
uneasy relationship with Israel the
Holocaust Remembrance Day was supposed
to remind people to never allow the
state sponsored persecution and mass
murder of people to happen again but for
the civilians in Gaza history is
repeating itself Frank youo tr2 world
