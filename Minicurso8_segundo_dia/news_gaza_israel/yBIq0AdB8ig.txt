Yes, after me, aftermaster Schai is former
Politician and
Military expert MR
Shai Lord you can explain which
Meaning the release of the two
The others can currently have hostage
Now actually kidnapped hope
To draw yes you should hope anyway
you will certainly be at some point
Released the question is only when and
Like the hostages, Hamas
thus frees their political and
military purposes can be met
That's why we all expect that everyone
others released as soon as possible
Will what do you think why
Hamas the hostages at this point
released what could the intention
Behind it I guess the hamas
which clearly proved two weeks ago
Has that you have a very cruel
Terror organization is now somehow
tries the Israeli ground offensive
To stop the Hamas knows the
Soil offensive will come very soon and
You know that you don't survive that
will that are the main goal of this
Israeli operation the complete
Destruction of the hamass structure in
Gaza because two American released
the Hamas hoped that the
US government now influence Israel
takes and maybe the soil offensive
even stops but that's nonsense
will not happen we will
Hamas
destroy one last question which
The hostages have meaning
Basically for the
Hamas n the best weapon at the moment
they have in their hands now
Can you try a prisoner
To offer exchange and which
Request you always for
Possible negotiation talks considered
have I can say there is there
No negotiation there is nothing about what about
we could speak you must immediately
All hostage and the earlier
You do that the better it is for
the
Hamas Mr Thanks you so much interview and
So I give back from Telaviv
Cologne
