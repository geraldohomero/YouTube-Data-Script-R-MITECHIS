In the last two weeks, this country has
gone through something that no country,
no people should have to endure, least
of all Israel, which has lived through
some of the most awful scenes, the
specter of violence and terrorism every
day of its existence.
And I want to share the deep condolences
of the British people and stressed that
we absolutely support Israel's right to
defend itself in line with international
law, to go after Hamas, to take back
hostages, deter further incursions, and
to strengthen your security for the long
term.
Now, I know that you are taking every
precaution to avoid harming civilians in
direct contrast to the terrorists of
Hamas, which seek to put civilians in
harm's way.
But I also want to thank you for the
support that your government has given
to the families of British nationals
caught up in this horror, including your
efforts to release the hostages, secure
their release.
And I know that we will continue to
cooperate, particularly with regard to
the British nationals that are involved.
Can I also say that we have seen the
scenes over the past day that have
shocked all of us, particularly at the
hospital, and we mourn the loss of every
innocent life, civilians of every faith,
every nationality who have been killed.
And we also recognize that the
Palestinian people are victims of Hamas,
too.
And that is why I welcome your decision
yesterday that you took to ensure that
routes into Gaza will be opened for
humanitarian aid to enter.
I'm glad that you made that decision.
We will support it.
We're increasing our aid to the region
and we will look to get more support to
people as quickly as we can.
The last thing for me to close on is
this.
You describe this as Israel's darkest
hour.
Well, then it's for me to say I'm proud
to stand here with you in Israel's
darkest hour as your friend.
We will stand with you in solidarity.
We will stand with your people.
And we also want you to win.
