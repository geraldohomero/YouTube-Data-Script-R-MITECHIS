Many in the world have asked us not to enter the Strip
Gaza
We entered, they pressed that we would not enter Gaza City
If they warned us not to enter the language of the faint-hearted who was being used
As a central terrorist base's. The hammer went in
We have to agree to a full cease-fire. We fought and I moved
We'll only agree to a temporary cease-fire and only in exchange
You brought back my abductees The army and Beck recommended to the cabinet together
The US request to allow entry
Limited to two tankers a day two fuel tankers
By day The War Cabinet agreed here
One is a minimum amount of fuel
Fuel for running water and sewage pumps without which you have activated
We're expecting an immediate outbreak of plague. No.
He agreed that no one who supported the description should enter
Paying for the sea and the families of terror and educator His children
The murder of Jews and the destruction of the State of Israel without upheaval
The Civil Administration, which will be in Gaza, is just a question
Time's up That Gaza will return to terror and that is not what I am
I am ready to agree and there is another condition that I am setting for the day
After the ceremony, there will be complete freedom of action In the strip
Gaza against all
A threat only to the question of those outside the crown
More like the ones outside the Strip for all of us
Hamas people are my son
Death every day decreases the places where it passes
The Hamas terrorists can turn around who was on the side
West's. The city realizes that the tab he's already met
The power of the enemy who is on the side
The East understands this tonight and will understand That's in the days
The closest and also whoever is in the south of the strip
Gaza will understand this soon
