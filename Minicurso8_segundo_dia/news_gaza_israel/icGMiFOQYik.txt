WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF GREEN ON
THE MAP RIGHT NOW. SO SOME GOOD
DRIVE TIMES FOR YOU AS YOU'RE
HEADING OUT THE DOOR. I'M RYAN
SILVA, FOX SEVEN TRAFFIC. THE
ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR IS ESCALATING
TENSIONS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST
AND THE WORLD. A SENIOR HAMAS
SAYS IT WILL TAKE FOR THE GROUP
TO ESTABLISH A CEASE FIRE. FOX'S
GARY BAUMGARTEN HAS THE STORY.
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU STILL SAYS A GROUND
INVASION INTO THE SOUTHERN GAZA
CITY OF RAFAH IS CRITICAL TO
ELIMINATING THE REMAINING HAMAS
STRONGHOLDS IN THE REGION. THIS
IS A SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL
SPEAKING TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
IN TURKEY, REVEALS THE TERROR
GROUP IS READY TO CONTINUE
CEASEFIRE NEGOTIATIONS. IF THEY
CAN'T FINISH HAMAS OFF, WHAT IS
THE SOLUTION? THE SOLUTION IS TO
GO TO CONSENSUS. WE HAVE
REPEATEDLY OFFERED THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF A FULLY
SOVEREIGN PALESTINIAN STATE.
HAMAS SAYS IT IS WILLING TO
AGREE TO A FIVE YEAR OR LONGER
TRUCE WITH ISRAEL, ADDING IT
WOULD LAY DOWN ITS WEAPONS AND
TRANSFORM INTO A POLITICAL
PARTY. BUT THAT'S IF AN
INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE IS
FORMED. THIS WOULD INCLUDE
TERRITORY IN THE WEST BANK, EAST
JERUSALEM AND GAZA. ISRAELI
OFFICIALS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO
ENTERTAIN THIS IDEA, ESPECIALLY
WITH MORE THAN 100 HOSTAGES
STILL IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY. UNTIL
HAMAS RELEASES THE HOSTAGES, THE
IDF WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE
HAMAS. IF WE ARE NOT ASSURED THE
WAR WILL END, WHY WOULD I HAND
OVER THE PRISONERS? BUT ANGER
OVER THE LACK OF PROGRESS
SURROUNDING THE HOSTAGES RELEASE
IS BOILING OVER. POLICE
ARRESTING PROTESTERS WEDNESDAY
NIGHT OUTSIDE THE HOME OF PRIME
MINISTER NETANYAHU IN JERUSALEM,
DEMONSTRATORS LIT FIRES IN THE
STREET AS HUNDREDS DEMANDED THE
