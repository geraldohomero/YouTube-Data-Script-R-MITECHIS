SOURCES CONSIDER THIS TO BE ONE 
OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GETS 
SINCE WAR WAS DECLARED ON 
OCTOBER 7.
THEY TOOK OUT A COMMANDER IN 
HAMAS NORTHERN BRIGADE.
THEY SAY HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
DIRECTING SOME OF THE ATTACKS OF
OCTOBER 7 THAT WERE LAUNCHED 
FROM THE NORTHERN PART OF THE 
GAZA STRIP AND THEY SAY IN 
TAKING HIM OUT, THEY BELIEVE 
THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED 
HAMAS'S ABILITY TO DISRUPT THE 
IDF GROUND OPERATION IN THE 
NORTHERN END OF THE GAZA STRIP.
THEY BELIEVE HE WAS A BIG PLAYER
IN HAMAS NORTHERN GAZA COMMAND.
GROUND OPERATION CONTINUE AND 
WHAT THE IDF APPEAR TO BE TRYING
TO DO IS ENCIRCLE GAZA CITY IN 
THE GAZA STRIP.
THEY HAVE GONE DOWN THE WESTERN 
SIDE OF GAZA AND COMING FROM THE
NORTH00 EAST AND APPEAR TO BE 
TRYING TO ENCIRCLE ENTIRETY OF 
GAZA CITY AND THEREFORE SQUEEZE 
THE HAMAS FIGHTERS BACK INTO THE
CENTER OF THAT CITY THEN THEY 
WILL TAKE THEM ON THE GROUND AND
IN THE TUNNELS.
WE ARE HEARING FROM THE IDF THAT
IS WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING, 
STRIKING HUNDREDS OF TARGETS 
ABOVE AND BELOW GROUND.
THE IDF VERY RELIEVED TO 
ANNOUNCE YESTERDAY THEY RESCUED 
ONE OF THEIR OWN, IDF SOLDIER 
KIDNAPPED ON OCTOBER 7, TAKEN 
INTO GAZA, RESCUED BY IDF FORCES
AND SHE IS REUNITED WITH HER 
FAMILY.
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU SAYS 
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO 
CONSIDERATION BEING GIVEN BY THE
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT TO A 
CEASEFIRE WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED 
FOR BY SOME PARTIES.
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU SAYS 
THAT WOULD BE AKIN TO UNITED 
STATES DECLARING CEASEFIRE IN 
THE IMMEDIATE WAKE OF PEARL 
HARBOR OR 9/11 ATTACK.
THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS THIS WAR
WILL CONTINUE MINUTE BY MINUTE, 
HOUR BY HOUR, DAY-BY-DAY UNTIL 
ISRAEL ACHIEVES TOTAL VICTORY.
