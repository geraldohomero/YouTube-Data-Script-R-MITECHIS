DO IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE "FOX 
AND FRIENDS" FAMILY FRIDAY.
>> Brian: ALL RIGHT, HOUSE 
REPUBLICANS ARE LAUNCHING AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE ANTI-WAR 
GROUP CODE PINK, DISRUPTED 
RECENT HEARINGS INCLUDING 
SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN.
>> Ainsley: AND WE'RE LEARNING 
ONE OF THE GROUP'S FOUNDERS MAY 
HAVE TIES TO COMMUNIST CHINESE 
PARTY.
>> Lawrence: OH, GREAT.
GRIFF JENKINS LIVE IN 
WASHINGTON.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
>> Griff: WE'RE LEARNING AND 
GOOD MORNING, GREAT SHOW IN 
NASHVILLE.
WE'RE LEARNING WHO IS BEHIND 
GROUPS LIKE CODE PINK 
SPECIFICALLY AND IT APPEARS THEY
ARE FAR LESS ORGANIC THAN MEETS 
THE EYE.
CODE PINK RALLY IN D.C. 
YESTERDAY, THAT WAS ORGANIZED BY
JODY EKNOW VAS.
I FIRST MET HER IN 2003, WHEN 
CODE PINK WAS FOUNDED TO OPPOSE 
GEORGE W BUSH'S WAR IN IRAQ.
IT IS NOW A MAJOR PLAYER ON THE 
PROTEST FRONT AND THEY HAVE DEEP
POCKETS BANK ROLLED BY JODY 
EVANS HUSBAND, WEALTHY TECH 
ENTREPRENEUR.
EVANS WAS LINKED TO PEOPLE'S 
FORUM, WHO CLAIMS TO ADVOCATE 
FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND
SOCIAL JUSTICE AND BEEN ACTIVE 
IN ORGANIZING FOUR OF THE BIG 
PROTESTS WE'VE SEEN IN D.C. AND 
NEW YORK IN RECENT WEEKS.
THIS COMES AS "NEW YORK TIMES" 
INVESTIGATION LINKED HER HUSBAND
TO FOUR NONPROFITS, WHICH PEDAL 
CHINESE COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA.
IN THE SUMMER EVANS MADE THE 
CASE PRESIDENT XI WAS NOT SUCH A
BAD GUY AFTERALL.
>> GOVERNING STRUCTURE OF CHINA 
IS SUCH THAT I -- YOU KNOW, 
AFTER LEARNING IT, REALIZING XI 
HAS LESS POWER THAN BIDEN.
>> Steve: 
>> Griff: HE'S NOT A SCARY GUY, 
SHE SAYS.
WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM?
FOLLOW THE MONEY, AN OLD ADAGE 
THAT HOLDS UP IN THIS CASE.
EVANS AND HER HUSBAND ARE QUITE 
THE POWER COUPLE IN THE 
SOCIALIST MARXIST CIRCLES IN 
BANKROLLING FAR LE
