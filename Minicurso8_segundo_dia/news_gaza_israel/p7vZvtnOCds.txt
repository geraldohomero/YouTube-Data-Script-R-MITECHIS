the altami family was at home when the
walls of their living room came crashing
down
the father had actually been watching
reports of the israeli airstrikes on
television
when the house was hit nermeen's
daughter's apartment which was only
built last month has also been
completely destroyed
where three families living in this home
my daughters came along with their kids
too
suddenly the power went off and we heard
violent bombardment
it was our first time to hear such a
sound the rubble suddenly started to
fall on us
and the kids were screaming they were
flying around us
the family left their home with little
more than the clothes they were wearing
at the time
and were taken first to hospital before
being transferred to a united nations
school
when the raids were extensive we went
down because my kids were afraid of the
upper floor
we got to the ground floor at my son's
home it was not destroyed yet
but then the raids got worse and we ran
to my brother-in-law's home right next
to ours
we ran from one home to another but it
was all frightening
my brother-in-law's home was destroyed
too it was the second day of eid
my kids didn't even get to wear their
new clothes
the altobees were among the first to
return to their homes
after the israeli airstrikes the
conflict may have ended for now
but many gazans have now to deal with
the damage and destruction coast
thousands of homes are gone and the
inhabitants displaced
they need food shelter and medical help
there are many scenes of destruction in
the gaza strip but only one result
thousands of palestinian families
suffering of almost two weeks of
bombardment
