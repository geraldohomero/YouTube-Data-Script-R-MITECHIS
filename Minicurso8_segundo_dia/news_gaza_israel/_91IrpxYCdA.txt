and lebanon continue to escalate the
israeli army has now claimed in a
statement that it has managed to shoot
down at least three drones that had been
launched by iran backed hezbollah adding
that these drones were headed towards a
gas field
in the mediterranean

they had shot down three drones that
were approaching israel's airspace in
its economic waters adding that these
drones were moving towards the carriage
gas field
one of the drones was intercepted by a
fighter jet while the other two were
brought down using warships

did not pose any risk whatsoever
meanwhile the iran bank hizbullah has
confirmed that they had indeed launched
these drones towards an offshore area

accomplished without addressing the
interception by the israeli army

when a vessel that was charted by israel
and operated by the greek energy firm

prime minister yan lapid issued a
warning to anyone
that wanted to threaten the country's
security

conflict and have no diplomatic
relations with each other the iraq

israel had fought a devastating war with
hezbollah back in 2006 and they did

as one of its principal enemies
