israeli police have fired tear gas and
stun grenades to disperse palestinian
protesters outside the historic ibrahimi
mosque in hebron city in the occupied
west bank protesters had gathered after
friday prayers against the israeli
construction plans at the mosque
palestinians accuse israel of trying to
destroy the islamic and historic nature
of the mosque the israeli defense
ministry on monday said it started a
project at the mosque's courtyards to
construct a separate passage and an
electric elevator the mosque is on
unesco's world heritage list chieftain
world's mustafa fatih has been covering
the protest outside the ibrahimi mosque
well right now we are in elkhaly also
known as hebron people just went out
from friday prayers today in
ibrahimo mosque today wasn't a normal
friday prayer because
some of the people in here are very
angry towards israeli government
because
israeli defense
security israel defense ministry said
they are going to build a construction
from the courtry arts of the mosque
to the parking lot and it's going to be
only for jews now it started
israeli police now using stun grenades
to
disperse the palestinian crowd and it
was expected it was a kind of an
expected situation because this place is
under occupation for years and the
mosque is really important for muslims
but the mosque is divided after
uh ibrahimovic mosque massacre that in
1996.
um unfortunately uh clashes has just
started you see the shraddha street this
street is very well known this place is
under israeli occupation fully now
israeli police
also attacking us
trying to push us
to be away from the mosque itself but
the clashes has started the reason why
the clash is happening here today is
that palestinians are really really
angry towards israeli government because
they want to
build a construction only for jews from
the
courtyards of the mosque to the parking
lot this place is on can only be used by
jews in 1996 this place was divided
after a massacre committed by a jew um
now after that jews are using the
courtyard and that's why israeli
government wants to
construct another kind of construction
and also a kind of elevator that's why
palestinians are furious palestinians
were calling other muslims to come in
here and
abraham mosque to pray inside and it was
a kind of expected situation it all just
started
