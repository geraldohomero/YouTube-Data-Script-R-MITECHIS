San Hamas or
Israel
the IDF launched an immediate
examination which was overseen at the
very highest levels of
command this professional review was
based on intelligence operation
intelligence operational systems and
aerial footage all of which which we
cross
checked the evidence which we are
sharing with you all confirm that the
explosion of the Hal madani Hospital in
Gaza was caused by an Islamic Jihad
rocket that was
misfired here are the four main parts of
the examination process first we
confirmed that there was no IDF Fire by
land sea or air that hit the
hospital second our radar system tracked
Rockets fired by terrorists from within
Gaza at the time of the
explosion I will show
you the trajectory analysis from the
barriage of rockets confirms that the
Rockets were fired close proximity to
the hospital
in addition there are two independent
videos which show the failure of the
rocket launch and the Contin
continuation of Rocket flight towards
the ground within the Gaza Street
falling in the hospital
compound third we have
intelligence some that will some that
will be shared here of communication
between terrorists talking about Rockets
misfiring the terrorists realize that
the rocket has misfired and made
specific reference to the
Alani hospital I would want to let
everybody hear the conversation and I
will do the translation in
English I'm telling you this is the
first time that we see missile like this
falling and so that why we are saying it
belong to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad
what they are saying it belongs to the
PGI it's from us it looks like it who
says this they are saying the the sharp
nail from the missile is local sharp
nail and not like Israeli sharp
nail what are you saying Abu
Amar but God bless it couldn't have been
found another place not the hospital to
explode
never mind yes abui they shot it from
the cemetery behind the hospital what
they shot it coming from the cemetery
behind the madani hospital and it
misfired and fell on them there's a
cemeter behind it yes El mahani is
exactly in the
compound where is it when the in when
when you enter the compound you first
enter the compound and don't go towards
the city it's on the right side of el
madani Hospital yes I know
