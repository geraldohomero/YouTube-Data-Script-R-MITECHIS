And see this we talk about this
Group Captain DK Pandey sir with us
DK Pandey sir exists here
Through we would like you to explain this
The photos were on which side of the movement
Why is the gaz towards the border but
Where is the focus on Gaza at this time
See in mind that this Gaza in North
The bandage was shown small here, this North
All towards North Gaza in five
There are two reasons for things that are happening
The focus of the tunnels which are also in this area
Why is it because the help given to them
This made with the help of Lebanon and Syria
Secondly if you attack here
So they will be easy to send those tunnels
And the two corridors that are given together
Corridor is Along the This border and another
Going from the middle so that you are from South
And go down to mind when
The tunnel here is being told
That number is between 30 and 50 and one
The tunnel is made of about $ 3 million
And how much items must have been put in it
How strong you are and this is the tunnel
This is the biggest in North Gaz
Watch the strength for Hamas because
In this, fighters are hidden and together
He made his furnishings rockets, etc.
Also take care that rockets fire now
They are happening from these tunnels and
It is said that their length is around 300
Is 500 km
