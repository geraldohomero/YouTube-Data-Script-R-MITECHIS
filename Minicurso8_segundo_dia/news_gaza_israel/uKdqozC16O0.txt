UN Security Council rejects
A resolution of Russia for a high
Fire in Gaza is
say we are taking all the
feelings of the last year and a half
Even irrational at the current point
Hey there is a resolution of the Council of
Security requested by
Russia and the Security Council rejects
That request simply because the high
to the fire that is requested comes from a
request of
Russia then look at the advice of
United Nations Security The Best
What can you do is already put a
Candadito and forget about him because already
We will be in this environment in which
nor the obvious seems to be
arrive at a
better agreement that they leave it for what
They will continue to gather
The entire diplomatic corps that is there
King's body living in New
York and and do not go quietly not the UN
Hey Security Council why because
is reflecting a completely time
different if they can't even
agree just because he has not said
Russia for the Ukraine War in a
a resolution of a high fire in
Gaza at the moment
Current turns off and let's
But this reflects the moment of
Multilateralism taken to two blocks
in which we are living China and Russia
They say not but you haven't heard me no
Not that you have not heard me not that no
I'm going to try it good now but not
You have heard me does not say this not such
way except to collect diets and
Living phenomenal in New York does not seem
That this security council right now
paint for more than for three images and
Look have come here but they are not going to
In accordance with the image at the level
Global is deplorable hey can for what
less see the nuances well than
be but how can there be a rejection of
SECURITY COUNCIL HIGH FIRE IN
Gaza not because Israel is
Saying good the follower
You have to ask for
peace has to ask for peace no
It was not a resolution
