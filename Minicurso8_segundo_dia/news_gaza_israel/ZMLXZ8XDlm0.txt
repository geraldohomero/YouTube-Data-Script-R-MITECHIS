PALESTINIAN SECURITY, BUT TO
ISREALI SECURITY.
YOU CAN'T DEFEAT THE DEPRESSED
PEOPLE MILITARILY.
IT'S WELL PAST TIME TO PUSH FOR
ONE.
>> DANIEL LEVY, THANK YOU FOR
YOUR TIME.
>>> THE DEMOCRATIC LED SENATE
PASSED SEVERAL BILLS WITH
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AIMING TO
PREVENT A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
AHEAD OF THE NOVEMBER 17
DEADLINE.
THAT DEADLINE IS FAST
APPROACHING.
IT'S TWO WEEKS FROM TOMORROW.
THE SENATE OVERWELMINGLY PASSED
THOSE FUNDING BILLS YESTERDAY
BY A VOTE OF 82-15.
MEANWHILE, THE REPUBLICAN
CONTROLLED HOUSE LED BY NEW
SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON, ALSO
PASSED SPENDING BILLS.
THEY ARE LOOKING TO CUT
SPENDING AND BREAK OFF AID TO
ISRAEL, PASSING THAT AS A
SEPARATE MEASURE.
CHUCK SCHUMER, A DEMOCRAT, SAYS
SUCH PARTISAN EFFORTS WILL GO
NOWHERE.
>>> THE HOUSE GOP PROPOSAL IS
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
IT IS GOING -- IT'S DEAD BEFORE
IT IS EVEN VOTED ON.
THE SPEAKER SHOULD START OVER.
THIS TIME WITHOUT TERRIBLE
PARTISAN BILLS.
THIS TIME SITTING DOWN WITH
DEMOCRATS AND WORKING THIS
ISSUE THROUGH.
>> NBC NEWS CONGRESSIONAL
CORRESPONDENT JOINS US NOW WITH
MORE.
JULIE, WHAT ARE GOING TO BE THE
CHALLENGES ON CAPITOL HILL WITH
THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN NOW
JUST OVER TWO WEEKS AWAY?
HOW FAR APART ARE THE SENATE
AND THE HOUSE?
>> EXTREMELY FAR APART.
YOU HEARD MAJORITY LEADER
SCHUMER.
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ISRAEL
BILL ONLY.
THE REASON HE WAS CALLING IT
PARTISAN IS BECAUSE HOUSE
SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON TIED
SPENDING CUTS TO THE IRS IN
ORDER TO PAY FOR ISRAEL'S BILL.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT WAS A
NONSTARTER.
SCHUMER, YOU HEARD HIM THERE
SAYING IT WAS DEAD BEFORE IT
WAS VOTED ON IN THE HOUSE.
THAT VOTE STILL EXPECTED TO
HAPPEN THIS WEEK, BUT THAT
BILL, LIKE SO MANY OTHERS GOING
NOWHERE IN THE SENATE AND THEN
YOU HAVE THE OVERALL PROBLEM OF
GOVERNMENT FUNDING, WHICH IS
JUST AROUND THE CORNER IN TWO
WEEKS.
IT'S MORE THAN CERTAIN IT IS
GOING TO NEED A SHORT-TERM
GOVERNMENT FUNDING MEASURE.
SPEAKER JOHNSON SAID AS MUCH
YESTERDAY.
AT THE SENATE REPUBLICAN LUNCH.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> WE ABSOLUTELY MUST ENSURE
THAT OUR MILITARY IS FULLY
STAFFED AND FULLY EQUIPPED TO
DEFEND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
AND IT BEGINS BY CONFIRMING
THESE VITAL NOMINATIONS THAT
ARE CURRENTLY ON HOLD.
EVERY DAY THAT THE SENATOR
CONTINUES HIS BLANKET HOLDS,
OUR MILITARY PREPAREDNESS IS
DEGRADED.
>> IT'S A LONG NIGHT IN THE
