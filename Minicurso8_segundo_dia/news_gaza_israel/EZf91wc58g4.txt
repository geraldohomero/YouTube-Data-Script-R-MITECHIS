>>> HEY, EVERYBODY, WE ARE BACK
WITH THE SECOND HOUR OF "CHRIS
JANSING REPORTS."
I'M YASMIN VOSSOUGHIAN.
HAPPENING AT THIS HOUR, TWO
ISRAELI HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN
RELEASED TODAY WITH MORE TO
COME, ACCORDING TO THE ISRAELI
MILITARY.
THIS NEW VIDEO FROM AL JAZEERA
SHOWING 21-YEAR-OLD MIA SHEM,
WHOSE FACE YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE
WE KNOW EVERYONE OPERATES UNDER
ONE IMPRESSION ABOUT THE
WHEREABOUTS OF INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE
AND SUDDENLY IT CHANGES AT THE
HARDEST AND MOST VULNERABLE
MOMENT.
>> VERY DEVASTATING FOR THAT
FAMILY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT TWO OF THE
OTHER HOSTAGES THAT WERE
RELEASED.
THE NAMES BEING RELEASED TODAY
AS WELL.
TALK TO ME MORE ABOUT WHAT WE
KNOW OF THEM.
>> YEAH, SO THERE HAVE BEEN TWO
HOSTAGES RELEASED SO FAR TODAY,
40-YEAR-OLD AMIT SUSANNA AND MIA
SCHEM.
SHE WAS KIDNAPPED AT THE NOVA
MUSIC FESTIVAL.
WE ACTUALLY -- NBC NEWS SPOKE
WITH HER MOTHER KAREN SCHEM IN
ADVANCE OF HER RELEASE, BEFORE
WE KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BE
RELEASED.
WE NEVER KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE
RELEASED UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY
ARE RELEASED.
THIS IS WHAT KAREN SCHEM HAD TO
SAY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE
EVENTUAL REUNION OF HER
DAUGHTER.
>> I DON'T THINK I WILL SPEAK, I
WILL JUST HOLD HER AND HUG HER.
I WON'T ASK QUESTIONS, THAT'S
FOR SURE.
AND I JUST WANT TO HOLD HER.
>> Reporter: THESE ARE TWO
HOSTAGES OUT OF AN EXPECTED TEN
THAT WE ARE WAITING TO SEE
RELEASED TONIGHT.
AS YOU POINTED OUT, THE CEASE
FIRE HAS BEEN EXTENDED DAY BY
DAY.
WE ARE AWARE THAT THERE ARE
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO EXTEND THE
CEASE FIRE FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO
DAYS, ALLOWING FOR THE RELEASE
OF AN ADDITIONAL 20 HOSTAGES.
WE DO NOT HAVE CONFIRMATION THAT
THAT EXTENSION HAS ACTUALLY
TAKEN PLACE.
THAT IS THE MAIN THING WE'RE
GOING TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO
HERE ON THE GROUND IN THE HOURS
