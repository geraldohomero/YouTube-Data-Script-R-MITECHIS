wel thank you for having
this
[Music]
[Music]
in these dark hours my country stands by
the people of Israel from day one our
message has been
clear Israel has the right to defend
itself against the terror of Hamas and
all hostages must be released this cruel
crime must end
[Music]
now by fighting Hamas terrorists Israel
is pursuing a legitimate goal never
again and October
7 the longer the war lasts the higher
the number of Civilian casualties
Rises the more desperate the situation
of the people in Gaza become the more
this begs the question no matter how
important the goal can it justify such
terribly high costs or are there other
ways to achieve your
goal take the ground of fastive in
Rafa the military logic is one
consideration but there is a
humanitarian logic as
well
[Music]
that's
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
we cannot stand by and watch
Palestinians risk
starvation that's not us that is not
what we stand for
together much more humanitarian Aid is
needed continuously
reliably I shared my concerns with the
Prime Minister that provision of aid
from Israel into Gaza and the conditions
for distribution must be urgently and
massively
improved
[Music]
uh you express your concern for two
things one protecting civilians and
second uh provision of uh humanitarian
Aid and I explained that these are our
concerns as well uh because we agree
with both goals in fact the army of
Israel has done more to minimize
civilian casualties than any other Army
in modern times secondly we are doing uh
unusual efforts to increase humanitarian
Aid by land by sea by air and we'll
continue to do
more
as far as the perspective is concerned
we need to discuss this further we do
not have the same views on this but that
is precisely why it is important to say
that without hope without the prospect
of the possibility of self-government
the possibility of long-term peace is
much more difficult and that I believe
is what I have succeeded in making clear
you just
got
