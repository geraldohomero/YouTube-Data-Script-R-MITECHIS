HE'S FACING A LOT OF QUESTIONS
NOW.
THERE'S REAL SENSE IN THE BIDEN
WHITE HOUSE THAT HIS DAYS
POLITICALLY ARE SNURMNUMBERED.
THEY SUSPECT HE'LL KEEP HIS
POSITION THROUGH THE FIRST WAVE
OF THE WAR, BUT POLLS SUGGEST
ISRAELIS WANT A NEW LEADER.
>> LET'S GO TO THE ISRAEL-GAZA
BORDER.
CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT
RICHARD ENGEL IS THERE.
WEIGH IN ON THIS TOPIC OF PRIME
MINISTER NETANYAHU AND ALSO THE
LATEST ON THE ISRAELI PUSH
INSIDE GAZA.
>> Reporter: SO THE PRIME
MINISTER'S CAREER IS DEFINITELY
IN TROUBLE.
THERE IS ANGER BUILDING AGAINST
HIM.
EVERY TIME HE SPEAKS TO LOCAL
PRESS OR FOREIGN PRESS, HE IS
FACING QUESTIONS, WHETHER HE
SHOULD RESIGN, WHETHER HE WILL
ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR
FAILING TO ANTICIPATE THE
ATTACKS OF OCTOBER 7th, AND
FAILING TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY
MANNER.
THESE ATTACKS THAT TOOK PLACE ON
THAT DAY TOOK PLACE OVER THE
COURSE OF SEVERAL HOURS, WHERE
HAMAS WAS ABLE TO GO FROM
COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY
BUTCHERING PEOPLE, TAKING
HOSTAGES.
NOW, SOME ISRAELIS ARE SAYING
THAT HE IS DOING THIS CAMPAIGN
TO BOTH ATTACK HAMAS BUT ALSO TO
TRY AND SAVE HIS OWN POLITICAL
CAREER, POTENTIALLY AT THE
EXPENSE OF THE HOSTAGES.
THERE ARE, EVERY NIGHT IN
TEL-AVIV, VIGILS BY THE FAMILIES
OF THE HOSTAGES.
THEY'RE TRYING TO STAY
APOLITICAL, TRYING NOT TO
CRITICIZE THE GOVERNMENT, BUTNET
THEY SAY, "ONE DAY WHEN THIS IS
OVER, WE WILL EXPRESS OUR
OPINIONS ABOUT THE PRIME
MINISTER AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE
DONE."
IN A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT, THE
FIRST HOSTAGE HAS BEEN FREED BY
ISRAELI TROOPS.
ISRAELI TROOPS OPERATING IN
GAZA.
A YOUNG ISRAELI WOMAN, SHE WAS
TAKEN BY HAMAS FROM A GUARD
TOWER IN A KIBBUTZ.
12 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN THE
ATTACK AND SEVERAL OTHERS ALONG
WITH HER REMAIN AS HOSTAGES.
BUT INSIDE GAZA, ONE THING THAT
CANNOT BE MENTIONED -- IS
IMPORTANT TO MENTION, HE TALKED
ABOUT A SAFE ZONE IN SOUTHERN
GAZA.
OUR REPORTERS IN GAZA SAY THERE
IS NOTHING LIKE A SAFE ZONE.
ISRAELI STRIKES CONTINUE ALL
ACROSS THE GAZA STRICK,
INCLUDING IN THE SOUTH.
