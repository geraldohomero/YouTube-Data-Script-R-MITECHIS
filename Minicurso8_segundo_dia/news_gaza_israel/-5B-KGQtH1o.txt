on Monday the Israeli military released
footage of what it says were more than
300 separate strikes carried out on
Targets in Gaza in the previous 24 hours
one of the most intense bombardments of
the last two
weeks targets May belong to Hamas but
the collateral damage is becoming
obvious the Hamas run Health Ministry
said more than 400 Palestinians were
killed Israeli military also confirmed a
limited operation by Ground Forces
Crossing into Gaza overnight on
Sunday these are raids that go deep to
the contact line these raids also locate
and search for anything we can get in
terms of Intelligence on the missing and
the
hostages but pressure on Israel to delay
its main ground incursion is growing
there are international calls for some
kind of ceasefire to let Aid in and to
get Israel's hostages out we will
discuss also about uh
the call for the United Nations about an
humanitarian P which is also needed even
for the giving back the hostages the
attacks of missiles Rockets from
Hamad Gaza has to
stop the
hostages the people have being kidnapped
has to be release EU leaders will meet
on Thursday with reports their final
communic will formally call for such a
humanitarian
pause a trickle of Aid has started
coming through the Raffa Crossing from
Egypt like this being delivered to a un
School in carun but it's nowhere near
the 100 trucks a day Gaza normally gets
we need a constant stream of Aid pouring
in bringing the water food medicine and
fuel that is so desperately needed so we
will keep up the Diplomatic
pressure the calls for humanitarian Aid
are getting louder but not at the
expense of support for Israel's wider
goal of destroying Hamas that means any
pause in the strikes will only be
temporary Simon McGregor wood trt
