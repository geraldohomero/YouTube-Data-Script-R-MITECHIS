Since the kidnapping and murder of
Young Mohamed in Bourdeilles Hirt we know
Now that he has been burned alive
Fear is felt throughout the neighborhood
from Chouafat to East Jerusalem Fear of
new abductions afraid of
Insecurity
never feels more safe and we
Go protesting we're not going to be silent
promises this woman as mayor if
We could we would have destroyed our
hands we don't want Israelis
life is here
Some even accuse the police
Israeli to cover the authors of
RAPT and murder of the young Palestinian
He recalls by showing us that the
district is full of dozens of
surveillance cameras
Yassine is the cousin of the young father
Mohamed there is laxity on the part of
Israeli security services for
stop the culprits because they
know their identity and the car
which was used to kidnap it a
male and other actors having the status
permanent resident and paying
same taxes as the Israelis they
Palestinians from Chouafat feel
subject to the goodwill of the authorities of
The Hebrew State
All this on a land that they
consider theirs
Palestinians defend their rights
legitimate is Palestine's land
And it is their right to defend their
earth but we in Jerusalem we do not
has that stones we have neither
weapons or anything for us
defend the district still bears the
Stigmata of the fighting which opposed
this week young Palestinians and
Israeli police
The tram stations in the neighborhood were
destroyed and trains do not circulate
more
Luis Carballo Specially sent this line
of tram connects the city center
From Jerusalem to the colonies in the North
passing through several districts
Arab wanted at the start by the town hall of
the city as a unity project its
partial destruction during these three
days of clashes shows that this
unit only exists on paper by
The UN
