This was the boyfriend.
Body parts [dismembered]
We are taking out human parts.
I worry about each
As if it were my brother.
Subject to a little girl
 As if it were my daughter.
There are some there.
Pull him.
Pull him, like that.
Tonight I tell my colleagues
I want to lie down
on the couch.
If the pumps reach us,
for the love of God,
Let's not let it get stuck
The excavator.
You have to act little by little,
As I do, sideways ...
Don't worry about us
because...
We understand our situation,
will make us fly,
They are going to destroy us.
We are tired.
Come, wrap her, wrap her.
[Respect] his dignity
Wrap it and take it out.
My brothers,
I'm sure that
If we find one
We will find the others gathered.
As members of civil defense
We are afraid.
We walk
No international protection
No laws
of humanitarian protection.
We work by saying
"At this moment they will bombard us."
how they bombarded our colleagues.
We say goodbye
of 6 of our partners
and 2 are still under intensive care.
The places
They are very, very difficult
For our work.
While we work
at a site,
They bombard it again.
We have no supplies.
There is no protection.
Nothing remains.
Half of our trucks
They are out of service.
Also half of
Rescue vehicles
Our conditions are really hard.
We do it with nothing.
The missiles that do not stop launching
They are difficult.
They're very difficult.
The shattered bodies
They dismembered.
I found...
to a second sister
Of the waist below was buried,
His face was injured
and bleeding.
I can not give it medical assistance,
 I can't dig with my hands.
It is not common to find
Under the rubble
To people alive.
I don't look for martyrs,
I'm looking for living people.
With all our respect
and honor, glory and love
Towards the martyrs.
But the living have priority
About the dead.
We ask the Almighty God
that gives us strength
and strengthen our determination
and strengthen our will.
And we will overcome it, if God allows it.
