Kanaani firmly denied participation
From Iran and criticized the military presence
American in the region
considering it a threat to peace and
Regional stability the government
American has been exacerbating the
instability and insecurity in the
region and in terms of the presence of
American naval fleet in the middle
East we see it as part of its
policies to continue supporting
Israel Israel never agreed to extend
The truce in the Gaza Strip for two
More days this is what is at least
Officer out there we will see more
