I greet Estela Díaz Barriga
family of one of the Mexicans who
comes in this second flight that is for
landing I said in approximately
An hour thank you very much for your
time eh Madam Estela is already ready
There to receive your daughter
So yes Alejandro we are very very
excited waiting to see her and hug her
and wish him that all this experience
eh is quick to start a
New cycle in his life what his daughter did
there in Israel I understand that I already had
Time living
There really does she really 10 years ago
He began to go to Israel to a project
called Magdala Magdala Center she is
archaeologist and was as a coordinator
And as an assistant and as a volunteer in
This project and the University of
Telavid offered him a
scholarship to study the mastery in the
University of Telavid and well very
honest we said yes
Stay 4 years ago the
Master's degree
Graduó was working on some
Excavations in Megido in
mazada and other archaeological sites and
she was already waiting in this
year I was already delivering his
Documentation to do doctoral
that also the University of Tel Aviv
Well, he offered him that opportunity and then
Look Alejandro what things are
situation because he forced her to return if
forced her to return to say that
This process interrupts a bit
academic in which he was already
had advanced as the mastery tells us
for starting the doctorate she returns
Alone or return accompanied from Israel
Well look like she didn't have in
mind to return on these flights because
Well, he has his heart on in
Israel many friends many teachers in
The university but there is a person
whom she wants very much appreciated
an elder lady who is Mrs. Silvia
And then they asked him to accompany her
Because the lady could not travel alone
And well it was for us
also a relief because she was a
Little undecided and then said Okay Mami Me
I will accompany Mrs. Silvia and
I arrive on the second plane as soon as we
He warned yesterday they will imagine the
family's joy of course
have it back and how good
Help Mrs. Silvia to return not
accompanied on this second flight then
We will be attentive in the next
minutes will land and can hug
Nua account, I thank you
You don't have a lot of Alejandro to
Contrary to spread good news
