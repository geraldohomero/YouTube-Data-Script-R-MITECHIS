We are in the Kibu de Farasa
Located about 3 km from the Gaza Strip

inhabitants of this Israeli community
They suffered one of the greatest killings
by never lost 64
Neighbors and 19 were kidnapped day
Today 11 of them have been released
Among these amit Susana a lawyer of
40 years that for the first time speak here
About those 55 days like
Rehend a physical and emotional terror
During the 55 days I was in
captivity feeling that every moment
It could be the last all guards
They were strongly armed and abused
of me and other hostages I was also
retained in a tunnel ever at 40 m from
depth without oxygen and very little
Susana food lived in this area of
Kibutz known as the neighborhood of the
Young people what relatives and testimonies
describe as a place with a character
Vibrant of great party music
now it has become like we can
verify in silence with the noise of
some airplanes or bombings in the
Gaza Strip in fact we can also
observe the houses that have remained
burned and also some objects
Personal that are scattered
around the kibutz so what to
Some have become a place of
pilgrimage to which you have to enter
With a permission for inhabitants and
relatives is a way to travel the
mourning and also demanding the release of
The 132 reeens that are still
Captive in

Kidnapped this is the fourth time that

It happened here to preserve the memory of the
