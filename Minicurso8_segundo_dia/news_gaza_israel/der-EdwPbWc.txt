hi as we speak people in Gaza are dying
they are not only dying from bombs and
strike soon many more will die from the
consequences of Siege imposed on the
Gaza
Street basic services are
crumbling medicine is running out food
and water are running out the street of
Gaza have started overflowing with swich
Gaza is on the brink of a massive Health
aard at the risk of diseases are
looming I warn that we will not be able
to continue our imal operation if we do
not get the fuel
supply my warning still stands over the
last few days un has drastically limited
its consumption of fuel but this came at
a cost our team had to make tough
decision that no human workers should
do what needs more support
bakeries water station life support
machine in their
hospital all this needs fuel to
function The Siege means that food water
and fuel all basic Commodities are being
used to collectively punish more than 2
million people among them a majority of
children and
mov these fewel trucks are nothing more
than a cramps that will not make a
difference for the 2 million people in
the
street we should avoid conveying the
message that few trucks a day means The
Siege is lifted for humanitarian Aid
this is not true the current system in
place is geared to fail what is needed
is Meaningful and
uninterrupted Aid flow and to succeed we
need an human turn fire to ensure this
Aid reaches those in
need as far as un is concerned we have
fuel for today now there is a place
where there is fuel which was a fuel
based on the agreement between Israel
and Qatar fuel being brought in by Egypt
I guess you are referring to this fuel
if we have access to this fuel we will
have access only through the confliction
with Israel there might be some fuel
available that would bring us for one or
two more days the quantity of fuel we
need for the operation I indicated
before is 160,000 lit a day to supply
our partners the hospitals the bakeries
and for our own
operation
