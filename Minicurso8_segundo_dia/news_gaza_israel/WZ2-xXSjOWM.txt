T
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO WATCH THE MARKETS
CAREFULLY.
>> THIS LEVEL OF SILENCE FROM
YOU GUYS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS REALLY NO.
I HEARD WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY BUT
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY?
BECAUSE THE OFFICIAL LINE WE ARE
NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS,
THAT IS THE LINE.
THAT IS THE CHOICE.
IS IT PART OF YOUR STRATEGY TO
DE-ESCALATE?
>> AGAIN, I WILL BE SUPER
MINDFUL.
I GET THE INTEREST, OBVIOUSLY I
UNDERSTAND THE INTEREST.
AND I WILL BE DISAPPOINTING MANY
PEOPLE HERE THIS AFTERNOON.
I JUST DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO
SHARE.
I WILL NOT SPECULATE ON THE
REPORTING'S OUT THERE.
YOU HEARD THE SAME.
OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
SAYING THIS MORNING YOU HEARD
FROM SECRETARY BLINKEN AND YOU
ASK AS WELL ABOUT THE ESCALATION
I WILL SPEAK MORE GENERALLY.
WE HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY CLEAR
FROM HERE FROM THE BEGINNING
THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS
CONFLICT ESCALATE.
WE CONTINUE TO CONSULT WITH OUR
ALLIES AND PARTNERS INCLUDING IN
THE REGION, OBVIOUSLY, AND
REDUCE FURTHER RISK OF
ESCALATION IN THE REGION AND
THAT IS EXPRESSED IN THE G7
FOREIGN MINISTRY'S JOINT
STATEMENT THAT WENT OUT THIS
MORNING.
YOU HEARD THAT OBVIOUSLY FROM
SECRETARY BLINKEN WHO WAS PART
OF THAT MEETING.
I WILL BE SUPER MINDFUL AND I
WILL NOT SPECULATE OR SPEAK TO
ANY OF THE REPORTING'S THAT ARE
OUT THERE AT THIS TIME.
>> EARLIER THIS MONTH
PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID IF ISRAEL
DOES NOT CHANGE HIS APPROACH
WITH REGARD TO GAZA THEN THE
U.S. WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE ITS
APPROACH SO CAN YOU BRING US UP
TO SPEED IN WHAT ISRAEL HAS DONE
OTHER THAN THE STEPS IT
ANNOUNCED IN THE IMMEDIATE HOURS
AFTER THE PRESIDENT?
>> LOOK, WE ARE CONTINUING TO
HAVE CONVERSATIONS OBVIOUSLY
WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS IN ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT.
YOU KNOW WE PUT A READOUT OF THE
RAW FUND MEETING YESTERDAY.
IT WAS A CONSTRUCTIVE MEETING.
OBVIOUSLY THE READOUT SPEAKS FOR
ITSELF AND AS IT SAYS THE
UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL AGREED
ON THE SHARED OBJECTIVE TO SEE
HAMAS DEFEATED IN RAFA
CONTINUING TO EXPRESS WITH
COURSES AND ISRAELI PARTICIPANTS
AGREED TO TAKE THESE ACCOUNTS
INTO CONSIDERATION AND BETWEEN
EXPERTS SO AS IT RELATES TO THAT
WE WILL HAVE MORE TO SHARE AND
CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE OF THOSE
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT -- GO WITH THE
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND O
