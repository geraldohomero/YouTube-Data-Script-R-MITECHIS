We are determined to keep moving forward with this
It will happen wherever there is violence and it is We'll find one too
In the south, it will happen on time and in conditions
The best
To the shade
It's just her
The beginning and the beginning are in the north The city
Gaza is the center of gravity of the Homs regime and there
We chose
Act north
Right now, we're hoping as clean as we can
We are not involved because that is the goal we are
We are very excited to know how to deal with it, especially
No injuries or injuries to non-combatants It will
The turn of the south and the turn of the center will come in all its time
As I said, it's a setup

We've been facing a lot of stress for weeks
There is a huge international ceasefire to come
Humanitarian pauses and all without the release of abductees
And the Prime Minister He also spoke with the president
Biden also talks with all the leaders and around him
All the cabinet ministers are special that this thing is gone
Possible And that's why we're on the 42nd day of fighting
We did not agree to order the soldiers to stop
The progress of even pulling hands
The normal minute The key is when we know itâ€™s possible
Release abductees, not manipulative release and not
Release for public relations purposes except
Massive release Only then will we agree
A ceasefire will be short and limited
After that, we will continue to fight That one
This is also the continuation of the campaign for liberation
