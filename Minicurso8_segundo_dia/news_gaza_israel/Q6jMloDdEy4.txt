From these boxes there are medicines and others
indispensable supplies supplies for
this hospital the most important of the
North of
Gaza after the Shifa hospital
It would stop working many
patients to the Camal health center

small here we lack medicines and
Supplies we turn to organizations
internationals such as WHO and thanks to
God we receive
provisioning the aid continues
reaching gauze but agencies
humanitarian say it is not enough
For the needs of the population
After international pressures the
Benjam√≠n Netanyahu government has
approved increase aid entry in
gauze a decision that occurs after
Death this week of several cooperators
In an Israeli attack yet the
security is still essential for
the agencies operating in
GASA we have no security guarantees
to work
Here people need to be safe
so that we can really expand
our help and that people do not die
For lack of food we demand
security guarantees both for
us as humanitarian workers
as for the people we attend

In northern Gaza according to the program
United Nations World Cup
A 70 by the population already suffers the
Oxfam NGOs states that since January the
Palestinians in northern Gaza ingest
an average of only 245 calories a day
less than a can of
beans when we were displaced to
start war the high prices of
Food forced us to eat bread
rotten this is the only place where
I can get food for my children
Three children and a girl need food
But where can I not allow myself
Buying food is very expensive and not
I have money this local kitchen is the
only sure place we come here all

Many gauze inhabitants months
After starting the war a
suffering that
