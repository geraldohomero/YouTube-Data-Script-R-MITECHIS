thank you Mr
President in a world where differences
and disputes should be resolved by
dialogue this August body should be
deeply concerned at recourse to
violence that too when it happens on a
scale and intensity that is an affront
to basic human
values violence as a means to achieve
political objective objectives damages
indiscriminately and does not pave the
way for any durable
Solutions the terror attacks in Israel
on 7th October were shocking and deserve
condemnation our thoughts are also with
those taken hostages we call for their
immediate and unconditional
release terrorism is a malignancy and
knows no borders nationality or race the
world should not buy into any
justification of Terror
acts let us keep aside differences unite
and adopt a zero tolerance approach to
terrorism Mr President casualties in the
ongoing CL conflict in Gaza are a
telling serious and continuing
concern civilians especially women and
children are paying with their
lives this humanitarian crisis needs to
be
addressed we welcome the international
community's deescalation efforts and
delivery of humanitarian assistance to
the people of
Gaza India too has contributed to this
effort Mr President India is deeply
concerned at the deteriorating security
situation and astounding loss of
Civilian lives in the ongoing
conflict the escalation of hostilities
in the region will only exacerbate the
humanitarian crisis
it is necessary for all parties to
display the utmost
responsibility Mr President India has
always supported a negotiated two State
solution to the Israel Palestine issue
leading to the establishment of a
sovereign independent and viable state
of Palestine living within secure and
recog recognized borders side by side in
peace with Israel
for this we urge the parties to
deescalate isue violence and work
towards creating conditions for an early
resumption of direct peace
negotiations we hope that the
deliberations of this assembly will send
a clear message Against Terror and
violence and expand prospects for
diplomacy and dialogue while addressing
the humanitarian crisis that confronts
us I thank you
