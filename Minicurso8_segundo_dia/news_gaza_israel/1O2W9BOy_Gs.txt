this man's family has lived in abu
kranath village in israel's negev desert
for hundreds of years
ratib still lives there today
but the village has not been recognized
by the government and in january israel
said it wants to use the land for its
own projects
if they start working on this project
there is no other option i will lose my
home it will affect my children and my
family
ratib and his family will be far from
the only ones affected we are in ukraine
at village about two kilometers away
from a weapon testing facility but
israel wants to move it to this village
and rights groups say it would lead to
the eviction of about 1 000 people
israel says it wants to move people in
these villages to legal settlements and
its bidwin settlement authority director
says
this new plan will give people access to
services the government denies their
unrecognized towns but activists say the
israeli government has been staking
claim to this lands for decades in the
1950s it started forcibly relocating
arab bedouins it refused to recognize
their rights to their ancestral lands
and declared their buildings illegal
lawyer missana morani says these latest
plans are part of that wider policy of
forced displacement the main aim of this
policy is judaization
the the negev
and the and it's combined with other
policies that
contribute
to
to building more uh
jewish settlements in the in the native
that video are not allowed to live in
for decades bedouins in the negev have
demanded recognition
and rights groups have also objected to
israel's plans but for now israel
doesn't seem willing to budge
