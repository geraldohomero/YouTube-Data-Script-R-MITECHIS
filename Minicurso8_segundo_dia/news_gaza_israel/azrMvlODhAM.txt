u.s president joe biden's west asia trip
will go down as one of the most crucial
meetings of this year it was his maiden
visit to the region and the past is
evidence that the visit of any u.s
president in this region has had a long
lasting impact
so biden did everything in his power to
build relations and improve the souring
ones
from fist bumps to laughing together
one such unique exchange happened when
he met his israeli counterpart an
expected issue that surfaced during the
meeting was a decades-old palestine
conflict
biden used a comparison that is being
healed by some in raising eyebrows for
others he compared the plight of
palestinians to that
in irish catholics under britain
before we tell you more listen in
i
my background
in the background of my family is irish
american
and
we
have a
long history
of uh
not fundamentally unlike the palestinian
people
with great britain and their attitude
toward irish catholics
over the years for 400 years
biden has been known to hail his irish
roots but time and again this the time
and place of this one is a little
bizarre almost like biden was looking
for something in his own life to narrate
the hardship of palestinians a quick
recap of history for all of you in
colonial times britain has been known
for its violent past in ireland
so was biden accusing israel of
committing violent crimes against the
palestinians this also complicates the
politics around which land belongs to
whom this is a core issue in israel and
palestine's conflict so by comparing
israel to britain and ireland to
palestine is biden calling israel's
presence and occupation
the statement can potentially anger the
us's closest ally in the region speaking
of allies for decades
britain has been seen as an all-weather
ally of washington in an attempt to
build new relations in west asia experts
are hopeful that byron won't end up
hurting existing friends
because if he does so an angry congress
back home surely awaits him
