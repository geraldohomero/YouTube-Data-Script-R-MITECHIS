We know that the strikes intensify
Throughout the territory therefore no
only to the north but but also
now in the South, notably on
cities of Ranunnes which is the city where
are refugees a good part of
inhabitants of the north of the enclave on
the order of the Israeli army there is
it several weeks and then in the
North The situation also remains
extremely complicated for civilians
Who are always we learned in particular
What about 30,000 Palestinians have gone
take refuge in the ruins of the hospital
Alchifa this hospital we had a lot
OUP talk in recent weeks
since this is where Israel considered
that Hamas hid its center of
Command in the tunnels below
From this hospital it was an area of
particularly intense fight in the month
last and therefore now civilians
will take refuge in the middle of the ruins of
These fights the humanitarian situation
remains catastrophic in all
the Palestinian enclave while in
parallel and well the capacities of
Hamas strike remain active since
this morning again Hamas struck
Several rascal salve on the
center of Israel there have been several
ground impacts according to the media
Israelis and then uh it is also necessary
evoke the fate of the 137 hostages
Israelis still retained in the band
of Gaza yesterday Abou Obeidda which is the
Alkkassam brigade spokesperson
Hamas armed branch made a rare
Declaration was an audio message
in particular broadcast by the chain
Aljazira he reaffirmed that there would be
No hostage release living uh
negotiation
This follows in particular to a
Israeli attempt to release a
hostage by force it was there is
a few days a failed attempt two
Israeli soldiers were killed and this
hostage A 25 -year -old young man has him
also was killed according to Israel by his
Jeleliers Le Hamas has published a video
in which we see the lifeless body
of this young man and the Kibut of Berry
of which he was from then
asserted that yes it was a question of
Saha Barour and then finally the balance sheet
also increases on the army side
Israeli since she communicates this
morning saying that 104 Israeli soldiers
have been killed since the start of
the terrestrial offensive and then there is
also in the Israeli ranks 582
