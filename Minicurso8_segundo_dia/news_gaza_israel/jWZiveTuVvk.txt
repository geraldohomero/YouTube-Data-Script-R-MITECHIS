Israel is at
War we are in a war and we did not
choose to start this war it's an evil
that not created even by the devil Hamas
executed an historical Massacre that the
world will not forget there is no
dispute in regards to the land of Gaza
we gave the pal inan Gaza till the last
millimeter there is no dispute I want to
assure you that we will defeat teror
because we have no other choice we
demand the Hamas not to harm any of the
hostages their safety is their
responsibility Israel is at
War we are in a war and we did not
choose
to start this
war but we are
facing a vicious ter organization Hamas
it's an evil that not created even by
the
devil I think that
the in the last
decades I don't think that we saw such
sins
maybe only in Isis what they
did but here it was not just when Isis
did it for men and woman but to take a
85 years old Holocaust Survivor on a
wheelchair to
captive even
between the war between Russia and
Ukraine we did not
so murdering entire
families taking in
captive small
childrens and putting them in
cages it's vicious and evilness that I
think that the world did
not saw before and I think that the
only times that we saw it it's only with
the
Nazis and maybe with with the
Isis Hamas is the proxy of
Iran Hamas executed an historical
Massacre that the world will not forget
there is no dispute in regards to the
land of Gaza we gave the Palestinian
Gaza till the last millimeter there is
no dispute in regards to the land I want
to assure you that we will defeat teror
because we have no other
choice we have no other
choice there are many Israeli and
also others from different nationalities
which held in ostage
we are committed to bring them
back in the spirit of mutual
responsibility we demand the Hamas not
to harm any of the
hostages their safety is their
responsibility this war crime will not
be
forgiven
we will continue with all the might and
me to fight for our homeland and we will
win
