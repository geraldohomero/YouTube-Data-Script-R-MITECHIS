LEBANON.
>> Carley: THANK YOU.
BRING IN RICH McCORMACK WHO IS A
FORMER MARINE PILOT AND 
EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN.
WE COULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT 
DIFFERENT THINGS.
WHY THIS ATTACK IS HAPPENING AND
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HELD AN
ALL-SENATORS BRIEFING YESTERDAY 
ON THIS AND FOX NEWS OBTAINED A 
READ OUT OF IT AND VICTORIA 
NEWLAND SAID ONE REASON THIS 
ATTACK TOOK PLACE WAS BECAUSE OF
SAUDI ARABIA SAYING IT APPEARS 
ALL PROGRESS HAS BEEN LOST AS 
THE CROWN PRINCE MADE COMMENT 
SUPPORTING PALESTINE.
>> SAD TO HEAR, YOU CAN SEE IRAN
THUMB PRINT ALL OVER THIS.
I HATE TO HEAR THAT.
I HAVE DONE OPERATIONS IN AND 
AROUND SAUDI ARABIA, TO SEE THAT
RELATIONSHIP DEVELOP WILL 
UNDERMINE ABRAHAM ACCORD AND I 
HATE TO SEE THAT.
>> Todd: SPEAKING OF IRAN, 20 
GOP SENATORS CALLING TO REFREEZE
THE $6 BILLION.
THE MONEY IS AVAILABLE FOR 
HUMANITARIAN USE AND MONEY IS 
                              
FUNGIBLEAND COULD BE USED 
AGAINST ISRAEL.
DO YOU INDIVIDUALLY SUPPORT 
THIS?
>> ABSOLUTELY, I THINK IT WILL 
BE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY SUPPORTED 
BY THE HOUSE.
I SUPPORT IT.
WE NEED TO HAVE ADDITIONAL 
SANCTIONINGS.
THIS GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE 
SQUEEZED.
IT IS A PROXY BY IRAN.
ECONOMICALLY, STRATEGICALLY, 
THIS GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE 
PUNISHED WHERE IT MISSTEPPED.
>> Carley: THE HOUSE SPEAKER 
VOTE HAPPENS TODAY.
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?
>> WE HAD GOOD PROGRESS LAST 
NIGHT IN CLOSED SESSION.
THIS IS NEW GROUND, NEVER BEEN 
DONE BEFORE, WE THINK THE 
SPEAKER PRO TEM CAN BE USED 
APPROPRIATELY.
>> Todd: ASSUMING THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEM, DOES NOT HAVE THOSE 
CAPABILITIESES AND YOU NEED A 
SPEAKER WHO IS IT LOOKING LIKE 
IT WILL BE STEVE SCALISE, JORDAN
OR ONE KEVIN McCARTHY.
>> KEVIN McCARTHY WAS HUMBLE AND
GRACIOUS LAST NIGHT.  WE WILL 
SOLVE THIS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.
MOST OF US HAVE NO STOMACH FOR 
GETTING IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC 
BEFORE WE GO PUBLIC.
>> Carley: WHO ARE YOU 
SUPPORTING AND WILL WE HAVE A 
HOUSE SPEAKER BY TOMORROW?
>> I'M SUPPORTING JIM JORDAN, 
YOU ARE FIRST TO KNOW THAT, THEY
DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT.
I THOUGHT HE MADE A STRONGER 
CASE FOR LEADERSHIP.
I THINK THEY WOULD BOTH BE 
AMAZING, BOTH HAVE GREAT 
RELATIONSHIPS.
>> Carley: THEY ARE BOTH 
POPULAR.
>> Todd: NUMBER ONE STORY IF THE
SITUATION IN ISRAEL WAS NO
