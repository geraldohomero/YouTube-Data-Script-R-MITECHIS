ON ALL OF MY PREVIOUS VISITS
HERE AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY
IN BETWEEN, WE HAVE PRESSED
ISRAEL IN CONCRETE WAYS TO
STRENGTHEN CIVILIAN PROTECTION,
TO GET MORE ASSISTANCE TO THOSE
WHO NEED IT.
AND OVER THE PAST FOUR MONTHS,
ISRAEL HAS TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS
TO DO JUST THAT, STARTING THE
FLOW OF AID.
DOUBLING IT DURING THE FIRST
PAUSE FOR HOSTAGE RELEASES,
OPENING THE NORTH AND SOUTH
CORRIDORS IN GAZA SO THAT PEOPLE
COULD MOVE OUT OF IMMEDIATE
HARM'S WAY, THROUGH THESE
CORRIDORS WITH FOUR HOURS PAUSE
EVERY DAY, THREE HOURS NOTICE.
OPENING SHALOM.
STARTING THE FLOW OF ASSISTANCE
FROM JORDAN, ESTABLISHING
DECONFLICTION MECHANISMS FOR
HUMANITARIAN SITES.
AS A RESULT, TODAY MORE
ASSISTANCE THAN EVER IS MOVING
INTO GAZA FROM MORE PLACES THAN
AT ANY TIME SINCE OCTOBER 7th.
AS THE LARGEST DONOR OF
HUMANITARIAN AID TO THE
PALESTINIANS, THE UNITED STATES

ASSISTANCE, INCLUDING FUNDING
90,000 METRIC TONS OF FLOUR,
DELIVERED FROM ASHDOT PORT,
ENOUGH TO PROVIDE BREAD FOR
1.4 MILLION PEOPLE FOR THE NEXT
FIVE MONTHS.
A U.N. TEAM, THE MISSION TO THE
NORTH, TO ASSESS CONDITIONS FOR
THE CIVILIANS WHO ARE STILL
THERE, AS WELL AS WHAT NEEDS TO
BE DONE TO ALLOW DISPLACED
PALESTINIANS TO RETURN BACK HOME
TO THE NORTH.
AND YET, AS I SAID TO THE PRIME
MINISTER AND TO OTHER ISRAELI
OFFICIALS TODAY, THE DAILY TOLL
THAT ITS MILITARY OPERATIONS
CONTINUE TO TAKE ON INNOCENT
CIVILIANS REMAINS TOO HIGH.
IN OUR DISCUSSIONS TODAY, I
HIGHLIGHTED SOME KEY STEPS THAT
ISRAEL SHOULD TAKE TO ENSURE
THAT MORE AID REACHES MORE
PEOPLE IN GAZA.
SO CITIZENS CAN FLOW TO NORTHERN
GAZA WHERE AS I SAID, HUNDREDS
OF THOSE OF PEOPLE ARE
STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE UNDER DIRE
CONDITIONS.
IT SHOULD EXPEDITE THE FLOW OF
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FROM
JORDAN.
IT SHOULD STRENGTHEN
DECONFLICTION, AND IMPROVE
COORDINATION WITH THE
HUMANITARIAN PROVIDERS.
AND ISRAEL MUST ENSURE THAT THE
