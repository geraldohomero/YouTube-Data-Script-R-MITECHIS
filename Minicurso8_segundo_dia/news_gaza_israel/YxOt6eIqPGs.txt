OK
minute Hello John yes forgive me I'm in
A little elegant position here but here
Let's have a massive operation here
Many a massacre operation
We had
to take refuge here in Sanja next to
We were about 5 minutes from the street
from gaza in that direction we can now
Listen to military planes in the
Heaven can also listen to also
the iron dome that is
intercepting several of these rockets
while they were bombing noos and
They were impacting that direction not
so far from here we came to this
location because this was like a bit
The zero zone to say it for
This Matanza operation the militants
Hamas came in a truck
It was the first place in the fact they
they raped and transferred the wall
Border went through this strip
Simply spraying lead for all
parts that were precisely
here holding hands before
We had to bend down stuff
It seems that we can stand now
again where are we forgiveness alone
A very good moment then now
I can show you what happened here
This is where the militaries arrived by
first time and opened fire against
All these vehicles there we see a
baby carriage
There we can see there
Also Clayton at a distance we see
Also bombings would seem to be
What gaza
also shooting or that is the smoke
of rocket launches
Apologize is a bit difficult to see it like this
Being here crouched in Hans here
We can see exactly what happened
But multiple vitimates in this area
They can also see reach
of the damages suffered by these
Many vehicles simply exploded
by the force of ammunition and
shootings they received and now just
are here removing the truck that
brought here the militants of
Hamas there was a bit of resistance
careful
Clayton we see here bullet holes in
The windshield so they stopped
The car had to get out and
They simply started with this shooting and
This I think they took several
Hostages have just gotten out of here
They started taking people
They started to throw them away and the
They took the other side of the border
