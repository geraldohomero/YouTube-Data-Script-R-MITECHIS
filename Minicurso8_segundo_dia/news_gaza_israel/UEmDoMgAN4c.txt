 
LIVING UNDER THE THUMB OF THE 
TALIBAN AND ONE COULD NOT HELP 
BUT BE MOVED. 
CANADA WILL DO RIGHT BY THOSE 
WHO DID RIGHT BY US. 
AND TODAY I'M HERE TO SAY THAT 
WE WILL DO MORE. 
AS THE TALIBAN CONTINUES TO TAKE
OVER MORE OF AFGHANISTAN, MANY 
MORE AFGHAN LIVES ARE NOW UNDER 
INCREASING THREAT AND MANY HAVE 
ALREADY FLED. 
THOSE REFUGEES FACE AN UNCERTAIN
AND VOLATILE FUTURE IN 
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. 
AND CANADA IS HERE TO HELP THEM 
AS WELL. 
IN AN INITIAL EFFORT TO 
ALLEVIATE THE MERGING CRISIS IN 
THE REGION, CANADA WILL BUILD ON
OUR EARLIER SPECIAL IMMIGRATION 
PROGRAMME TO WEBLG OVER 20,000 
VULNERABLE AFGHAN REFUGEES IN 
TOTAL. 
OUR EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON THOSE 
WHO ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE 
INCLUDING WOMEN LEADERS, HUMAN 
RIGHTS DEFENDERS, JOURNALISTS, 
PERSECUTED RELIGIOUS MINORITIES 
AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF PREVIOUSLY
RESETTLED INTERPRETERS. 
THEY WILL COME THROUGH OUR 
FAMILY CLASS SPONSORSHIP 
AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF PREVIOUSLY
RESETTLED INTERPRETERS.
>> I ALSO KNOW THE SIKH 
COMMUNITY HERE IN CANADA LOOKS 
FORWARD TO WELCOMING AFGHAN 
SIKHS AND HINDUS WITH OPEN ARMS 
AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE WILL 
HAVE MORE TO SAY ON THIS 
SPECIFIC SUBJECT. 
THANKS TO THEIR SUPPORT WE HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO RESETTLE A 
NUMBER OF FAMILIES AND A PART OF
THIS UPDATE WE WILL BE 
RESETTLING MORE. 
THIS NEW PROGRAMME WILL WELCOME 
PRIVATELY SPONSORED REFUGEES, 
ALONG WITH THOSE SPONSORED BY 
FAMILY ALREADY. 
SHE HELPED ME EASE SOME OF THE 
BURDEN. 
OFFER REFUGEES A PERMANENT HOME 
IN CANADA. 
WILL COMPLEMENT CANADA'S SPECIAL
IMMIGRATION PROGRAMME THROUGH 
AFTER BAN THES WHO CONTRIBUTED 
TO OUR MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN. 
FOCUSED ON THOSE WHO SUPPORTED 
CANADA'S EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN,
THIS NEW EFFORT WE ARE 
ANNOUNCING TODAY WILL ENCOMPASS 
A PATHWAY. 
WE WILL DRAW ON THE L
