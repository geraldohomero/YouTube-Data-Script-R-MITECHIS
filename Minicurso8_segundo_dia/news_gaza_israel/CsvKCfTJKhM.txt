ALEX HOGAN IS STANDING BY AT ONE
OF THOSE HOSPITALS BUT FIRST 
WE'LL GO TO TREY YENGST.
HE IS JOINING US LIVE AT THAT 
AIR BASE.
HEY, TREY.
>> GOOD MORNING.
REPORTS INDICATE THE 13 HOSTAGES
ARE NOW IN EGYPT.
THEY WERE GREETED BY OFFICERS 
FROM ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE TO 
CONFIRM THEIR IDENTITIES AND 
THEY ARE HEADED TO ISRAEL.
WE'RE TOLD THE RED CROSS 
FACILITATING THAT RELEASE FROM 
HAMAS CUSTODY TO THE RED CROSS 
AND ULTIMATELY TO ISRAEL.
THIS HAS BEEN AN AGONIZING 
NEARLY SEVEN WEEKS FOR THE 
ISRAELI POPULATION.
THE CEASE-FIRE GOING IN EFFECT 
11 HOURS AGO AND APPEARS TO BE 
HOLDING FOR NOW AS THIS PROCESS 
PLAYS OUT FOR THE HOSTAGES.
WE'RE AT THE AIR BASE IN 
SOUTHERN ISRAEL.
THIS IS THE FIRST LOCATION IN 
ISRAEL THE HOSTAGES WILL COME 
TO.
WE AREN'T SURE IF THEY'LL ARRIVE
BY HELICOPTER OR BY BUS.
BUT ONCE HERE, THEY WILL BE 
MEDICALLY EVALUATED, ABLE TO 
MAKE PHONE CALLS WITH LOVED ONES
AND THEN ULTIMATELY THEY'LL BE 
TRANSFERRED TO OTHER MEDICAL 
FACILITIES OR CENTERS ACROSS 
ISRAEL.
THIS HAS BEEN JUST A MOMENT OF 
ANTICIPATION FOR THE ISRAELI 
POPULATION AS THEY WATCH THIS 
PLAY OUT.
THE ISRAELI MILITARY AND 
GOVERNMENT TRYING TO DO 
EVERYTHING THEY CAN FOR THESE 
HOSTAGES.
WE SAW AMBULANCES ARRIVING 
EARLIER TODAY AND SEEN VIDEO OF 
THE NOISE CANCELING HEADPHONES, 
SUNGLASSES, BLANKETS, JUST 
ANYTHING THAT THEY CAN DO TO 
MAKE THESE HOSTAGES COMFORTABLE 
WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 13 PEOPLE 
HERE, WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND 
THEY'RE BEING EXCHANGED FOR 24 
FEMALE PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AND
15 MALE PALESTINIAN TEENAGERS.
AS WE PUSH FORWARD IN THE STORY 
THE BREAK IN THE FIGHTING 
EXPECTED TO LAST FOR FOUR DAYS.
IF IT GOES AS PLANNED COULD SEE 
50 ISRAELI HOSTAGES EXCHANGED IN
EXCHANGE FOR 150 PALESTINIAN 
PRISONERS.
