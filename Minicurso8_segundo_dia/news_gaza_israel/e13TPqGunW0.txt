it was easier to bury our our loved
ones than to go through the anguish that
they're going
through and I can't believe I'm saying
that and each time I go back to
those
moments when you think your whole family
is going to be wiped
out your whole life just goes in front
of you in
seconds people say how come you still
standing on the phone running running
everything I said I say to
them when my mom and my brother are
back I want them to know I've done
everything in my power agriculture
community and ever since it's it's it's
like living in a nightmare and the
pictures keep running in front of my
eyes
um I feel guilty for eating I feel
guilty for sleeping in my own bed I feel
guilty for playing with my children or
covering my children at night 6:30 he
wrote to me they were going inside the
safe room in their
house he wrote so I would tell m him and
how much I miss
him and how much I'm doing everything I
can which is not much but everything I
can to bring them
back is it mine who's coming who's
coming
out so they released two people out of
200 10
20 it's a
game as if to show they're
showing the world how compassionate they
are I know that a ground Invasion can
cause a lot of casualties on both sides
for innocent people
um
so I don't I don't know what is the
right way to do
it and to the
Kamas I don't think we speak the same
language and I'm not meaning about
Arabic but I would tell to them that
those people are not part of this war
and children should not be part of this
war and innocent people should not be
part of this
war the innocent people in Gaza
shouldn't be part of this
war and they should just let all of them
back
home and I have nothing to tell
Kamas absolutely
nothing I mean people who do
this what can you say to
them
