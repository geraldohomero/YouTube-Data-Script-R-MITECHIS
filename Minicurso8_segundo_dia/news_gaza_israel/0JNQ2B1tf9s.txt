china's ambassador to canada told
canadian reporters that allegations of
genocide of the uyghurs are quote
the lies of the century what do you make
of that
we have and will continue to take
very seriously the very credible reports
of human rights abuses uh in uh
in xinjiang in china perpetrated against
the uyghurs by the chinese state
there are significant concerns
being expressed all around the world and
the parliament of canada was very clear
about its concerns
just a few weeks ago we have committed
to work with
our allies internationally on both
getting
clear answers and holding to account
those responsible
with possible consequences that the
world can bring forward
but this is something that is much
better done on a multilateral
basis over the past many years including
a couple of occasions directly to
chinese leadership
we have expressed our deep concern for
the situation
uh facing the uyghurs uh and uh we will
continue to do that
alongside our allies to make sure that
we are actually having an impact
on on what's happening to that community
and just as a follow-up in that same
news conference uh reporters asked the
ambassador whether or not
the case of mong mong zhou and the two
michaels are connected and he said quote
there's no connection
between the cases they're totally
different do you agree with that
no it is obvious that the two michaels
were arrested on trumped-up national
security charges
days after we fulfilled our extradition
treaty responsibilities towards
uh towards our our ally the united
states
uh chinese officials at the time were
very clear that they absolutely
were connected as as a frame and nothing
the ambassador can say now will will
dissuade me from
understanding that that is indeed the
case
