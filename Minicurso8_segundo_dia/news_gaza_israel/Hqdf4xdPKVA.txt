I'm deeply saddened and outrage by the
uh explosion at the hospital in Caza
yesterday and based on what I've seen
and appear appears as though it was done
by the other team not not you but
there's a lot of people out there I'm
not sure so we got a lot got to overcome
a lot of things also bear in mind that
AAS does not represent all the
Palestinian
people and has brought them only
suffering that atrocities that
uh make Isis look somewhat more rational
this would be equivalent to over 50,000
Americans murdered in a single day
that's
2911 that is why October 7th is another
day that will live
in this to be here
today for simple reason I want people of
Israel people of the
world with the United States stands
I've had my great secretary of state
here he's been here for a lot but I
wanted to personally come and make that
clear terrorist group of M has
slaughtered has been pointed out over
1,300 people and is not hyperbole she
just slaughtered
slaughtered and U including 31
American and they've taken scores of
people hostage including children you
said imagine what those children hiding
from theas we thinking it's beyond my
comprehension comprehension Hamas
murdered children in front of their
parents and parents in front of their
children they burned people alive they
raped and murdered women they beheaded
soldiers they they
search for the secret hiding places
where parents hid their children and
just imagine Mr President the fear and
the Panic of those little children in
their last
moments as the monsters discovered found
out their hiding places Kamas kidnapped
women children elderly Holocaust
survival I know you share our outr on
this and I know you share our
determination to bring these people
back
