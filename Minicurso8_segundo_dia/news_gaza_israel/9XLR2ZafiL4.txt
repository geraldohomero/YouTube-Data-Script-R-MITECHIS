>>> U. S. SECRETARY OF STATE 
ANTONY BLINKEN HAS BEEN 
SPEAKING IN DAVOS THIS MORNING 
ON A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES, 
INCLUDING WARS IN UKRAINE AND 
GAZA AND RELATIONS WITH CHINA. 
ON THE CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST, THE SECRETARY CALLED THE 
SITUATION WITH GAZA 
GUTWRENCHING. 
>> FOR ME AND I THINK FOR SO 
MANY OF US, WHAT WE ARE SEEING 
EVERY SINGLE DAY IN GAZA, IS 
GUTWRENCHING. 
THE SUFFERING WE ARE SEEING 
AMONG INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN BREAKS MY HEART. 
>> SO JOINING ME NOW WITH MORE 
ON THE ON SECRETARY BLINKEN'S 
COMMENTS AND HIS VISIT TO DAVOS 
IS CBS REPORTER CHRISTINA 
RUFFINI. 
CHRISTINA, EVERYBODY CAN 
UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT. 
IT IS GUTWRENCHING. 
DID THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAY 
ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE 
SITUATION IN GAZA, EITHER HOW 
TO BRING SOME RESOLUTION OR 
WHAT POST CONFLICT SHOULD LOOK 
LIKE? 
>> THERE ARE DECISIONS ABOUT 
WHAT GAZA SHOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN 
THE SITUATION ENDS. 
WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF HUMAN 
TRAGEDY FOR ISRAELIS AND 
PALESTINIANS. 
HE TALKED ABOUT A PALESTINIAN 
STATE, SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING NO MATTER WHERE THIS 
GOES AT THE END OF IT, THE 
ARGUMENT U. S. HAS BEEN TRYING 
TO MAKE AN BLINKEN HAS BEEN 
MAKING IN DAVOS AND ELSEWHERE, 
IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR ISRAELI 
SECURITY  GOING FORWARD TO HAVE 
A PALESTINIAN STATE. 
THEY HAVE NOT SO WHAT THAT 
LOOKS LIKE, WHERE THE MANPOWER 
AND ALL WILL COME FOR THAT BUT 
THE U. S. IS MAKING, AT THIS 
POINT, THE THESE KINDS OF 
COMPLEX WILL ONLY CONTINUE 
UNLESS PALESTINIANS FEEL THEY 
HAVE AUTONOMY AND CONTROL OVER 
THEIR OWN FUTURES. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THE U. S. IS 
REALLY PUSHING FOR, NOT ONLY IN 
THE REGIONAL ARENA BUT ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE. 
THAT IS THE MESSAGE BLINKEN 
BROUGHT TO DAVOS. 
>> HE ALSO SAID SOMETHING I DID 
NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND. 
HE SAID IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR REGIONALIZATION IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST. 
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?  
>> Reporter: THAT GOES BACK TO 
THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. 
WE HAVE THESE ABRAHAM ACCORDS, 
WHICH WAS NORMALIZATION BETWEEN 
ISRAEL AND THE GULF NEIGHBORS. 
SAUDI ARABIA WAS SET TO BE 
NEXT. 
THERE ARE NOT OFFICIAL 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN 
THE TWO, THAT IS A LONG-
STANDING ISSUE. 
THEY WERE INCHING THAT WAY AS 
THE CONFLICT ERUPTED. 
THAT TAKES A STEP BACK. 
THE OTHER ARGUMENT BLINKEN IS 
MAKING IS THAT ISRAEL
