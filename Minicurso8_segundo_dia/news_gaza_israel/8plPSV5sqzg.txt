after raising doubts over the country's
electronic voting system the brazilian
president gile boston arrow says that he
sees only three options materializing
for him in the 2022 presidential
election re-election death or prison
he made the remarks at a meeting of the
evangelical leaders
adding in typical bolsonaro bravado the
prison option was out of question i'm
quoting further no man on earth will
threaten me quote unquote
his comments following his questioning
of the country's electronic voting
system one that was widely praised for
helping eliminate fraud and accelerating
election results since it was
implemented in 1996 and as for official
data about 147 million voters across
5567 municipalities made use of more
than 400 000 voting machines to cast
their ballots in last year's municipal
polls
a sign of the popularity of the
electronic voting system in brussels
the run-up to the presidential election
has been marred by a host of issues to
name a few
the president's apathy when it comes to
addressing the covert 19 crisis that
claimed the lives of more than half a
million brazilians
his disregard of the mask mandates and
other safety measures during the
pandemic
disseminating misinformation on the
covert 19 vaccines and the
administration's unwillingness to
implement proper strategies to tackle
the issue of climate change all of this
led to a significant hike in bolsonaro's
disapproval ratings
as per polls the right-wing populist
leader is trailing left-wing former
president luis inacio lula da silva
and if that wasn't enough in the latest
president boston arrow has backed a
rollback of indigenous rights saying
that they are a block on agricultural
expansion
and this has sparked unrest and protests
on friday 150 indigenous people
protested in front of his presidential
palace ahead of the key supreme court
ruling on their ancestral lands
that being said the far-right president
remains incorrigible bolsonaro also
invited the evangelical leaders to show
up at the planned seventh september
nationwide marches to support him
