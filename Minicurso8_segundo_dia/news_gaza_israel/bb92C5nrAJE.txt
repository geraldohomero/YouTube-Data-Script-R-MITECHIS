Of course what you have to separate ac√≠ is
very important is the
radicalization that some groups have
Islamist and Islam terrorists
As religion it is
say the use of the
use of a religion
brought to the extreme to
radicalization to fanaticism is what
is if you want in doubt at the level
worldwide that is what is due
condemn not say Islam not so
Judaism not Catholicism
problem is that there is clearly in ever
There are in Hezbollah there are practices
Extremely taken to a government
theocratic that only allows
live under the extreme rules of El
Islamism that is, if you are not a woman
You go out and don't get dressed
in black because it is not in covered target
covered with the veil you go against the rules
They kill you then with everything
that means not all that that

To know worldwide this must
say in the world one thing
It is those who profess religion
