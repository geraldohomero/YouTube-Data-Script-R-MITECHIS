as the war on Gaza continues South
Africans have held dozens of protests
prayer meetings and pickets some in
support of Israel others like this one
in Cape Town calling for a ceasefire and
end to the
genocide however the protest quickly
descended into chaos as police fired
water cannon and stun grenades some
blame tensions between opposing groups

they could have uh de-escalated
the situation uh much more
professionally even if there was
agitation on both sides and we say and
there was and which there was and we say
even the even the law enforcement uh
only added to escalate the
situation while South Africa's
government supports a two-state solution

awareness as much as we can um with the
genocide that is taking place um

lives opposition party the economic
