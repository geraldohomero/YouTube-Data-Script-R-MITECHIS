THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
WE WANT TO GIVE THE FINAL WORD
WHO EXPERIENCED ANTI-SEMITISM
AT ITS WORST, THE HOLOCAUST.
6 MILLION JEWS SYSTEMATICALLY
MURDERED WITH WORLD WAR II.
FOR THE SURVIVORS, THE TEAR AND
PAIN IS ALIVE TODAY.
NEW FEARS THAT THE HATE THEY
SAW LOAN SO LONG AGO NEVER WENT
AWAY.
>> I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS
ME.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I SURVIVED.
I WAS A KID.
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING
ON.
>> 6 MILLION JEWS WERE KILLED
IN THE HOLOCAUST.
YOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE DENY THAT,
IT NEVER HAPPENED, IT IS NOT
TRUE.
I KNOW IT HAPPENED.
>> WATCHING TELEVISION WHAT IS
GOING ON, MY GOD, SAYING THINGS
LIKE HITLER.
'S BEEN A WARNING FOR THE NEW
GENERATION COMING OUT, IT IS A
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE THING, WE
ARE JEWISH AND HAVE TO HIDE
OURSELVES.
SPENT ALL IT TAKES IS A SPARK,
CANCER IN SOCIETY AND NOW I CAN
SEE IT HAPPENING AGAIN.
I'M WORRIED FOR MY CHILDREN AND
GRANDCHILDREN.
THEY DON'T DESERVE IT.
>> WE HAVE ANTI-SEMITISM ALL
THE TIME.
>> WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND NOT
EDUCATED YET, YOU CAN FOLLOW
THE OTHERS.
IF YOU FOLLOW A MOB, A MOB HAS
ITS OWN MIND AND
CHARACTERISTIC, YOU LOSE YOUR
OWN.
>> PEOPLE DON'T FEEL SAFE
WALKING IN THE STREET, IT IS
NOT THE AMERICA I USED TO KNOW.
>> IT WILL DESTROY YOU INSIDE
AND OUT.
THEY HAVE TO START WITH THE
GOOD IN PEOPLE.
>> I AM CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.
I HOPE AMERICA WILL DEAL WITH IT
AND THE TURNAROUND WILL COME
REAL SOON SO MY CHILDREN,
GRANDCHILDREN, AND GREAT GRAND
CHILDREN CAN LIVE IN PEACE.
SPENT THE JEWISH PEOPLE ALWAYS
HAVE HOPE, OKAY, BECAUSE WE
FEEL WE BELONG, WE HAVE A
PURPOSE.
NUMBER THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS
WHAT IS GOING ON.
I THINK NOW IS DIFFERENT.
I LIKE TO RECALL THE PHRASE,
NEVER AGAIN WHICH IS NOW.
EVEN IF THINGS APPEN TO US, AT
LEAST WE DID NOT GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.
>> YOU CAN NEVER FORGET, OKAY,
NEVER FORGET.
IF YOU FORGET, DOOMED TO HAPPEN
