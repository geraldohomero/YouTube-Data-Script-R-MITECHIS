And we find our envoy in Jerusalem
special Ludovic de Fouco hello to you
Ludovic The death of these 24 soldiers is
experienced as a shock we understood it in
Israeli society but also in
the political class Prime Minister
Netaniiaou evokes a disaster
Yes indeed and here on Mount
Herzel in the military cemetery where the
ceremonies follow one another
can imagine that the climate is
particularly heavy and weighing everything
The hour is a 35 -year -old man who has
been put in the lead
He was the father of four children our
team was able to talk to a woman
who grew up with him that he knew
well had and she said that she had had
harm to achieve what was going on that
Figures were really terrifying 21
reservists killed in one day this
which made the total assessment of the
dead in the ranks of the army
Israeli since the start of
Tustin's terrestrial operation now
219 But she said we must continue the
war because it is the only way
For us for the Israelis of
continue to live here in Israel and it is
a reaction that echoes that of
Prime Minister himself Benjamin
Netaniaahou who reacted to the death of her
soldiers saying that he associated his sentence
to that of families but by moving
no line which is however more
in addition questioning within the
Israeli society in opinion
but also within the class
policy within his cabinet
war his military strategy and which is
to say uh that's what he said
Prime Minister regarding the death of
his soldiers and for the very survival of
Israelis we must continue to us
Beat I quote it until victory
total and it is this strategy until
bouhist until the total victory that
a question
Minister of War from
the opposition within the cabinet of
war Gal Eisencott said himself
that it was illusory to think that there
would have a complete absolute victory
total against Hamas and what to claim
This was somewhere to lie to
Opinion The declarations of the first
minister who echoes that of his
Minister of National Security Son
ally of the extreme right Itamard
Bengvir who said it was necessary
now crush the enemy in Gaza to
I quote him to pay tribute to the will
fell Israeli soldiers they have
Writing with their blood thank you very much
Ludovicque de Fouco Special Envoy
France 24 in Jerusalem
