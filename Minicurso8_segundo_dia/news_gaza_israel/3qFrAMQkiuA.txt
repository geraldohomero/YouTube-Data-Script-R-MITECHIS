[Applause]
Smiling these Gazatí decorate their store
With the media at hand
determined to celebrate Ramadan as
every year despite
Context the Ramadan is very different
This year we are not at home we are low
campaign stores but really
We wanted to decorate and celebrate and pray
To be back at home
before Ramadan ends a
Ramadan very special because
Prayers must be performed outside
Most of the mosques in the enclave
Palestine have been destroyed and many
Gazatí will not be able to break the fast for
lack of
Food today we can barely get
water then what will be during the
Ramadán I swear that they have passed CCO
months that we do not see a single egg or a
single meat the sweets are barely
arriving in the old city of
Jerusalem The atmosphere is lju the streets
They will not be decorated this year as a signal
of solidarity with the inhabitants of
Gaza in our dear Gaza we see
Family genocide destruction
War and we the people of Jerusalem
We feel this
pain so we decided not to decorate the
old city this year out of respect for
Blood of us the children of our
older of our
Martyrs a romadan overshadowed by the
War for many Muslims throughout the
world and under the sign of inflation
Like here in Tunes
Ramadan is a month of blessings but
We are seeing even higher prices
things are exorbitantly expensive and
poorer cannot even satisfy
your basic needs in Egypt
Government decided to subsidize
certain star products of
holidays a welcome impulse to
customers of this market in
Guisa the price of dates oscillates
Between 20 and 70 Egyptian pounds
kilo is very affordable for
All the month of festivities will end
with the Lad Fitter around 9 of
April
