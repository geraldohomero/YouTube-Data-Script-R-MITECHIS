The legacy of still alive today is celebrated
A Mass in honor of the reporter
American Palestine murdered
A year when he covered a raid of the
Israeli army in family yin and
Friends continue to claim that their death
It is not unpunished
This last year was very difficult for
We especially knowing that no
Justice has been done that unique bullet
that killed her left us with pain and agony
Wishing everything was a bad dream
I feel as if it were the first day is
very hard but we will continue because
That is Shein's message
Christian Women Journalist
SHIRIM claims its sobrinalina
supported by witnesses and investigations of
media and the UN fault of the crime to a
Israel's Israel Sniper
admitted the responsibility of a soldier
as high probability refuses
initiate a judicial case which forced
To the family to resort to the criminal court
International
We are still waiting for a response from
prosecutor with the hope that he will take this
case since it constitutes a crime of
War under international law
We want the soldier to be done
responsible and also the person who
ordered to tighten the trigger to give up
translates into actions and that is what still
we have not seen
This is what the union demands
Palestinian journalists
Its president explains that Shirin is a
of the 55 dead reporters from the
Year 2000 and denounces that only in 2022
There were 902 aggressions against the press
every journalist who wants to convey the
Truth is the object of attacks and crimes
We suffer twice for the
murders and crimes and for the
silence of the international community
For the Palestinians who dedicate
graffiti monuments and even a street in
Ramala thus keep the memory of the
Palestine voice
