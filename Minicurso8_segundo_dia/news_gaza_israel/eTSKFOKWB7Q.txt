we put a few messages out on social
media just suggesting that we were going
and i emphasized suggesting that we were
going to try and get some aid over
within probably 24 hours we ended up
with four and a half to five ton
of goods so what did you do you just hop
in in a van and drive here like
yes the simple answer is yes we knew the
reality of it isn't that bad to get in
our vehicles
we haven't used anything clever vehicle
wise they are our own personal builders
vans from our day-to-day jobs
downstairs
we did it because we just felt we could
do a little bit of good
in the bigger picture
a lot of what we have bought is
the some of the the tinned foods
and
tomato soups and baked beans from the uk
we've also bought
some of the bedding supplies the
blankets very importantly
supplies for the babies and the very
younger generation and that was a good
part of it one of the biggest things
that we dropped here was the medical aid
which were boxes of
surgical bandages um
boxes of
painkillers um
[Music]
surgical gloves and and the likes that
have literally gone to the front line we
keep hearing people say send money don't
send goods and yet here you have two
huge vans filled with food and donations
and medical supplies why because
the people who donated friends family
and strangers obviously
they wanted to know that the aid that
was given
was going to the destination that it was
required for people who think that
this is irresponsible of you what do you
say to people who would think that
from from that point of view we all
discussed it before we even left england
and that was that we would go and do
what we could
the moment we thought we were being a
hindrance to any part of the system
we would return
every little bit helps
