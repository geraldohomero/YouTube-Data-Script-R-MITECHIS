it's been over 31 days of waking
nightmare for abahi Broach 31 days since
he last spoke to his wife or saw his
three young children aged 10 8 and 4
years old 31 days since the October 7th
attacks by Hamas on Israel which
kidnapped and took his family hostage
it's been so long I'm starting
to lose it I don't know in what
situation they are in healthwise or you
know they're being fed taken care
of I can only hope that everything is
all
right bro's family was taken from one of
the hardest hit communities kafar Aza
they were hiding in a safe room with
their neighbors's daughter whose parents
were killed he had gone outside to see
if he could help stop the gunman but
they got separated at first he thought
everyone but his dog was killed before
he received confirmation they were taken
he started camp camping with his dog
outside the Israeli defense Ministry
with a sign to remind the military my
family is in Gaza others have joined him
in what's become a daily occurrence all
day this is what I'm
doing I talk to people and uh I tell
them my
story and my beliefs and uh I just keep
on going you know and
I night time comes and I just fall
asleep you know
i' maybe I don't fall apart but I just
fall asleep you know from all this and
get so tired so I just wanted them to
see you know the decision makers to know
that I'm there and my
family uh is held hostage so whenever
they make their big
decisions they think about me and I
think they are thinking about me right
now
uh they can't ignore me after a month
broich is tired of protesting but he
says View views of the war are changing
I think it has changed uh a lot you know
people uh did change their views on this
uh
conflict uh everybody just wanted
Vengeance at
first
uh I don't think
uh no they wanted
retaliation which is human I guess but
uh I hope it ends you know
just a cycle that keeps going on and
on uh and know I'm a part of it and my
kids and wife are a part of
it they shouldn't
be
