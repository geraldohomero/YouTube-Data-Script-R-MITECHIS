it was a day full of symbolism as US
President Donald Trump touched down at
Tel Aviv Airport for a crash course in
Israeli Palestinian politics
his next stop was Jerusalem's Old City
first to the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre where Christians believe Jesus
was crucified and then to the Western
Wall the holiest site where Jews pray
his family was with him Trump's advisors
earlier rejected and offered by the
Israeli government the Netanyahu to
accompany him to the wall keeping easy
Israeli hosts in mind President Trump
criticized the Iran nuclear deal
Israel regards Iran as a mortal threat
most importantly the United States and
Israel can declare with one voice that
Iran must never be allowed to possess a
nuclear weapon never ever and
must cease its deadly funding training
and equipping of
terrorists and malicious and a must
cease immediately moment as a team we
are waiting for this US government to
become stable intellectually and in
terms of its stances and its future
plans I hope it can settle down so that
we can more accurately pass judgments on
their leaders in Washington US president
Donald Trump has said he wants to end
the israeli-palestinian conflict by
striking the ultimate deal but all the
efforts by experienced negotiators and
US presidents have failed and every year
the occupation of Palestinian land
becomes more permanent than the chance
for peace more remote on Tuesday morning
the focus shifts to Bethlehem in the
occupied West Bank Trump will meet
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas
so far there's been no sign of any fresh
ideas Trump has to restart talks until
then it's another tour by another
president and few people expect a
breakthrough Nicole Johnston TRT world
