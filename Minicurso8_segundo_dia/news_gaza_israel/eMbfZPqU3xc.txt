hello everyone
25 years ago canada was among the 189
countries that endorsed the beijing
declaration
and platform for action this platform
outlined a vision of a world in which
women
have the same rights and opportunities
as men
my friends we're not there yet and the
harsh reality is that the covet 19
pandemic
threatens the progress we have made in
fact
it's exacerbating inequalities worldwide
women have experienced greater job
losses and have disproportionately
shouldered the burden of unpaid care
work
at home and the effects on the world's
most vulnerable women and girls
are devastating now is the time to
double down on our efforts
to achieve gender equality and to chart
our next
steps so rather than putting gender
equality on the back
burner let's put an intersectional
feminist lens on all of our responses
and recovery efforts
up front
each and every one of us have to do
their part to ensure
that women in all of the diversities are
at the heart of
decision making and it's because we know
it provides us with better and more
inclusive results
throughout the world we also know that
when women's organizations
are given support and flexibility
they can palpably change their
communities
during the pandemic we have seen women's
organizations
rapidly mobilize and change the
situation
they have provided solutions adapted to
such
challenges as gender-based violence the
access
to crucial information about public
health
if we support such organizations if we
widen the leadership of women and girls
not only will we be able to achieve
gender parity
but we will also be able to build a
world which is more prosperous
more inclusive and more peaceful
although we're commemorating the 25th
anniversary of the beijing platform
differently than we may have expected
canada
will continue to push this agenda
forward and we're proud to be co-leading
the feminist movements
and leadership action coalition as part
of the beijing plus 25 agenda
this year was always going to be
important for women and for our
collective work
towards achieving irreversible progress
on gender equality
well despite the setbacks of covet 19 it
still
can be this is our moment to be
accountable
to be ambitious and to work together to
build a better
fairer future for everyone
