plenty of food in the markets but for
khadija nawaza there's no way to afford
it
sometimes we wake up and don't know what
we can make for the children like
thousands of palestinians her world food
program card has been deactivated
she says she usually makes her children
eggs for breakfast but without the aid
she can't afford to buy food anymore the
u.n agency's budget has been cut
drastically due in large part to the
loss of hundreds of millions of dollars
in aid from the u.s
the impact on palestinian families is
massive in the west bank 27 000
palestinians have lost all food
assistance in the gaza strip 165
000 residents have seen their aid cut by
20 percent
this decision is extremely difficult to
make the people that we do reach are the
most vulnerable across palestine and we
appreciate that we're going to put
further anxiety in these families we're
going to make them more desperate
a 2018 u.n report says two-thirds of
palestinians don't have enough to eat
it's a problem fueled by weak economic
growth and high unemployment under the
israeli blockade of the gaza strip and
occupation of the west bank
abdal has a sick son but neither he nor
his three grown sons can earn money to
support him
we're unemployed so how is it going to
be enough it's not enough at all it's
not enough if they cut more i'll start
begging in the street
the un and palestinian authority are
appealing to the international community
to make up for the u.s aid cuts
they're asking for 350 million
they say much more is needed but they're
not sure they'll get it
until they do thousands of families in
gaza and the occupied west bank are
thinking of what to feed their children
they drank milk and eight eggs and in
the evening my wife cooked lentils for
the children during the winter but we've
not had the money to do that in a while
as these diplomatic disputes play out
it's not the politicians who pay the
price
