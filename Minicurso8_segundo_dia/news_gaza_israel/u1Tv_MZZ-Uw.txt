Maintained and Yemen's hurdles again and again
From western countries and Israel in areas
Missile rockets and drones on connected ships

Let me tell you that I am in the Red Sea
Shipping of the world due to these attacks
Business variable has been dead due to which goods
Capital companies to their ships
Has to be sent through a long way
This route goes via South Africa
Which is very expensive but now
Has announced that the new route cape of good
Even on the way of Hope
Will target ships and so
Israel Hamas War is in danger of increasing the scope of war
America is hovering
War should not spread throughout the middle East
Although America and Britain in Yemen
Many airstrikes were also carried out on Hati's locations
Were but because of that in the strength of Huki
There is no shortage but he more aggressive
Has started attacking in ways
