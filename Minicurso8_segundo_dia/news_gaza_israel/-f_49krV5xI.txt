Iranian attack on Israel on Saturday 15
April 2024 at night looks very
organized but seems designed
to minimize the number of casualties
The Israeli military said 99% of projectiles
which was fired by Iran was intercepted by the system
Israeli air defense along with
allies and only a small number of missiles

Based on CNN's investigation
International Iranian attack on Israel
judged to have been designed to fail
The attack carried out by Iran only
considered the first reason because
Iran chose to attack alone rather than
Through its pro -its proxy in Lebanon
or Syria or with the word voting
The path that is further away is around 1600
Km between Iran and Israel gives
time for Israel to prepare
defense of the coming attack
so that the element of the surprise of the attack becomes
reduced and the impact of damage is also not
Large Iran launched a drone from
the area is about 16600 km away from
Israel this can be said to be surgery
it is nothing more than
scary fireworks show
In other words the Iranian attack was only
Iran's bluff also insisted it would not
continue the attack if Israel does not
replied because for Iran the attack on
Israel on April 13, 2024 at night only

Iran feels encouraged to attack
Israel in order to reiterate its position
as a regional power and
eliminate the assumption that Iran
Just a paper tiger
