FOREIGN AID BILL,
JENNIFER GRIFFIN REPORTING ON
THE U.S. RESPONSE TO THE COUNTER
ATTACK BUT FIRST JEFF PAUL IS
LIVE ON THE GROUND IN TEL AVIV.
JEFF, ANY WORD FROM ISRAEL'S WAR
CABINET ON THIS?
>> WE ARE EXPECTING THEM TO MEET
TODAY IF THEY HAVE NOT ALREADY.
OBVIOUSLY THE TOPIC OF
DISCUSSION WOULD BE THE STRIKE
ON IRAN.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT SO
FAR ON THE RECORD THERE HAVE
BEEN NO COMMENTS MADE BY ANYONE
WITHIN THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT OR
WITHIN THE ISRAELI MILITARY.
THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE WHEN IT
COMES TO THESE VERY TARGETED
MISSIONS, IT'S VERY RARE FOR THE
ISRAELI MILITARY OR GOVERNMENT
TO GO ON THE RECORD AND TALK
ABOUT THEM OR CONFIRM THEM, BUT
THE STRIKE ALONE DOES GIVE A
MESSAGE AND NAMELY SENDS THE
MESSAGE TO IRAN THAT ISRAEL CAN
HIT WITHIN ITS BORDERS PRETTY
MUCH ANY TIME IT WANTS.
ANYWHERE IT WANTS.
IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS OF
THIS TARGETED STRIKE IT'S
ROUGHLY 200 MILES AWAY FROM THE
CAPITAL CITY OF TEHRAN AND
ISFAHAN AND NEAR THE NUCLEAR
FACILITY.
IT DID SEEM TO TARGET A NEARBY
MILITARY BASE IT DID NOT HIT.
IT HAS MOSTLY DOWNPLAYED THE
STRIKE THEY HAVE REPORTED THERE
WERE EXPLOSIONS AND THE
EXPLOSIONS WERE FROM THE IRANIAN
AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM RESPONDING TO
THREE DRONES, THOSE ARE THEIR
WORDS BUT MADE NO MENTION OF A
SOURCE OF THE ATTACK.
AN IRANIAN OFFICIAL HAS
REPORTEDLY TOLD WRITERS IT HAS
NO PLANS TO STRIKE BACK
IMMEDIATELY BUT LISTEN TO WHAT
THE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD TO SAY
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT ISRAEL
DURING AN INTERVIEW JUST A FEW
HOURS BEFORE THAT IS REALLY IN
IRAN.
>> WHAT WILL OUR MAXIMUM
RESPONSE BE?
I CAN ONLY SAY IT WILL BE
CARRIED OUT AT A MAXIMUM LEVEL
AND IT WILL BE REGRETFUL FOR
THEM.
THE DETAILS HAVE BEEN PLANNED BY
THE ARMED FORCES OF MY COUNTRY.
>> WE HAVE NOT HEARD MUCH FROM
ISRAEL TODAY.
A LITTLE WHILE AGO
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU POSTED THIS
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
IT'S HARD TO SEE WITH THE
GRAPHICS COVERING IT BUT THAT IS
A PICTURE OF BENJAMIN NETANYAHU
SITTING AT HIS DESK AND RIGHT
BELOW HIS HANDS THERE ARE SOME
DOCUMENTS RIGHT THERE THAT ARE
BLURRED OUT AND HE TITLED IT
BASICALLY WITH A VERY CRYPTIC
MESSAGE "SHABBAT SHALOM]
" HERE IN
TEL AVIV THINGS HAVE SEEMED VERY
NORMAL TODAY.
WE SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE
BEACH AND EXERCISING DOING THEIR
SHOPPING AHEAD OF SHAB
