Stéphane who is online again
With us Stéphane Amar Hello we come
to see in pictures what the
Palestinians of the Gaza Strip
Since the Hebrew state has directly
pointed out several members of
Longi What are the consequences
of this
case the consequences are absolutely
considerable because it is necessary
understand that onei since 1948 and
well it is an essenel component
of the Palestinian cause and life
Simply in the territories
occupied in particular in Gaza where it is estimated
that between 70 and 80 % of the population
depend on
help him
the king are schools it's like we
sees it on these images of the
food distribution not just
During the wars but on a daily basis and
If the Roit were to collapse and well
It would be a whole structure of the
Palestinian society which collapsed
For several years now
The Israelis denounce a rit we
remember that in 2018 they had managed to
convince Donald Trump to stop his
funding we criticize in particular in
Israel to the king to allow a
teaching very hostile to Israel see
downright anti -Semitic in the schools of

status of eternal refugee a status which is
Transmet from generation to generation

to speak probably the most virulating
the one that has the most impact since
many countries have this time
joined to this call to cease the
funding of which France which has
suspended the payment of this month but
obviously and as the
President Mbarak It is obvious that
sorry President Sissi it is obvious
that this and well would lead to very
very heavy consequences in the band
of Gaza but also in Jordan and
I would also say where he rides
that is to say also in Jordan in
Syria and Lebanon
