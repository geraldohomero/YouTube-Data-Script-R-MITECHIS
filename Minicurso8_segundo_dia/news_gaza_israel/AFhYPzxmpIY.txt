>> Bill: MARK ESPER WILL WEIGH 
IN ON THAT.
WE BEGIN IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL 
WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS 
HEADLINES FROM OVERNIGHT.
TREY, LET'S START THERE.
HELLO.
>> GOOD MORNING.
A LOT OF UPDATES OVERNIGHT.
WE'LL START WITH THE AL-SHIFA 
HOSPITAL WHERE ISRAELI FORCES 
CONDUCTED AN EARLY-MORNING RAID 
TARGETING WHAT THEY SAY ARE 
TUNNEL ENTRANCES FOR HAMAS, THE 
GROUP IN CONTROL OF GAZA.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE 
PLAY-BY-PLAY OF HOW IT ALL 
UNFOLDED AND HOW WE FOUND OUT.
LATE LAST NIGHT I RECEIVED A 
TEXT MESSAGE FROM A SENIOR HAMAS
OFFICIAL INSIDE GAZA SAYING IN A
FEW MINUTES THE HOSPITAL WILL BE
STORMED.
WE THEN REACHED OUT TO THE 
ISRAELI MILITARY.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION
BUT ULTIMATELY RELEASED A 
STATEMENT SAYING THEY ARE 
STORMING AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL, 
GAZA'S LARGEST MEDICAL FACILITY 
TO GO AFTER HAMAS MILITANTS.
WE HAVE GATHERED MORE 
INFORMATION THIS MORNING FROM 
TOP INTELLIGENCE AND DEFENSE 
OFFICIALS IN ISRAEL TRYING TO 
GET AN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE 
FOCUS AND EFFORTS WERE FOR THE 
ISRAELIS.
YOU CAN SEE IN SOME VIDEO HERE 
ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES FOR 
ISRAELI FORCES WAS TO DELIVER 
MEDICAL AID TO PALESTINIAN 
CIVILIANS, AROUND 600 PATIENTS 
AT THE HOSPITAL AND 1200 
INTERNALLY DISPLACED 
PALESTINIANS SHELTERING IN PLACE
THERE.
THE ISRAELIS DELIVERED AID TO 
THOSE PALESTINIANS AND THEY ALSO
WENT AFTER HAMAS MILITANTS.
THEY SAY THEY KILLED FOUR 
MILITANTS AROUND THE HOSPITAL 
GATE BEFORE ENTERING THE 
FACILITY.
ONCE INSIDE, NO BULLETS WERE 
FIRED.
THIS IS OF NOTE BECAUSE IT 
INDICATES HAMAS FIGHTERS AND 
LEADERSHIP USED THE TUNNEL 
NETWORK TO GET TO THE SOUTHERN 
PART OF GAZA KNOWING THE 
ISRAELIS WERE GOING TO RAID THE 
FACILITY.
ALL OF THIS IS TAKING PLACE AMID
GROUND FIGHTING INSIDE GAZA.
ISRAELIS SAY THEY TOOK OVER THE 
CAMP IN THE NORTHERN PART OF 
GAZA A HAMAS STRONGHOLD.
WE GO TO THE SOUTH OF GAZA WITH 
THE HALF YEAH CROSSING, THE 
BORDER BETWEEN EGYPT AND GAZA.
A FUEL TRUCK PASSED INTO GAZA.
THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS TAKING 
PLACE BEHIND THE SCENES NOT ONLY
TO TRY TO DIPLOMATICALLY GET 
SOME OF THE HOSTAGES FREED BUT 
MORE AID INTO GAZA.
>> Bill: THANK YOU, IN 20 
MINUTES WE'LL TALK TO A MEMBER 
OF T
