CONFIRMING THAT IT IS MOVING
U.S. MILITARY ASSETS CLOSER TO
ISRAEL.
THE CORRESPONDENT COURTNEY KUBE
GIVES US INFORMATION.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE SPORT
IN THE REGION, HOW LARGE MIGHT
IT BE?
HOW CLOSE IS IT TO ISRAEL.
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANT MESSAGE
IT SENDS.
>> SO, IT'S BOTH A BIG PRESENCE
AND IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT
CAPABILITY THAT THE U.S. IS
PROVIDING.
STARTING AT SEA, THEY WILL SEND
IT.
IT'S ALREADY ON ITS WAY THERE.
THE USS GERALD R FOR CURATOR
STRIKES GROUPS THAT'S THE AREA
CALF CAREER AND IT'S A MISSILE
GUIDED CRUISER.
AND FOR MISSILE GUIDED
DESTROYERS.
THOSE HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIRE
OFF MISSILES AND THEY HAVE
TORPEDOES.
THOSE ARE NOT ONLY THE KINDS OF
MISSILES THAT CAN HIT A TARGET
ON LAND BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THE
ABILITY TO DO MISSILE DEFENSE.
LET'S SAY THERE'S A MISSILE
COMING IN.
THEY HAVE ONES THEY CAN GO UP
AND INTERCEPT.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, TO THE
CARRIER AND SOME OF THE SHIPS,
THEY HAVE FIXED WING AIRCRAFTS.
THEY HAVE HELICOPTERS.
THEY HAVE SURVEILLANCE.
6000 SAILORS.
HUGE CAPABILITY AT.
SEE THIS IS LARGELY A SHOW OF
PRESENTS OR FORCE OR SUPPORT
FOR ISRAEL AT SEA.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE U.S.
HAS ALSO SENT A NUMBER OF
AIRCRAFTS.
WE ARE TOLD-ING SOMEONE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD OF 25 ADDITIONAL
AIRCRAFT GOING INTO THE REGION.
THOSE INCLUDE 15 F-16S AND A
TENS ALL ATTACKED FIGHTER
AIRCRAFT.
IT'S ADDITION TO THE F-18S IN
THE EASTERN MAD.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE U.S.
IS SENDING 35.
WHY THAT'S SO IMPORTANT, IT'S
NOT ONLY AN ATTACK, AIRCRAFT IT
HAS INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE
CAPABILITIES, VERY EXTENSIVE
CAPABILITIES.
AND ALSO HAS ELECTRONIC WARFARE
ABILITIES.
THAT INCLUDES BEING ABLE TO
JAM.
THIS IS A HUGE SWEEP OF ASSETS
THAT THE U.S. IS SENDING TO THE
REGION.
IT PROVIDES NOT ONLY TO
POTENTIAL DETERRENCE TO HAMAS
AND OTHER GROUPS WHO MIGHT BE
SUPPORTING HAMAS FROM
CONTINUING THESE ATTACKS,
FURTHERING THEIR TAX, IT
PROVIDES A REAL ABILITY TO
RESPOND IF NECESSARY.
AGAIN, I WANT TO STRESS HERE,
AT THIS POINT, THE U.S.
OFFICIALS ON TALKING TO ARE NOT
TALKING TO ABOUT THE U.S.
GETTING ACTIVELY EVOLVED IN THE
