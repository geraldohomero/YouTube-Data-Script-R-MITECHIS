entering the keys of a world in
War there are two fundamental issues
that enter the photograph from the
Ukraine war there is no monopoly of
What is happening in Israel grows
The hope of imminent liberation
of 50 reins this morning by the
Terrorist group ever yesterday
two but the hope that of the
200 that there are 50 can be
immediately released the other
Fundamental point comes by how never
accepted that liberation but where and
with whom the negotiation was made with
Qatar and with
Egypt Qatar because there is money
of Iran in the accounts in the accounts
banking is in Qatar between others
6000 million that the United States
released for sale of oil to Iran for
that those 6,000 million will take to
Qatar now says he has blocked it
United States but why Qatar because
Iran's money is there and why
Egypt throughout the situation
of refugees where you can walk
But liberation is accepted
the release of those two reenes after
of the mediation of Qatar and Egypt with what
that we start to see who can solve
Who can disparable photography
current if there is no land invasion there are
Another fundamental point says states
United that is sending more forces to
Middle East John Kirby has added
said they are additional forces in the
region with what the movement of
climbing continues to deepen that
Ukraine environment has knocked 14 drones
Russians and has praised the systems of
Defense received in the last hours
So although it is a bit escohred
In photography the movement in
Ukraine continues in the war in Ukraine and
Russia has damaged a thermal power plant in
Ukraine at the gates of winter not the
minor at the gates of winter of such
way that world at war returns
Again to a photograph of 60 40 50 50
55 45 War of
Ukraine United States War of
Israel United States how it will not upload
The bonus how it will not need more
Money United States how will you not see
The feeling that Bill goes up
Gross I change my bet I wear
short until they burst the economy in
A recession
