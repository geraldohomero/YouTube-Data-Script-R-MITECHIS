What's behind this move and does it
affect a potential offensive in Rafa?
Well, it's probably multiple things that
are behind this move.
One is that they've been fighting now in
Gaza for the better part of six months
and they need to rest and rotate some of
their troops.
So there's probably some truth in that.
There's also the reality they do
reinforce their troops in the north of
Israel, because, of course, that's where
Hezbollah tends to attack from Lebanon.
That's the other Iranian backed group
that's operating in the region and the
aftermath of that airstrike on the
Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria.
There's been repeated warnings from Iran
of some kind of retaliation, and that
might likely come from one of their
proxies, particularly Hezbollah.
Again, so there's a possibility of
stepped up activity in that area.
So you need troops back there.
There's also pulling them back out of
Khan Yunis because they want to be able
to move Palestinians into that area for
an offensive in Rafah.
So none of this suggests that the desire
to go in to have that offensive in Rafa
has dissipated.
This is not withdrawal because of some
other reason.
It's just purely tactical on the part of
Israel.
It's not a withdrawal.
It's taking a break to come back for
more.
So what might Iran, Iranian retaliation
look like for that strike on the
diplomatic compound?
Well, quite possibly through those
proxies.
Really unusual, obviously, a really big
escalation for them to attack Israel
directly, side of fired missiles
directly to a major center in Israel.
That's really basically unprecedented.
So what you might see really is that
kind of proxy activity, primarily
through Hezbollah from from Lebanon,
possibly, again urging the Houthies on
in the Red Sea.
Of course, they've been blocking
shipping in the Red Sea for months now,
maybe some of that.
But really, you can see through the back
channeling that's going on between the
U.S.
and Iran.
They're actually talking about the fact
they're actually talking to each other,
which again, is unusual, shows that
really Iran and the US, despite all of
this, neither neither really want a
direct conflict to happen.
So we're probably see something a little
bit more asymmetric that Iran's known
for.
