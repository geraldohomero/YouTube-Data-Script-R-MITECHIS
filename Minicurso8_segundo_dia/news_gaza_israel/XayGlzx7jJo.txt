snapshots of horror as Hamas terrorists
Gunn down civilians in
Israel they didn't stand a chance the
Israeli government released this short
clip of a much longer collection of
images it's made of the Carnage that
unfolded here on the 7th of October it
needs the world to remember what
triggered Israel's war with Hamas We
Don't parade bodies uh on Tik Tok and on
our social medias like uh our uh
adversaries but we felt it was important
to show the international press what
happened here to understand the the the
tragedy foreign journalists were invited
to watch a 43 minute compilation of the
Bloodshed it's not yet possible
independently to verify all the content
but some of the images like this attack
on a kibutz called Barry have already
been widely seen other footage will
probably never be made public as it's
far too distressing more than 1,400
people were killed and over 200 taken
hostage in the
attack one of the most traumatic Clips
we were shown was of two terrified young
boys and their father running from their
home into a shelter only for a militant
to throw a grenade in after them we see
the father fall to the floor the two
boys emerge bloodied
traumatized they know their father's
dead they call for their mother one even
asks why am I alive the fate of the boys
is not clear officials also released
what they say were documents found on
the militants that allegely reveal
instructions they were given again it's
not been possible to independently
verify the content this one's described
as an abduction manual it says to gather
hostages in several places
anyone who might pose a threat is to be
killed militants are also instructed to
create chaos use violence and terrorism
and kill as a last
resort a former top Commander signaled
Hamas had received outside help from
Iran though he didn't provide proof we
have the evidence of Iranian
involvement uh I cannot elaborate too
much but you
can understand what I mean about not
only about equipment but more than
this as Israeli forces ramp up their
physical fight with Hamas they're also
focused on the information War a key
Battleground but one where Israel
doesn't enjoy the same military
