IN A BAHAMIAN COURT TODAY
FOLLOWING HIS ARREST ON
EIGHT CRIMINAL CHARGES INCLUDING

TO COMMIT FRAUD.
U.S. PROSECUTORS ALLEGE SAM

OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY WORLD, A
STUNNING FALL FROM GRACE,
LEAVING A HEAVILY GUARDED
BAHAMIAN COURTHOUSE, SAM
BANKMAN-FRIED WAS DENIED BAIL,
DEEMED A FLIGHT RISK, FACING A
SLEW OF FINANCIAL CRIMES.
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
FINANCIAL FRAUDS IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.
>> Reporter: U.S. PROPERTIES
ALLEGE HE DECEIVED HIS
CUSTOMERS, TREATING THEIR MONEY,
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LIKE HIS
OWN PERSONAL PIGGY BANK.

TO MAKE UNDISCLOSED VENTURE
INVESTMENTS, LAVISH REAL ESTATE
PURCHASES AND LARGE POLITICAL
DONATIONS.

INNOCENCE.

WAS NO ACCOUNTABILITY, BUT TRUTH
OF THE MATTER IS THIS IS A
STANDARD PONZI SCHEME USING
TECHNOLOGY AS A COVER.
>> Reporter: IF CONVICTED OF
ALL THE CHARGES, BANKMAN-FRIED
COULD FACE UP TO 115 YEARS IN
JAIL, BUT FIRST HE HAS TO GET
HERE.
