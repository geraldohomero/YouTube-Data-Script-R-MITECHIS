Julian, prices are higher by more than
2% today.
But just on on a weekly basis, oil is
lower.
How much of the daily moves are
sustainable when it comes to some of the
geopolitical tension?
I think the moves upwards are only
sustainable if the tensions remain high
and if those tensions continue to
rise.
I mean, I think that what we're seeing
is a market that is perhaps
fundamentally weakening to some degree,
being propped up on the physical side by
opec+ output cuts and on the
geopolitical side, by the rising
tensions in the Middle East.
In terms of the tightness of the market,
I'm curious to get your take.
We're looking at Cushing, we're looking
at global inventories, the lowest in a
couple of years.
So that is a a tightening market which
Opec+ will welcome it because we just
simply don't know where this war goes
to.
No, we don't.
We don't.
So does that tightening, that physical
tightening at that draw, does that
create a floor for opec+ the is doing
for for OPEC what the journey that they
set out.
Well, I think yeah.
And I think a lot of this is due to what
vopak or let's you know cut to the chase
Saudi Arabia has done in cutting 2
million barrels of supply and extending
those cuts to the end of the year and
potentially, you know, they could extend
them further still.
That's taken a lot of oil out of the
market, which has tightened that
balance.
But within that, we are seeing refinery
margins weakening.
So this is the, you know, the earnings
of refiners who are turning the crude
oil into the fuels that we need.
We're seeing shipping costs rising.
So that's making it more expensive to
deliver crude, for example, from the US
elsewhere.
That's putting pressure on physical
markets and that is undermining some of
the the strength that opaque is trying
to create.
