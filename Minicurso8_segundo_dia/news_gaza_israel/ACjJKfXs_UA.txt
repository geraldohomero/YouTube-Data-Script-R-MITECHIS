NEWS OUT OF ISRAEL.
THIS AFTERNOON, THE IDF
REVEALING THAT THEY HAVE
RECOVERED THE BODIES OF FIVE
ISRAELI HOSTAGES.
IN HAMAS TUNNELS UNDERNEATH

E.J., WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS?
>> RICHARD, FINDING THIS OUT IN
THE LAST 30 MINUTES OR SO THAT
THE IDF DID LOOK AT THE FIVE
BODIES OF ISRAELI SOLDIERS.
THEY WERE INSIDE THE TUNNELS.
THOSE BODIES HAVE BEEN
RECOVERED AND THEY SAY RETURNED
TO ISRAEL.
IT IS AN OPERATION TO DISMANTLE
HAMAS'S NORTHERN UNDERGROUND
HEADQUARTERS, AND SO THAT'S
WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING
AND HAVE BEEN OVER THE PAST 24
TO 48 HOURS, TRYING TO GET
THROUGH AND INTO SOME OF THOSE
TUNNELS AND CLEAR THEM OUT, AND
THAT'S WHERE THEY MADE THIS
TRAGIC DISCOVERY.
EFFORTS TO DO CONTINUE
ACCORDING TO THE IDF TO
ELIMINATE THE TUNNEL NETWORK
AND NOT ONLY KHAN YOUNIS BUT
THE SOUTHERN PART OF GAZA AS
WELL.
SO, THIS IS AN ONGOING MISSION,
AND SOME IN THE IDF HAS SAID
THEY ARE TARGETING OVER THE
LAST AND THEY SAID 24 TO 48
HOURS, RICHARD.
>> JAY, LET'S GO NORTH.
YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTING ABOUT
MISSILE LAUNCHES, TO THE NORTH.
THEY ARE ON THE BORDER OF
LEBANON.
NOT NEW, BUT WE HAVE HEARD OF
YET MORE LAUNCHES.
HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT?
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.

SINCE THIS WAR BEGAN.
IT COMES ON IDEA DEFENSE FORCES
CARRYING OUT WHAT THEY CALL
WIDE GALE STRIKES AGAINST
HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON.
THERE YOU SIGNIFICANT FORCE.
FOLLOWING WHAT THEY SAY WAS A
BARRAGE OF ROCKETS FIRED ON
COMMUNITIES IN ISRAEL.
WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE STRIKES
IN ISRAEL, BUT WE HAVE ALSO
BEEN TOLD THAT THERE WERE NO
INJURIES AND NO --
AS A RESULT OF THOSE STRIKES.
BUT, AGAIN, THINGS RAMPING UP
TO THE NORTH AS WELL.
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCERN,
