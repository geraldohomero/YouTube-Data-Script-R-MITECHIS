we're going to face this eviction by
being steadfast by being persistent by
not leaving our homes our rightful homes
we're going to fight until our very last

you know my happy memories in do not
differ much from anybody's
happy memories in their home you know my
childhood was here my coming of age was
here
so much of my teenage years was here i
was readying i'm here to go to
undergrad school in the united states
um it's a it's a beautiful house yeah
because it's in jerusalem it's so
central and near to the old city
and i've learned a lot from being in

i feel extreme fury towards the attempts
of displacement
at the hands of settler organizations
and the israeli government to displace
us and our neighbors from
but i also don't feel much surprise this
is not something that is unorthodox for
the israeli government it has been a
continuation of the
zionist project in palestine since 1948
the entire this entire country was
established
through destroying palestinian villages
and um displacing palestinian refugees
and now um this policy of colonial
expansion has replaced
an artillery with a judicial system that
is inherently colonial inherently
asymmetrical and biased towards israeli
jews
[Music]
yes

our ability to be on social media and
call this what it is called this
ethnic cleansing has allowed us to reach
a lot of people
but i must say that even social media
companies are now censoring us
and we're seeing many of the posts
disappearing from many media platforms
like instagram and facebook
[Music]
do
[Music]
we are just a community of individuals a
community of refugees
going against a system an entire army of
occupation forces
who will not hesitate to use brutal
force against us
because they have been able to use
brutal force against palestinians
for decades because they've been able to
get away with it with impunity
because the international community
still refuses to hold israel accountable
for its actions and violations against
palestinians
