,
THESE HORRIBLE HEADLINES THAT WE
SEE AROUND THE WORLD WILL
ESSENTIALLY BE THE BASELINE OF
OUR FUTURE.
IT WOULD BE THIS OR EVEN WORSE.
AS WE GET CLOSER TO THIS
1.5-DEGREE THRESHOLD.
>> Todd: LET'S GO TO MONTRÃ‰AL.
CAROLINA STANDING BY THE ACT --
ACT DURING DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE
NETWORK CANADA.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU AS PART OF OUR
COVERAGE.
WHAT DO PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT THE STORY OR THE TAKEAWAY?
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
THIS REPORT IS REALLY THE LAST
WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM IPCC
SCIENTISTS SINCE 2028 AND IT
SAYS WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FOR
THE PAST YEARS WHICH IS ACTING
WITHOUT DELAY IS NOT ONLY THE
SAFEST THING WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW
BUT THE CHEAPEST WE CAN DO.
IF WE WANT TO AVOID THE
CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS THAT COME
WITH MOVING ABOVE THIS CRUCIAL
1.5 DEGREES THRESHOLD WE MUST
TRANSFORM ALL SECTORS AND
SYSTEMS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS,
INVEST IN ADAPTATION AND RESPOND
TO LOSSES AND DAMAGES AT THE
SCALE AND SPEED NEEDED.
>> Todd: WHAT DO YOU THINK THE
BIGGEST OBSTACLE IS STANDING IN
THE WAY OF COUNTRIES MAKING THIS
HAPPEN?
>> THE REPORT IS VERY CLEAR ON
THAT AND THAT WHAT IS MISSING IS
THE POLITICAL COMMITMENT TO
ENACT THESE TRANSFORMATIONS OF
OUR SYSTEM THAT WILL ENABLE TO
HELP GLOBAL EMISSIONS BY 2030 IN
LINE WITH WHAT THE SCIENCE
DEMANDS AND WE KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS IN TERMS OF THE FOSSIL
FUEL SECTOR, THE REPORT IS VERY
CLEAR ABOUT THAT AS WELL AND
SHOWS THAT IF WE WANT TO AVOID
OVERSHOOT AND LIMIT EMISSIONS IN
THE TRAJECTORY THAT'S NEEDED WE
REALLY NEED TO TACKLE THE
SECTORS CONTINUED EXPANSION
IMMEDIATELY AS WELL AS IT'S HOLD
ON POLICY WHICH HAS PREVENTED
CLIMATE ACTION FOR DECADES.
>> Todd: WHAT WOULD AN
INCREASE MEAN FOR CANADA FOR
EXAMPLE?
>> ONCE WE GET ABOVE THAT
CRUCIAL THRESHOLD WE ARE MOVING
ABOVE WHAT WE CALL THE TIPPING
POINT AND THESE CHANGES BECOME
IRREVERSIBLE SO WE'VE ALREADY
BEEN SEEING INCREASED FREQUENCY
AND INTENSITY OF THESE CLIMATE
EVENTS LIKE FLOODS, HURRICANES,
HEAT STROKES, THESE TYPE OF
THINGS WILL BECOME MORE
FREQUENT, MORE INTENSE,
SIMILARLY FOR LOW, ONSET EVENTS
LIKE DROUGHTS AS WELL AS THE
RISE IN SEA LEVEL SO
1.5 DEGREES, ONCE WE GET ABOVE
THAT IT'S TRULY A DEATH SPELL
FOR MANY COUNTRIES IN THE GLOBAL
SOUTH WHO UNFORTUNATELY PHA
