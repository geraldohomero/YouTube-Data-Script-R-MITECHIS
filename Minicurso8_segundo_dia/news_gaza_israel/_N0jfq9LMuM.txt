Large operation against frequent havoc in the city
Running but Israeli in these operations
Soldiers to lose loss of life
It is falling but despite this Israeli
Defense Force means Hamas in IDF areas
Alakasim Brigade and Al Kuj of military wing of
Clash with brigade
On the other hand, Alkasim Brigade and Alak

Tanks and military vehicles from rocket attack

However this is not the first time in Gaza
There are such attacks over IDF
Rather, even before this, Hamas has many such
Videos released

More than 570 soldiers have been killed
Although in reality that figure is more than that
There may be more about Hamas

I have more than 12000 Hamas fighters
Has piled up tell that inside Gaza
Hamas's more active fighters than 3 Haj
