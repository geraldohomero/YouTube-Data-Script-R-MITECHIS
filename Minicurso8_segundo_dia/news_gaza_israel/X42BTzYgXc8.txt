I but an interest
in I have in my many years as a
humanitarian worker never seen a
population so bombarded over such a long
time in such a crowded area with no
Escape so this situation is screaming
for a Seas fire it has to be fixed now
by the United States Egypt Qatar and
those who are negotiating and Israel
which has this overwhelming
military force needs to understand that
the population that is being bombarded
is by and large totally innocent they
had nothing to do with the 7th of
October the hostages have to be released
by these armed militia
men they should go home but the the
civilian population which is paying the
price here for for this enormous
military campaign which is waged with
American British German arms must also
end immediately not a day more of this
bled there is too little food there is
really no uh clean water available there
is epidemic disease and there is
malnutrition and it's the same in school
of
school
in the far north where people are in a
famine situation there is no other way
to describe it because there hasn't been
Aid there for a long time 300,000 people
are in the north we want to reach them
we want to to go beyond
Rafa where where conditions also very
bad but it's very very hard
because only a few trucks come over the
border every day and many of them are
even looted by desperate people who
haven't gotten gotten Aid we need a
ceasefire so we can have rational
organized humanitarian work across the
Gaza Strip the Kuwait industrial site
was a a projected industrial site people
broke in out of
desperation 300 families that got 300
family tents by NRC now there are
27,000 people in this stretch of uh of
of desert of of of sand and they are
yearning for peace they are yearning for
a ceasefire they are at the limit at the
moment
