 BRIAN: 
 PETE: YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE 
 GAZA STRIP AS ISRAELIS CONTINUE
 THE GROUND PUSH INTO HAMAS 
 STRONGHOLD.
 PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU SAYS 
 THEY DON'T PLAN ON PRESSING 
 PAUSE ANYTIME SOON.
 BRIGADIER GENERAL ROB SPALDING 
 JOINS US TO REACT.
 AMERICA - SECRETARY OF STATE 
 TRYING TO PUSH A PAUSE, DON'T 
 KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 
 PAUSE OR A CEASE-FIRE.
 BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYS THEY 
 WILL CONTINUE.
 WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE 
 SITUATION?
 >> ANY PAUSE IS GOING TO LEAD 
 TO FURTHER ISRAELI DEATHS AND 
 MORE TROOPS GETTING KILLED 
 DURING THE INVASION OR IT IS 
 GOING TO LEAD TO MORE ISRAELIS 
 GETTING KILLED BECAUSE HAMAS 
 THINKS IT CAN GET AWAY WITH IT 
 SO I DON'T THINK IT BENEFITS 
 THE CIVILIANS IN GAZA BECAUSE 
 HAMAS DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THEM 
 ANYWAY.
 THEY ARE USING THIS TO GET MORE
 ISRAELIS.
 PETE: ISRAEL HAS TO KEEP 
 PRESSING IF THEY WANT TO 
 MAINTAIN MOMENTUM.
 >> ABSOLUTELY.
 THEY NEED TO TAKE DEFENSE AND 
 READ GAZA OF HAMAS.
 WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THAT.
 WE SHOULDN'T BE ADVOCATING A 
 PAUSE AT ALL.
 WE WOULDN'T BE PAUSING IF THIS 
 WAS US.
 PETE: WHY ARE WE ADVOCATING A 
 PAUSE.
 WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
 >> IT IS PART OF THE PROPAGANDA
 EFFORT NOT JUST HAMAS PUTTING 
 FORWARD BUT IRAN, CHINA, 
 RUSSIA.
 FULL-COURT PRESS AND BASICALLY 
 BLASTING OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
 OVER THINGS LIKE TIKTOK.
 THE ADMINISTRATION IS FEELING A
 FALSE SENSE OF PRESSURE, WE 
 SHOULDN'T CARE WHAT THOSE 
 PEOPLE THINK.
 PETE: IT INCLUDES THE HOUSE OF 
 REPRESENTATIVES AT A MASSIVE 
 RALLY IN WASHINGTON DC.
 WOULD YOU CHANGE ANYTHING 
 MILITARILY, IS THE US POSTURE 
 CORRECT?
 FORGET STATEMENTS ABOUT PAUSES 
 BUT POSITIONING OF FORCES.
 >> WE'VE SPENT SO MANY 
 MUNITIONS AND UKRAINE, WE ARE 
 WORN OUT.
 MILITARY IS ALREADY WORN OUT 
 FROM MORES IN AFGHANISTAN AND A
 RAT, NOW UKRAINE, WE DON'T HAVE
 MUNITIONS BUT WE ARE FLAT BROKE
 IN TERMS OF READINESS IN THE 
 MILITARY SO WE'VE DONE WHAT WE 
 CAN.
 PETE: I'VE HEARD THE SAME THING
 WHEN YOU GET YOURSELF 
 OVEREXTENDED AND OUT OF AMMO 
 THAT'S A BAD PLACE TO
