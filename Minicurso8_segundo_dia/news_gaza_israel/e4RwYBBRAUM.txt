standard itself and they are ashamed to
show it but she keeps trying okay let's

views went up and people are sharing the
stories and we're back on the news speed
again H organization has been monitoring
censorship of the Palestinian content
for years in the past week hamla
detected more than
35,000 posts in Hebrew promoting fake
news incitement and hate speech meta
does not censor content in the Hebrew
language that is associated with
escalation like it does with Arabic
content because the Hebrew content
sometimes is sponsored by the state or
the military while the Arabic content is
non-state actors which meta could deem
as um illegal content Jalel says

many are subjected to political pressure
MAA says this is not true they say their
policies are designed to give everyone a
