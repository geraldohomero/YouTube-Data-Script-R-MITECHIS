Biden he's terrible worst president in
our history by worst president he's the
worst president he's the most
incompetent president when I'm back in
the White House the United States
will'll stand with Israel all the way
100% without hesitation without
qualification and with without any
apology we're not going to be
apologizing we won't be
apologizing we're not going to be
apologizing we will fully support the
Israelis in their mission to ensure that
Hamas is decimated and these atrocities
will be Avenged they will be Avenged
many ways they'll be Avenged I think
even beyond what you're thinking about
Joe Biden's weakness caused the attack
on Israel pure weakness
and incompetence everywhere he goes
Biden's weakness provokes war and death
because as history shows evil only
respects one thing unyielding

if Israel wants to destroy Hamas Israel
should go ahead and Destroy
Hamas I'm just getting started if Israel
wants to destroy Hezbollah Israel should
go ahead and Destroy
Hezbollah if Israel and mad want to pull
off Munich 2.0 and take out every last
leader of Hamas wherever they may be
hiding from Doha to Dresden h a red
wedding at the Four Seasons in Cutter
the next time Han and masal show up they
should go ahead and do it if Israel
wants to at long last abandon the myth
of a two-state solution Israel should go
ahead and abandon a two-state
solution the rest of the Arab world can
absorb Palestinians just as the Jews
absorbed their people out of 22
countries they were kicked out of since
1948
