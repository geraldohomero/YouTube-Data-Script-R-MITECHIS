>>> NEW TENSION AT COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY WHEN PRO-PALESTINIAN
AND PRO-ISRAELI DEMONSTRATORS
FACED OFF. DOUG WILLIAMS HAS
MORE ON THIS. DOUG?
>> Reporter: MARY, WE ARE
ACROSS BROADWAY FROM THE MAIN
CAMPUS TO THE ENTRANCE TO
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. YOU CAN
SEE BEHIND ME A SMALL
DEMONSTRATION, 10 TO 15 OR SO
PRO-PALESTINIAN DEMONSTRATION
GOING ON. THE STORY IS WHAT
HAPPENED THIS MORNING AFTER
DUELING DEMONSTRATIONS,
PRO-PALESTINIAN AND PRO-ISRAELI
STUDENTS STARTED YESTERDAY.
THIS MORNING THINGS ESCALATED.
ARRESTS JUST AFTER 8:00 A.M.
THURSDAY MORTGAGE AS SMALL
PRO-PALESTINIAN DEMONSTRATIONS
WERE TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE OF
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS
GATES. SOME DEMONSTRATORS NOT
PLEASED WITH HOW THEY SAY
POLICE HANDLED THE SITUATION.
>> THERE WAS NO POINT OF EVER
WORKING WITH THE POLICE, YOU
KNOW. EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,
THEY WERE ESCALATING.
>> Reporter: IT'S NOT CLEAR
HOW MANY ARRESTS WERE MADE
THURSDAY MORNING. ACCORDING TO
DEMONSTRATORS, POLICE STARTED
DETAINING THEM FOR BLOCKING THE
ENTRANCE TO THE SUBWAY WHICH
THEY SAY WAS NOT THE CASE.
>> NOT ALLOWING US TO EXERCISE
OUR RIGHTS.
>> Reporter: SHE TESTIFIED ON
CAPITOL HILL FAILING TO
DISCIPLINE STUDENTS FOR
ANTI-SEMETIC RHETORIC.
>> COLUMBIA HAS SHOWN OVER AND
OVER AGAIN THAT THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT STUDENT RIGHTS,
STUDENT VOICES. THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT STUDENT SAFETY.
>> I HAVE GOTTEN NASTY COMMENTS
ON ME AND I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS
ACCEPTED.
>> Reporter: A WARNING TO
COLUMBIA STUDENTS FROM THE
UNIVERSITY FOR THOSE WHO
INTERRUPT CAMPUS EVENTS.
PRO-PALESTINIAN STUDENTS SET UP
TENTS ON THE CAMPUS SOUTH LAWN.
THEY WERE TOLD TO LEAVE BY 9:00
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. UNCLEAR IF ANY
STUDENTS REMAIN INSIDE. AND AS
YOU CAN SEE, DESPITE THE FACT
THAT THE CURRENT DEMONSTRATION
IS SMALL AND VERY MUCH
PEACEFUL, YOU CAN SEE THERE IS
A HANDFUL OF POLICE OFFICERS IN
THE MIDDLE OF BROADWAY SINCE WE
ARRIVED THIS MORNING IN FULL
RIOT GEAR SHOULD THINGS
ESCALATE. FROM WHAT WE HAVE
BEEN TOLD, THE VAST MAJORITY OF
THE PROTESTERS AND
DEMONSTRATORS AS OF THIS
MORNING, WERE NOT COLUMBIA
STUDENTS LIKE ONE OF THE WOMEN
