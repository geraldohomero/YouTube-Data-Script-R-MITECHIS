AS ISRAEL'S GROUND INVASION
LOOMS.
HEARTBREAKING FOR THOSE
FAMILIES.
SEVERAL FLIGHTS STARTED
ARRIVING OVER THE WEEKEND.
JOHN DIAS JOINS US WHERE HE
SPOKE WITH TRAVELERS.
WE SPEAK, FLIGHT TRAVELING
FROM TEL AVIV HERE TO NEWARK
LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
FEW MINUTES AGO, CARRYING
DOZENS OF PEOPLE ESCAPING THE
WAR-TORN COUNTRY OF ISRAEL.
EMOTIONS ARE DEFINITELY
RUNNING HIGH FOR THESE
HOME SAFELY TO AMERICA, NOT
KNOWING WHEN THEY WILL RETURN
BACK TO ISRAEL OR WHAT THEY
WILL RETURN TO IN THE FUTURE.
I SPENT MY TRIP CRYING
BASICALLY. EVERY HOUR OR SO,
OH, MY GOD.
Reporter: THIS DOCTOR SAID
HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE
HIS FAMILY IN ISRAEL TO GET
BACK TO HIS PRACTICE IN QUEENS.
HE WAS ABLE TO GET A DIRECT
FLIGHT BECAUSE HE BOOKED IT A
WHILE AGO.
HAD TO DO.
Reporter: OTHERS HAVE BEEN
HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME
ESCAPING LIKE THIS FAMILY OF
NINE FROM NEW YORK. THEY WERE
IN ISRAEL FOR A MONTH AND HAD
TO TAKE A CHARTER FLIGHT TO
LONDON THEN TO JFK.
WE WERE SCARED TO GO OUT AND
WERE UNABLE TO GET BACK TO NEW
YORK.
Reporter: MANY MAJOR
AIRLINES HAVE SUSPENDED DIRECT
FLIGHTS TO ISRAEL AND BACK FOR
THE NEAR FUTURE. THE STATE
CHARTER FLIGHTS OUT OF ISRAEL
TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE.
SHE IS IN CYPRUS THANKS TO A
CHARTER FLIGHT . SHE, HER
GRANDMA, AND ROOMMATE GOT OUT
OF TEL AVIV.
WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE
CAN TO HELP, BUT AT THE SAME
TIME, YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR
SAFETY FIRST.
Reporter: FINDING A FLIGHT
OUT OF ISRAEL CONTINUES TO BE A
STRUGGLE.
EVERYTHING WAS EITHER
ENOUGH. IT WOULD BE IN TWO
WEEKS OR A WEEK AND A HALF. BY
THEN, IT'S NOT SAFE TO STAY
THERE.
Reporter: A LIVE LOOK BACK
OUT HERE AT THE AIRPORT. THIS
IS THE HALLWAY WHERE THE
TRAVELERS WILL BE COMING DOWN
ONCE THEY GO THROUGH CUSTOMS.
THEY WILL COME OUT HERE HEADING
BACK HOME. WE KNOW THE ONE
PLAIN FROM TEL AVIV JUST
LANDED IN THERE TWO WAS
SCHEDULED TO LAND THROUGHOUT
THE MORNING, SO WE WILL TALK
WITH THESE PASSENGERS
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WE WILL
