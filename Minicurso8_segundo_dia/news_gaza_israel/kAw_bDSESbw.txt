Hello I find in Ashkelon one of the
Israel populations that have suffered the most
In this war wave after wave of
missiles have been launched here since the
Saturday and maybe you can hear
the explosions of the iron dome that
intercept the missiles of ever many
have given in the target I met in the
elevator to a man who although
spoke English or Spanish only Hebrew me
He understood that he was at the hotel
Because a missile never destroyed
totally your home and that is just the
first person I know here in
Ashkelon
But I also wanted to comment on a
article that seemed to me eh very very very
Interesting your writer is Hussein Ibish
of the Institute of States of the Arab Gulf
in
Washington The premise of your article is
that Israel's land offensive to
Gaza who already seems like a fact and there is already
Some small incursions at least is
Actually a huge mistake first the
Article maintains that the counteroffensive
from Israel and above all the very possible
Large -scale incursion is a trap
Two says that is what he never wants
not because they will win but because that
He goes with his plan and what he thinks is the
plan of
He never says that Israel can't destroy
ever totally by force and that
He never wants a long confrontation in
The Gaza Strip for which also
It must be
prepared would not have launched that attack
Without preparing he says that never
I would have done what he did without knowing that
Israel would react as it is
doing and are waiting for them
lose many soldiers keep the
Article and that finally what you want
It is never to obtain so much support with your
resistance that finally unreason
Fatah is to say the Palestinian authority
that sis Jordan governs remember that
The Gaza Strip never governs
Basically you want to stay with
The entire Palestinian territory says this
Author and the article ends the best
For Israel it would be although of course it is
very difficult to do that will show calm
cold -head
invade and on the other hand continue with the
Paz's plans with Arabia
Saudi and that would give him a strong
hit the plans of ever and therefore
Iran
