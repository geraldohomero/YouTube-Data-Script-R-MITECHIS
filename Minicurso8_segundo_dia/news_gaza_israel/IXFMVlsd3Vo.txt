OFFICIALS IN GAZA AND ISRAEL AS
WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ARE
BLAMING EACH OTHER FOR THE
BLAST.
GAZA JOURNALIST IS AT A
DIFFERENT HOSPITAL IN GAZA AND
HAS THIS REPORT.
>> Reporter: PALESTINIANS ARE
OUTRAGED BY THE LATEST
INCIDENTS OF TARGETING THE
HOSPITAL IN THE GAZA STRIP.
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED,
THE MAGNITUDE, THE NATURE OF
THE PLACE TARGETED INCLUDING
THE FACT THIS IS A PLACE OF
SPIRITUAL RELIGIOUS VALUE AND
ALSO IT PROVIDES SERVICE TO A
LARGE NUMBER OF PALESTINIANSING
AND ALSO IT WAS -- SEEKING
SAFETY IN THAT PLACE.
THAT SHOOK THE PALESTINIANS.
THAT MADE THEM FEEL THAT
INSECURITY IS PREVAILING AND
THERE IS NO SAFE HAVEN.
THEY WERE SURE THERE WAS NO
SAFE HAVEN IN GAZA BUT THIS IS
ANOTHER EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS
ANOTHER EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS
NO SAFE HAVEN IN THE GAZA
STRIP.
HAMAS AND THE PALESTINIAN FROM
-- ACCUSATIONS.
THERE'S NO FORMAL STATEMENT
MADE BY THE PALESTINIAN
RESISTANCE ON THAT PARTICULAR
ISSUE.
THE MATTER OF FACT THAT A
ROCKET ACCORDING TO THE EXPERT
AS ROCKET THAT HIT AND KILLED
900 PEOPLE CANNOT BE A
PALESTINIAN ROCKET.
THIS IS AN ARGUMENT WE HEAR
FROM THE PALESTINIAN SIDE.
THE MAGNITUDE, THE IMPACT, THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED ARE ALL
INDICATING THAT ACCORDING TO
THE EXPERTS THAT ISRAELI
OCCUPATION IS THE ONE PARTY
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT SITUATION.
THE COMMUNITY, THE MEDICAL
COMMUNITY IN GAZA.
PEOPLE ARE FEELING A DEEPENING
FEELING OF INSECURITY
ACCOMPANIED FROM THAT INCIDENT.
ALSO FEAR FROM WHATEVER IS
COMING THEY SEE THAT AS ONE
MORE STEP TOWARDS PUSHING
PALESTINIANS MORE TOWARDS EGYPT
FOR DISPLACEMENT PROGRAM THAT
THEY SEE IN PLACE.
THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN
STRUGGLING NOW WITH THE LOSS OF
ONE HOSPITAL THAT CAME OUT OF
SERVICE.
THERE IS INCREASED BURDEN ON
THE EXISTING HOSPITALS THAT
WERE ANNOUNCED TO BE FALLING
APART.
THAT WERE ANNOUNCED TO BE
COLLAPSING UNDER THE HEAVY
BURDEN RESULTING FROM IT THE
INFLUX OF INJURED PEOPLE AND
ALSO THEY DON'T HAVE PLACES TO
SAVE THE BODIES.
AROUND THEM AND IN FRONT OF
THEM THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF
BODIES OF PEOPLE KILLED AND
BODIES OF PEOPLE KILLED AND
THEY DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO STORE
THEM.
