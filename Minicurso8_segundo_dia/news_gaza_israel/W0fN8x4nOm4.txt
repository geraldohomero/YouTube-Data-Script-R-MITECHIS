See Israel now the mark of Hamas
By preparing for ground war to erase
Israeli army tanks have been continuously moving
Are and Israel's first target
The place is where Hamas terrorists
First attacked because at this time the most
More movement is happening from the same place
Israeli Gaz is still dead in war
The number has crossed 3500 but
How much more will be known in this now
Hard because war is intensifying
And Israel has given an ultimatum that she
Soon of Tanks and Ground Troops
Through the Gaza strip will climb at this time
I am present in the Farah area where
Terrorists entered and they got these cottages
Broke and this is from here in the history of Israel
That mark to start a new war
Leave it due to which Israeli is strip
The area did not have to ment
But now preparations are being made for the attack
Air via ground troupes and tanks
Strike continues continuously and this area
Is in which not only in cottages
People were killed and their houses were broken
But many people have also been taken hostage
And the same hostage is now more for Israel
The border remains a cause for concern
People of Hamas came crossed by Hamas
Terrorists first attack from this border
Sticking with adjacent border
In the area with cottages where people
Used to come to celebrate his weekend but now
The picture of terror for the elimination of Hamas
Israel will become history written here
Opportunity for and covering that history
