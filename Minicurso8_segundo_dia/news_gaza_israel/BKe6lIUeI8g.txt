We mentioned it right with Claire
Duamel Hello Mariam Pirzadé Hello
Pauline a lot of questions
pending this morning on
the possibility of preparing a
terrestrial operation in Gaza but which
would be conditioned supervised by the fate
Hostages Israeli Government
speaks of a hundred people at the
times civilians and soldiers
kidnapped by Ramas and Jihad
Islamic yes what makes you complicated
it is the geography of the of the band of
Gaza she is 40 km long she is
12 km 360 km Carr we go
Surely see a card so the margin of
maneuver of a terrestrial operation
remain complicated by for the army
Israeli as much as there are
hostages in these buildings in Gaza we
know their laptops have limited in the
Gaza band for many Hamas
actually uses this socket
hostage as a kind of shield
human to slow down and prevent it
makes a land attack on the
part of the Israeli army and also
to obtain in exchange the release of
their prisoners who are in the
prisons the Israeli prisons we
Reminds the sergeant of Gilatchalit
extremely known Francoisraélien whose
photography
was everywhere in the country for 5 years
5 years in the Gaza Strip in
inhuman conditions eh that's what
had declared the UN at the time it was
detainee he was exchanged forgiveness for
1027 uh Palestinian prisoners
Today there are 4,500 prisoners
Palestinians in prisons
Israeli who are condemned or in
Court of judgment for activity
terrorist therefore Hamas actually hopes
use currency
to exchange euh his civilians and his
Israeli soldiers against their
prisoners to them but these hostages are
state trauma just as was
really guilat chalit we see uh in
Uh newspapers in television
Israeli appels to help
their relatives of their parents who are
feel completely helpless and
completely left to their
sad fate by the government and
by security forces
Israeli thank you very much Mariam you
