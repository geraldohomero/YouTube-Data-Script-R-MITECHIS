THINGS, WE DON'T KNOW THE
CONDITION THAT THEY WERE
TRANSPORTED IN. ALL RIGHT.
STEPHEN, DIAL AT BOWIE HIGH
SCHOOL. STEPHEN. THANKS SEVERAL
PROTESTERS WERE DETAINED DURING
A PRO-PALESTINE PROTEST ON THE
UT AUSTIN CAMPUS THIS AFTERNOON.
SO TODAY'S PROTEST AT UT AUSTIN
MIRRORED THOSE SEEN ON CAMPUSES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HUNDREDS OF
STUDENTS WALKED OUT OF CLASS,
AND THEY PLANNED A MARCH AND A
SIT IN ON CAMPUS. OFFICERS WERE
BROUGHT IN TO TRY TO DISPERSE
THE CROWD, AND THE GOVERNOR
CHEERED ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
RESPONSE ON SOCIAL MEDIA,
SUGGESTING PROTESTERS SHOULD BE
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL. FOX FOUR'S
SEAN RAB IN STUDIO NOW WITH THE
LATEST. SEAN AND HEATHER. OF
COURSE. WE'VE BEEN WATCHING
THESE PROTESTS PLAY OUT OVER THE
ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR ACROSS THE
COUNTRY TODAY, COMING TO THE
LONE STAR STATE, MANY ACROSS THE
STATE TODAY, BUT THE BIGGEST,
MOST VOCAL AND AT TIMES TENSE ON
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT
AUSTIN CAMPUS. LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE VIDEO. AUSTIN POLICE AND
STATE TROOPERS AT TIMES TANGLED
WITH DEMONSTRATORS AT UT LAW
ENFORCEMENT, FORMING LINES
ACROSS THE CAMPUS TO TRY AND
PREVENT THE STUDENTS FROM
MARCHING THROUGH THE CAMPUS, AT
TIMES AGAIN CLASHING WITH
PROTESTERS. AT LEAST TWO DOZEN
DEMONSTRATORS ARE DETAINED, ALL
OF THIS AS CLASSES FOR OTHERS
CONTINUED ON CAMPUS. THE
UNIVERSITY AND THE STATEMENT
WARNED IT WOULD NOT TOLERATE
DISRUPTIONS LIKE THOSE AT OTHER
CAMPUSES. A SMALL CROWD OF
COUNTER PROTESTERS WERE PRESENT
AS THE DEMONSTRATION GREW BOTH
IN SIZE AND INTENSITY. I WOULD
WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON ON
COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND I WOULD SEE
PEOPLE SHOUTING NOT FOR PEACE.
THEY WERE SHOUTING FOR THE
DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL. THEY WERE
SHOUTING FOR AN INTIFADA. THEY
WERE SHOUTING FOR THE DEATH OF
THE ZIONISM AND I JUST, I, I
STAND FOR PEACE, I WANT PEACE. I
DON'T THINK THIS PROTEST STANDS
FOR PEACE. PROTESTERS SAY THEY
HAD PLANNED TO WALK OUT AND
MARCH TO THE MAIN CAMPUS, WHERE
SPEECHES AND EVENTS WERE
PLANNED. THE RALLY, ORGANIZED BY
THE PALESTINE SOLIDARITY
UT AUSTIN DIVEST FROM
MANUFACTURERS SUPPLYING ISRAEL
WEAPONS IN ITS STRIKES ON GAZA.
GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT EXPRESSED
SUPPORT FOR THE ARRESTS THAT
