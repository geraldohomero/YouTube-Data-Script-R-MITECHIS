these are the most tragic of
days um I have just come from
the border of the rougher Crossing I'm
now just on the outside of the compound
and we could uh
see Gaza at least we could see cranes
that were on the territory of Gaza we
couldn't go any closer I very much hope
to be able to enter Gaza and also uh
going to Israel on this particular
Mission the suffering of children and
women and men old and young um is
profound and it is ongoing as the
Secretary General of the United Nations
has said as the head of uh ocher has
said Martin Griffith as the head of the
World Health Organization has said
there's a dire humanitarian situation
developing that we have uh active
investigations ongoing in relation to
the crimes allegedly committed in Israel
on the 7th of October uh and also in
relation to Gaza and the West Bank and
our jurisdiction going back to
2014 this a moment of objectivity is a
moment of quiet reflection and it ISS to
be a moment in which the International
Community and the international
architecture built on the rubble of the
second world war the
terrible gas Chambers and the
Holocaust the raising of cities
throughout of Europe was meant to create
institutions that would ensure never
again would we see Abominations where
people could be targeted because of
their race their religion their culture
where they come from or what passport
they
hold those promises need to be
fulfilled we're independent
independently looking
at the situation in Palestine we are
looking at the
events in Israel and the allegations
that uh Palestinian Nationals have also
committed crimes we need cooperation we
need assistance but with we going to
have the
determination the stamina and the
professionalism to make sure we separate
allegation from fact that we can look at
the evidence investigate incriminating
and exonerating evidence equally and
most
fundamentally at this moment underline
the fact that there should not be any
impediment to humanitarian relief
supplies going to children to women and
men civilians they are in ENT they have
rights under International humanitarian
law these rights are part of custody
international law these rights are part
of the Geneva conventions and they give
rise to even criminal responsibility
when these rights are cailed under the
Rome
statute
