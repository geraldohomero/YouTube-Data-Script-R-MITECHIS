because making war requires
to mobilize enormous resources and
this mobilization of resources it
can take place very far from the fields of
[Music]
battle with the war in Ukraine we
is really at a crossroads
which both reveals our vulurabilities
reveal our dependence on energies
fossils and understood in energies
state fossils that have proven to be
Hostile environmental impacts
Destruction can be multiple
first of all ecosystems therefore the
forest which is destroyed massively
During the First World War on
A whole surface of territory
especially French called the area
[Music]
red
[Music]
Even today the red zone is
A place where there are metals
heavy where we pushed forests
To try to fix these metals we have
Depollution issues we have
soil pollution issues
and this we really talk about a
emblematic battlefield he celi
first war
global
There are other effects that are a bit
more complicated in as part of
conflict is the remote effects
because making war requires
to mobilize enormous resources and
this mobilization of resources it
can take place very far from the fields of
battle of the thousands of sites distributed over
the entire surface of the globe which are
storage production sites
recycling and nuclear weapons
French American nucleair French
in the Pacific who have notably
destroyed atols we have of course
health effects We have situations
dramatic in terms of prevalence of
[Music]
cancer we also know that the armies are
extremely waste producing
chemicals and that is reinforced by the
that often in legislation
We have derogations from legislation and
to ordinary regulations when
These are military activities so we have
In addition an exceptional species of state
for the armies that are still going
strengthen environmental effects
harmful to their
[Music]
Activity the problem of activity
military and conflict is that this
are situations where life and death
fighters are sometimes engaged in
life and death of nations and facing
this emergency in the face of this extreme state
tension uh concerns
environmental often goes to
second plan the state of exception that
Creates the conflict it actually creates
releases in terms of use in terms of
non -regulation which are then in
sort of
irreversible
