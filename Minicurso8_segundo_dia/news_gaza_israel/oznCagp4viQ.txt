Claim
It was raised.
In the afternoon of the Yongsan War Memorial Hall
As a panelist at the 2nd KW Naji Forum
After attending and elected Trump,
Jade is discussed in North Korea's provocation
To strengthen our suppression power
More to the nuclear capacity to reinforce nuclear capabilities
It is necessary to make a chance to approach
I told you that the USFK

Withdrawal also did not discuss with the Secretary of Defense
It can be decided
I was concerned
