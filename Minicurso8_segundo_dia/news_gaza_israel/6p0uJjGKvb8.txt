ISRAEL ACTING IN A VERY
TARGETED, KAGCALIBRATED WAY, NOT
THE RENEWAL OF BIG MILITARY
OPERATIONS.
>> JOE, WE'RE JUST GETTING SOME
BREAKING NEWS INTO US AS WE
DISCUSS THIS, WHICH IS THE IDF
RELEASING ITS REPORT ON WHAT
EXACTLY HAPPENED WHEN SEVEN
PEOPLE WERE KILLED WORKING WITH
WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN IN THAT
THREE-VEHICLE CONVOY A FEW DAYS
AGO.
I'M JUST READING SOME PIECES OF
IT.
IT'S A LENGTHY REPORT.
THE INVESTIGATION'S FINDINGS
INDICATE THE INCIDENT SHOULD NOT
HAVE OCCURRED.
THOSE WHO APPROVED THE STRIKE
WERE CONVINCED THEY WERE
TARGETED ARMED OPERATIVES AND
NOT WORLD CENTRAL EMPLOYEES.
THE STRIKE IS A GRAVE MISTAKE,
STEMMING FROM A SERIOUS FAILURE,
DUE TO MISTAKE IN
IDENTIFICATION, ERRORS IN
DECISION MAKING AND AN ATTACK
CONTRARY TO THE STANDARD
OPERATING PROCEDURES.
A COUPLE OF THE COMMANDERS HAVE
BEEN DISMISSED FROM THEIR
POSITIONS.
SEVERAL OTHERS HAVE BEEN
FORMALLY REPRIMANDED.
IN THIS REPORT, ANYWAY, JOE, IDF
TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY
SAYING IT WAS A GRAVE MISTAKE.
THE FULL REPORT IS AVAILABLE
NOW.
IT WAS JUST POSTED.
PEOPLE CAN READ THROUGH IT, DRAW
THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS.
THEY SAY THEY THOUGHT THERE WERE
HAMAS TERRORISTS INSIDES
WAREHOUSE.
THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULDHAD GOTTE
INTO SOME OF THOSE TRUCKS AND
WERE MOVING THROUGH GAZA.
TRAGICALLY MISTAKEN ABOUT THAT.
THEY PROMISED A REPORT.
IT'S OUT.
IT'S POSTED NOW.
THE IDF CALLING IT A GRAVE
MISTAKE
MISTAKE, AND AGAIN, A COUPLE OF
COMMANDERS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED
FROM THEIR POSITIONS AND A FEW
OTHERS HAVE BEEN FORMALLY
REPRIMANDED BY THE MILITARY.
>> WE'LL BE OF COURSE AWAITING
THE RESPONSE FROM CHEF JOSE
ANDRES, AND, YOU KNOW, RICHARD,
TRAGIC MISTAKES HAPPEN IN WAR.
THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE
TRAGIC MISTAKES IN EVERY WAR.
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" TRIES
TO PUT THIS DOWN TO A ONE-OFF,
SUGGESTS THAT JOE BIDEN WAS
USING THIS ONE INCIDENT, THIS
ONE TRAGEDY TO GO AFTER ISRAEL.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
THIS IS THE END OF A LONG LINE
