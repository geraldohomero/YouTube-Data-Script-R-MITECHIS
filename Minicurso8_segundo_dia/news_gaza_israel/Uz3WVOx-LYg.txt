it's been two decades since ariel sharon
entered the alexa compound
the site of a right-wing israeli
politician in the third holy site of
islam sparked a major palestinian
uprising
and when it ended five years later
around a thousand israelis had been
killed while palestinians were left with
more than three thousand dead
and a separation war
nidalnagne turkmen spent 17 years in an
israeli prison
for his role in the second intifada he
says for palestinians the situation now
is even bleaker
the political horizon is shutting down
there is a regional arab international
and israeli political blockade to
pressure the palestinian leadership to
give up the rights of palestinians to
exist with their occupation and for the
issue to be economic not political the
leader of the palestinian group islamic
jihad basa mal sadi says his group may
take matters into their own
hands we expect another mass uprising or
intifada to happen at any moment for a
specific period of time this will not
stop as long as there is occupation as
long as there is a daily pressure on
these people and a continuous targeting
of their land and holy sites
since the second intifada ended in 2005
life for palestinians has gradually
become worse in the 15 years since many
jewish settlers have followed charon to
enter the alexa compound under police
escort israel has also built new
settlements along the occupy west bank
with talks of further annexation
becoming louder but none of this has led
to another uprising and despite what
some palestinian leaders may expect
neither does there seem to be one
anytime soon israeli journalist dion
levy says palestinians mostly have
themselves to blame
they have never been
so divided so much lacking leadership so
much lacking spirit of struggle
so much
isolated and neglected by the world
the west had lost interest the arab
world is betraying them as usual
and i think this is one of the worst
hours ever
still bleeding from the second intifada
that from this weakness and uprising
will
evoke we need to weigh another
generation i am afraid
but with memories of the second intifada
still fresh people in jerusalem and the
occupied west bank remain on edge
it could take just one act of
provocation for the situation to erupt
muslim world occupied is jerusalem
