this used to be the home of the riyadh
ishkantana family
before israeli airstrikes destroyed it
and left them for dead on sunday
lying in hospital
his only surviving child eshkuntana
explains how it happened
while i was sitting an israeli rocket
hit my living room it became dark i
cried
where are the children while their
mother was gathering them
the wall fell on me and i was lying on
the ground
the whole ceiling collapsed i was stuck
for five hours
i only said god help me
i was asking god to quicken my death
is his son zen was alive and speaking to
him for nearly an hour under the debris
before the child finally went silent zen
passed away half an hour later
his father walked to the sounds of
debris being moved and was pulled out
alive for the six-year-old daughter
susie
it took rescuers several more hours to
dig out the bodies of ishkantana's wife
and his four other children
grieving family members brought them
home for the funeral before escorting
the bodies to gaza's main cemetery
the ishmantanas were not the only ones
killed in sunday's air raids 42 people
including 10 children died after their
homes were hit by israeli rockets and
bombs
locals say this has now become a daily
nightmare for them
the palestinian president has always
called on the israeli to make peace and
live with us in two states
now israel is conducting airstrikes with
f-35 fighters
arabs are called terrorists
why the settlers can move smoothly into
alcots
we're only defending our rights our holy
al-aqsa mosque and our sea which is our
source of living
as the cost of innocent lives grows
israel has refused to relent and
continues to pound gaza
