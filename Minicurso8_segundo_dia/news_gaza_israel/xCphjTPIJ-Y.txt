CONFIRMING THE DEATH OF A
CANADIAN TODAY IN AN EXPLOSION
IN JERUSALEM.
TWO BOMBS WERE DETONATED, ONE AT
A BUS STATION AND A SECOND 30
MINUTES LATER AT A BUS STOP.
SEVERAL NEWS OUTLETS SAY THE
VICTIM, A TEENAGE BOY, DIED
AFTER BEING TAKEN HOSPITAL.
AT LEAST 18 OTHER PEOPLE WERE
WOUNDED.
ISRAELI AUTHORITIES ARE BLAMING
THE ATTACK ON PALESTINIAN
MILITANTS.
ON TWITTER, JUSTIN TRUDEAU
WRITES, INCREDIBLY SADDENED TO
WRITE ABOUT THE DEATH -- LEARN
ABOUT THE DEATH OF YOUNG
CANADIAN IN A TERRORIST ATTACK
IN JERUSALEM.
I'M SENDING HIS FAMILY AND
FRIENDS MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES.
I AM ALSO THINKING OF THOSE WHO
WERE INJURED.
CANADA CONDEMNS THIS VIOLENCE IN
THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS.
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN
ENTRANCES INTO THE CITY OF
JERUSALEM.
YOU CAN SEE THIS BUS STOP,
POLICE ARE STILL GATHERING UP
PIECES OF EVIDENCE.
YOU CAN SEE WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE
BEEN THE BLAST SITE, WHERE THE
FENCE AND ROCKS AROUND THE ROLE
HAVE BEEN BROKEN THROUGH.
POLICE BELIEVE A PACKAGE OF SOME
KIND WAS PLACED HERE AT THE BUS
STOP AT AROUND 7:00 A.M.
IT WAS DETONATED LIKELY
REMOTELY.
JUST 30 MINUTES LATER, ANOTHER
ATTACK TOOK PLACE DOWN THE
STREET FROM HERE, ANOTHER
PACKAGE THAT POLICE BELIEVE WAS
DETONATED REMOTELY.
POLICE ARE CALLING THIS A
COORDINATED TERROR ATTACK, THE
LIKES OF WITH JERUSALEM HAS NOT
SEEN IN YEARS.
EXPLOSIONS LIKE THESE, THESE
WERE COMMON.
BUT ISRAEL AND JERUSALEM HAS NOT
SEEN THESE PACKAGE BOMBS BEING
PLACED IN SEVERAL YEARS.
THIS IS -- THIS HAS BEEN THE
DEADLIEST YEAR FOR BOTH ISRAELIS
AND PALESTINIANS SINCE 2015.
ISRAELIS HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE
IN THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS
TARGETING ISRAELIS, STABBING
ATTACKS, RANDOM SHOOTINGS.
HIGH NUMBER OF PALESTINIANS HAVE
BEEN KILLED IN THE WEST BANK.
MANY THEY SAY BY ISRAELI FORCES.
BUT THIS RIGHT HERE, THIS IS
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
FEARING WOULD BE THE ESCALATION.
THERE WAS A LOT OF DRY KINDLING
ON THE GROUND WAITING FOR SOME
SORT OF MAJOR EVENT THAT COULD
POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A THIRD --
THAT'S THE BIG FEAR.
THIS EXPLOSION, THE LIKES OF
WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE
YEARS PASS, THERE'S A MAJOR FEAR
THIS IS THE START OF SOMETHING
GREATER, O
