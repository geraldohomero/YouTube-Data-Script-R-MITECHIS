IF YOU OPEN UP AND MUCH LARGER 
WAR WITH IRAN, IT WILL INFLAME 
THE ENTIRE REGION. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
REPORTING. 
DAVID MARTIN HAS MORE FROM THE 
PENTAGON. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING 
US. 
A SENIOR OFFICIAL TELL CBS NEWS 
THAT THE U.S. WILL NOT 
PARTICIPATE IN AN ATTACK ON 
IRAN. 
THIS, AFTER HEARING KIRBY, AND 
ANSWERING OUR COLLEAGUES 
QUESTIONS, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT 
THE U.S. WILL DO IN THE CASE 
THAT ISRAEL DOES DECIDE TO 
RESPOND?>> YOU HEARD JOHN KIRBY 
TAKE A VERY HANDS ON POSITION 
WHEN IT CAME TO THE SUBJECT OF 
RETALIATION. 
THIS IS A DECISION THAT THE 
ISRAELIS ARE GOING TO MAKE ON 
THEIR OWN, AND AS YOU 
MENTIONED, U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE 
ALREADY SAID THAT STATES IS NOT 
GOING TO PARTICIPATE. 
ISRAEL HAS THE BEST AIR FORCE 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, IT CAN DO 
CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO IRAN 
WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM THE U.S. 
IRAN HAS AIR DEFENSES, ISRAEL 
HAS F-35 STEALTH FIGHTERS, 
WHICH SHOULD BE ABLE TO EVADE 
THOSE DEFENSES OR FIRE WEAPONS 
FROM OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THOSE 
DEFENSES. 
IF ISRAEL DECIDES TO GO DEEP 
INTO IRAN AND ATTACK TARGETS 
DEEP INSIDE IRAN, IT RISKS 
LOSING AIRCRAFT AND PILOTS 
WITHOUT ANY REAL CHANCE OF 
BEING ABLE TO RESCUE THEM. 
THAT'S A HIGH RISK PROPOSITION. 
IF ISRAEL DECIDES ON A -FOR-TAT 
RESPONSE  TO THE SATURDAY NIGHT 
ATTACK, YOU EXPECT THEM TO GO 
AFTER AN IRANIAN MILITARY AT 
TARGET, ASSOCIATED WITH IRANIAN 
MISSILE FORCES. 
YOU CAN'T GO AFTER EVERY 
MISSILE LAUNCHER, BUT PERHAPS 
YOU COULD GO AFTER A 
HEADQUARTERS BUILDING, OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RETALIATE 
INSIDE OF HER RUN, YOU CAN 
RETALIATE AGAINST AN IRANIAN 
FACILITY ELSEWHERE.>> WITH YOUR 
PERSPECTIVE, EXPERIENCE, AND 
WISDOM REPORTING ON THIS, 
DAVID, DO YOU SEE WHAT ISRAEL 
IS CALLING A SUCCESS? 
IS THIS A MISCALCULATION ON THE 
PART OF IRAN, OR DO YOU 
CONSIDER THAT THERE IS SOME 
SPACE TO ASSUME THAT THE 
OUTCOME OF IT WAS DELIBERATE 
FROM IRAN, TO SHOW THAT IT IS 
RESPONDING, BUT TO LEAVE THINGS 
THERE?>> I DON'T THINK IRAN 
DESERVES CREDIT FOR HAVING 
CAUSED MINIMAL DAMAGE, UNLESS 
YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM CREDIT 
FOR HAVING NEARLY HALF THEIR 
BALLISTIC MISSILES FAIL ON 
LAUNCH OR IN-FLIGHT. 
THEY WERE TRYING TO DO DAMAGE, 
THEY FIRE
