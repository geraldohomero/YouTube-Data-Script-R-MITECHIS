over a month after the Hamas attacks on
October the 7th this Cultural Center has
still not reopened the site is now being
used as a distribution center by an
organization named latet which means to
give in Hebrew it's very important for
us to take part in this mobilization
it's vital for the people we're helping
and they're not helping just anyone but
survivors of the Holocaust they do so by
delivering food and hygiene Parcels
enough to last for around a fortnite
toothpaste toothbrushes wipes deodorants
the idea is for them to be able to live
during this time of war in a kind of
self-reliance in terms of products so
they don't have to leave their
homes and we can relieve them of the

tomorrow how they going to wash
tomorrow because currently in ashalon
going out means taking risks even more

population has nowhere to take refuge in
the event of an
attack every war every war with Hamas
reminds me of what happened along time
ago our enemies leave us alone for a
moment we think we're safe and secure
then all of a sudden
boom how are we supposed to be
optimistic upon leaving Alice's District
it's clear just how much life has come
to a standstill in ashalon shops are
closed streets are PR practically
deserted Zoya aged 90 has not set foot
outside since the 7th of
October I live by the
Sea they came by
sea I try to be strong but I can't I'm
afraid to go outside because I won't be
able to reach the shelter in time I have
a nurse at home and she has to take out
my

rubbish those who were children during
the second world war know better than
anyone that it will take time for
ashan's population to recover and live
normally again
