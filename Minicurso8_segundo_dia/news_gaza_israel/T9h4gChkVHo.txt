HERE IS MEGAN FITZGERALD WITH
THE BREAKDOWN.
>> RELEASING THIS DRAMATIC
VIDEO, SHOWING THE HEAVILY ARMED
REBEL GROUP HIJACKING AND
ISRAELI LINKED SHIP IN THE RED
SEA, AND TAKING 25 CREW MEMBERS
HOSTAGE.
THEY EDITED THE VIDEO AND
BLURRED FACES WITH THE INCIDENT
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT
ESCALATING REGIONAL BATTLES WITH
ESCALATING REGIONAL BATTLES WITH
ISRAEL AND HAMAS FIGHTING.
ANOTHER GROUP, 1000 MILES TO
THE SOUTHEAST, GETTING INVOLVED.
THAT'S AN OFFICIAL FROM JAPAN,
WHICH OPERATED THE SHIP,
WHICH OPERATED THE SHIP,
TRAVELING UNDER A BAHAMIAN FLAG.
THEY ARE CALLING FOR AN EARLY
RELEASE OF THOSE HOSTAGES.
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS
SAYING THERE WERE NO ISRAELIS
ON BOARD.
A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE GROUP
PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT
ISRAELIS ONLY KNOW THE LANGUAGE
OF FORCE, ADDING THAT THIS IS
THE BEGINNING, BUT IT'S A
RESULT OF YEARS OF CONFLICT
BETWEEN GROUPS BACKED BY THE
WEST AND BY IRAN.
IN THE '80S AND '90S, THE
FAMILY IN NORTHERN YEMEN PUSHED
FOR A RELIABLE OF A SHIITE
BRANCH OF ISLAM, BUT THE
MOVEMENT ADOPTED THIS SLOGAN,
"GOD IS THE GREATEST, DEATH TO
AMERICA, DEATH TO ISRAEL, DEATH
TO THE AND DEATH TO ISLAM."
THIS IS THE CAPITAL IN 2014,
BEGINNING A WAR.
SAUDI ARABIA, BACKED BY THE
WEST, INTERVENED IN 2015.
NOW, A DECADE LATER, THE WAR
HAS KILLED MORE THAN 150,000
PEOPLE PAID
>> INITIALLY, SAUDI ARABIA'S
MOTIVE WAS TO PREVENT IRAN FROM
ESTABLISHING A BASE ON THE
SOUTHWEST OF THE PENINSULA.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT SAUDI
ARABIA DID NOT ACHIEVE THAT.
LIKE THEY ARE PART OF THIS SO-
CALLED RESISTANCE, OPPOSING THE
WEST.
>> THE INTERNATIONALLY
RECOGNIZED GOVERNMENT HAS NOT
DECLARED WAR ON ISRAEL, BUT
THEY ARE CALLING TO DEFEAT
ISRAEL IN VIDEOS LIKE THIS.
AND ALSO, RELEASING VIDEOS THAT
THEY SAY SHOW DRONES AND
MISSILE ATTACKS IN ISRAEL.
THE PENTAGON, SUGGESTING THAT
SOME MISSILES HAVE A RANGE OF
1200 MILES.
>> IT'S A MESSAGE OF SUPPORT.
THEY ARE TELLING ISRAEL AND THE
REST OF THE REGION INCLUDING
SAUDI ARABIA THAT THEY ARE IN
THIS WITH HAMAS.
>> NOW, ESCALATING WITH A SHIP
ATTACK, THREATENING GLOBAL TRADE
