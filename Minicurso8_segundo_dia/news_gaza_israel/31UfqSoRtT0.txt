So the main development politically has
been that unity government, that war
cabinet assembled by Benjamin Netanyahu.
He will preside over that.
It will include his defense minister,
but also the former defense minister and
the opposition leader, Benny Gantz.
Really the unity there in Israel and
being able to come together politically,
something that they have really
struggled to do in recent months.
And overnight, you had the Israeli
Defense Force saying that they are
carrying out extensive attacks in Gaza,
continuing to bomb.
We have had sort of relentless bombing
since Saturday.
We have another death toll now in Gaza
that exceeds, according to sources,
there are 1200 people and they don't
have food.
They don't have electricity and water.
And this all, obviously, as we see more
and more Israeli troops are massing on
the border of Gaza in anticipation of
what we can only assume will be a ground
invasion.
So what is the next milestone to watch
for here in the coming hours?
Yeah, so a 24 hours are a lot to watch
for.
So as we say, 100,000 troops are on the
border.
They have conscripted.
They've brought out of the reserves more
than 300,000 soldiers.
And really with the stated intention of
destroying Hamas, initially it was just
to try to neutralize their military
capabilities.
That is really that rhetoric has gotten
a lot stronger recently and that is
complicated, obviously, by the number of
civilians and the dense population of
Gaza.
The hostages, an unknown number still of
Israelis that are still under their
control, their equipment, will it be
overstretched and of course, the
northern border with Lebanon, if they
move into Gaza, could you see Hezbollah
acting more?
