makes his way carefully through the
wreckage of his home
there used to be two buildings here five
floors each 35 flats the residents
became homeless in the blink of an eye
on the morning of may 16th israeli
planes dropped bombs raising the
buildings to the ground they destroyed
my dreams and the future i was planning
for myself and my children
this isn't the first time allah has been
displaced due to israeli aggression
in the 2014 war i lost my home along
with my family's building in the shujaya
district near the border the building
had four floors 30 of us lived there we
had nowhere to go
i looked for a house in central gaza
away from the border seeking some
security i bought a flat in this
building
but now it too has been raised to the
ground
and i'm
risk follows us wherever we go
once again i have to start from scratch
to look for a home for my family in a
place that's considered safe so this
doesn't happen for a third time
allah recalls the terrifying moment they
were ordered to evacuate
the israeli officer only gave us three
minutes to leave the building it was
short notice first the building was hit
with reckon missiles then it was raised
it's shocking when your dreams are
destroyed in front of your eyes
despite the hardship and suffering la is
determined to make a life for himself
and his family
there is still hope for happiness we
will live a happy life if the occupation
leaves us alone
no place is safe when the occupation is
bombing the east the west everywhere our
hearts are full of sorrow but despite
that we will rebuild and life will
return
surrounded by the destruction of the
latest attacks although allah vows to
rebuild
he says it'll be impossible to forget
his people's pain
