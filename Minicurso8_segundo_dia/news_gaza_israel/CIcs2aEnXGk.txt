Today at the beginning of the program we talk
of a truce that quite possibly and if
God wants to be implemented from
Tomorrow between Israel and never mediated by
Qatar and Egypt and with the
participation of the United States but
This does not happen between Israel and Lebanon
Not eh s the attacks of Hisbol and Israel
Of course Hisbol and the terrorist group
They are never allies are partners in this
War this is not happening now in
Lebanon to have a kind of
background the last time there was a
Armed conflict here was in 2006
The figures were much lower than
that there is now in relation to dead and
injured but the main fear is that
different Arab countries and different
Arab armies can join for
fighting Israel that is the fear that
Today is Israel these images that
We are seeing are precisely the
Attacks that Hisbol perpetrated in Lebanon
against Israeli forces for that
We see these inscriptions in Arabic
also not many times is it
usual imos for this part of the world
For the West see the images of
Israel well now we show you what
It is recorded on the other side of the border
When talking about a war
At the regional level one says good can
get to happen and it can be transformed
In a regional war I already say the
We have because Israel turns around for
here and has the conflict with ever looks
to the other side and is in full
Battle with Hisbol yesterday we shared here
almost what cinematographic images of
How huy a group of Yemenis caught
The hutis caught an Israel ship
I say we are already talking about a conflict
regional is not formalized not
is bleached if you want but yes
because if we think about it in terms of
United States geopolitical support and
Europe support Israel and on the other side
Iran is an Arabic military power
support both JOLA and the group never with
Which as one deepens no
In those good networks that is a bit
more in evidence that is pointing
The trend goes to a war of
much greater conflict what today is a
concern and could increase
Dead figures that in Lebanon to
Less already exceed 70 people thanks
Nel and war we continue
speaking in a while in first news
