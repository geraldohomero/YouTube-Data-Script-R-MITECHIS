palestinian territories after the
israeli forces while carrying out a raid
are said to have shot dead a palestinian
teenager in the occupied west bank

his neck and also in the back in a town
near bethlehem by the israeli forces

responded to what it claims was live
fire
only when a number of suspects had
hurled rocks and also petrol bombs at
the israeli soldiers adding that the
soldiers were conducting what they
described as a routine security activity
via this raid in the area
now the incident has been put under
review by the israeli military itself it
is not clear whether the victim had
participated in the clashes
meanwhile the palestinian health
ministry has said that the killing of
this palestinian teenager which is yet
another killing
is a part of a series of crimes
committed by the israeli forces

israelis of carrying out field
executions on a regular basis

gun fire on even teenagers

eight of the casualties that the
palestinians have suffered at the hands
of the israeli troops
