well for more we can cross now to
jerusalem to speak with our
correspondent iris mackle
iris what's the latest on the ground
this thursday morning
well what is significant on the ground
this thursday morning is something that
is absent and that's a ceasefire
egypt did propose a ceasefire to start
at six a.m local time today
that's uh three hours ago and we do not
see
a ceasefire yet we see in fact more of
the same
that is to say airstrikes israeli
airstrikes in the gaza strip and
um palestinian rocket fire militant
rocket fire back
into southern israel there seems to be
some
kind of a deal that has been done
between hamas and israel
which says israel will not target
multi-story buildings if
hamas does not target uh the central
towns that is tel aviv that
that area of israel and we have seen
that over the past couple of days
and that may be a precursor to a
ceasefire because
ceasefires here aren't a big
announcement and everybody lays down
their arms things just kind of peter out
with understandings behind the scene but
at the moment
it is a situation as normal
and there is a germany's foreign
minister is arriving in israel of this
thursday
where exactly are we with the diplomatic
efforts
to bring about a ceasefire here the
diplomatic efforts are the only thing
that are
leading towards a ceasefire if it were
up to the parties on the ground this
would continue
so yesterday we saw um huge american
pressure
the secretary of state called the um
israeli foreign minister the u.s defense
secretary called israel's defense
minister
president biden called israel's prime
minister
and i know that israel's prime minister
made a statement afterwards saying we're
going ahead it doesn't matter what but
you can see that the drip drip drip
of this is powerful we are seeing the
german foreign minister arriving today
we've seen um efforts from
other european leaders including france
of course
and i think all of that is we we are
seeing because we've heard from a hamas
official
not in gaza in the gulf but he said it
will be
24 to 48 hours and i think i think his
assessment is right
uh because we're here at seeing all
these leaks from israeli defense
officials too
everybody pointing in the same direction
which is slower or quicker
it's in the ceasefire track now iris
mclaren in jerusalem thank you very much
