a chinese-born canadian who's allegedly
one of the world's most notorious drug
lords
is under arrest tonight taken into
custody by dutch police
as he tried to board a plane bound for
canada as ctv's angie seth reports the
man dubbed asia's el chapo
is accused of running a sprawling
multi-billion dollar
global criminal empire he's one of the
world's most wanted men
si chi lap a suspected drug kingpin
born in china and also a canadian
citizen
and he was about to board a plane to
canada when police arrested him
at amsterdam's airport
the 56-year-old allegedly runs a vast
drug syndicate
that its members refer to as simply the
company
it dominates asia's multi-billion dollar
drug trade
funneling meth and heroin into at least
a dozen countries
so it is a multinational organization in
terms of
this type of investigation time
consuming
very difficult to put the pieces
together the scale of it earned him a
nickname
asia's el chapo although unlike the
mexican drug lord who's a pop culture
figure
relatively little is known about the
elusive and shadowy sea
but just like el chapo c has been in u.s
custody in 1998 he was convicted of
trafficking drugs into america
he went to prison got out in 2006
and returned to canada the investigators
will be reaching out to the canadian
police services
there's indication that some of this
money was being cleansed if you will and
buried
in the purchase of properties next
police say he went back to asia
and back to his old ways much of the
syndicate's drugs are smuggled into
australia where police have been on
sea's tail now for years they now plan
to seek his extradition from the
netherlands
