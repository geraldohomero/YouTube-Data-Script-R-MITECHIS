Borja: There is another scene
Moving in the middle of horror
Of this war, is that of a
Father protecting his daughter from
The bombings.
This video they are watching
Has turned viral in networks
SOCIAL.
Carolina: a video that
Affects each of the
People who have had the
Opportunity to see it.
 We connect to Tel Aviv.
Just here in the "edition
Digital "we connect live
Until Tel Aviv with Isan
Matalov,
The father is beautiful girl from
Just years.
 Alma, welcome to the "edition
Digital ", I am a mother, and seeing
Those images split my soul,
But also the courage that
Had, and his reaction so fast
To hide with his girl.
Has had the opportunity to see
The images, at that time
What happened for his head, ideal?
>> At this time when
I was with my daughter, I just thought
That I need to be calm
FOR HER.
I didn't want her to go
Cry, I don't know, atmosphere of
Panic, I wanted to be more
Quiet with her.
Borja: What does one or what
You are not willing to make one
To save your daughter's life,
IN THIS CASE?
You are very accustomed
Unfortunately in Israel,
Where you live, in Tel Aviv,
But unfortunately this time
It seems that this different one, put
That Israel has declared the
STATE OF WAR.
How are the
City, in Tel Aviv, also in
THE COUNTRY?
What does the press say,
What do people say in
THE STREET?
>> For me, the most days
Difficult and sad that had
In my life, because I could not
Imagine that we are going to have this
Situation in Israel.
We have very strong army,
But we cannot understand how
So many terrorists came to
Cities in Israel, killed,
They kidnapped, more women,
Children killed.
 My head is not, I can't
Understand that, I can't think
ABOUT IT.
Carolina: You are dad
Right now, you have considered perhaps
Leave
United States if possible or
To another part of the world,
Considering that they are in
WAR?
>> I can't think about leaving
MY COUNTRY.
Right now we are united more
NEVER,
 Many people are in the
Army now also people
That is no longer an obligation to
They donate time, and
Fight, and now more than ever
We have to be united in
ISRAEL.
Borja: We thank you very much
You have been with us here
To explain your
Feel after images
They have become viral.TEA
We want a lot of success and encouragement.
