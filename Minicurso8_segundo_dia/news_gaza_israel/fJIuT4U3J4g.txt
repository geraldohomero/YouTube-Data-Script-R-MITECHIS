BLOODSHED AND NOW WE'LL HEAR
FROM THE SECRETARY.
>> TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
>> THESE TWO AMERICANS ARE NOW
SAFELY IN THE HANDS OF ISRAELI
AUTHORITIES IN ISRAEL.
WE EXPECT A TEAM FROM THE U.S.
EMBASSY TO SEE THEM VERY SHORTLY
OVER THE COMING HOURS, THEY'LL
RECEIVE ANY SUPPORT AND
ASSISTANCE THEY NEED, AND OF
COURSE, WE'RE VERY ANXIOUS TO BE
ABLE TO REUNITE THEM WITH THEIR
LOVED ONES.
WE WELCOME THEIR RELEASE.
WE SHARE IN THE RELIEF THAT
THEIR FAMILIES, FRIENDS, AND
LOVED ONES ARE FEELING.
BUT THERE ARE STILL TEN
ADDITIONAL AMERICANS WHO REMAIN
UNACCOUNTED FOR IN THIS
CONFLICT.
WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM ARE
BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS
ALONG WITH AN ESTIMATE 200 OTHER
HOSTAGES HELD IN GAZA.
THEY INCLUDE MEN, WOMEN, YOUNG
BOYS, YOUNG GIRLS, ELDERLY
PEOPLE FROM MANY NATIONS.
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM SHOULD
BE RELEASED.
SINCE THE EARLIEST HOURS OF THIS
CRISIS, THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE
CLEAR THAT HE WILL DO EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE TO SECURE THE RELEASE
OF EVERY HOSTAGE.
DURING MY OWN RECENT TRAVEL OF
THE REGION, I EMPHASIZED THE
URGENCY AND IMPORTANCE OF THIS
TO THE UNITED STATES AND PRESSED
OUR PARTNERS TO DO EVERYTHING
THEY CAN TO HELP US SECURE THE
RELEASE.
SINCE THAT TIME, WE CONTINUE TO
WORK RELENTLESSLY WITH PARTNERS
TO DO JUST THAT.
I CAN'T SPEAK PUBLICLY ABOUT THE
DETAILS OF THESE EFFORTS.
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT THE URGENT WORK TO FREE
EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, TO FREE
ALL OTHER HOSTAGES, CONTINUES.
AS DOES OUR WORK TO SECURE THE
SAFE PASSAGE OUT OF GAZA FOR THE
AMERICANS WHO ARE TRAPPED THERE.
IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE, I
WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNMENT OF
QATAR FOR THEIR VERY IMPORTANT
ASSISTANCE.
WHEN I WAS IN ISRAEL LAST WEEK,
I MET WITH THE FAMILIES OF U.S.
CITIZENS THAT HAMAS HAS TAKEN
HOSTAGE.
PRESIDENT BIDEN, TOO, HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR DIRECTLY
FROM THE FAMILIES.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ADEQUATELY
PUT INTO WORDS THE AGONY THEY'RE
FEELING OF NOT KNOWING THE FATE
OF THEIR LOVED ONES.
WORRYING RELENTLESSLY ABOUT
THEM, FOR THEIR SAFETY, FOR
THEIR SECURITY, FOR THEIR
WELL-BEING.
NO FAMILY ANYWHERE SHOULD HAVE
TO EXPERIENCE THIS TORTURE.
WHAT I SHARED WITH THE FAMILIES,
AS THE PRESIDENT DID AS WELL, IS
THAT THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT WILL WORK EVERY
MINUTE OF EVERY DAY TO SECURE
THEIR RELEASE, TO BRING THEIR
LOVED ONES HOME.
THEY HAVE MY SOLEMN PLEDGE,
