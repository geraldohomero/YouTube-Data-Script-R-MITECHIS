Gaza most newborns come from tent cities
where their families fled to to escape
Israeli bombardments their living
conditions are contributing to their
poor health doctors here say their
efforts are in vain the babies return to
the tents after receiving treatment only

incubator this child should be in an
incubator like the one over there an
incubator that is safe warm and has
medicine for a child who is a few days
old doctors should also be available to
treat him but because of the number of
children they're keeping us here so I
can take care of my son instead of him

incubator gaza's Health Care system is
