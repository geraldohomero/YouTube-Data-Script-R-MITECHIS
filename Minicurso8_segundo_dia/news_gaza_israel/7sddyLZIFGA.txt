Three places have reported the media
premises that a hospital has been built

north of Sinai in total there would be
Availability of the injured
Palestinians 350 beds but as well
You have commented only 80 of the most
Serious would be dating those
ambulances and reaching those centers
Inside Egypt we remember that there are more
of 20,000 wounded throughout these 23
days of bombings and more than 8000 dead

580 French French Spanish

European Belgium and also
Latin American but we are pending
to know the exact number and also
Who are the ones who would have already left
