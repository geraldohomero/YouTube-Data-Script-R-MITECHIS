The Mexican Diana Guerrero Juncal
registered from the first minute in the
Relations Secretariat System
exteriors for those who asked to be
rescued from the conflict zone in
Israel but the Foreign Ministry replied
what should wait and fear that your
family is an object of an attack
armed while rowing for help made
that asks for help in social networks and
Well we are waiting to see if we can
get on to
I can't go to the airport in
This moment since it is very dangerous
The authorities have also told me that
I stayed here until I have
a response from them since
My situation is a bit vulnerable
Veracruz that has been found for
years in Israel lived near the
Border where on Saturday, October 7
The first rockets fueled fell
From Gaza when listening to the rumble
He had to flee accompanied by his two
children and her husband and forgot documents
vital as identifications and
passports of his family my house was
very close
From a city in which they arrived
The terrorists I heard everything from me
house and literal I ran from there with
My children I grabbed only diapers
And then what I could and forgot my
Passports Diana Guerrero reported that
although he already made communication
They asked to wait because it does not have
documents or means of transport
insurance to get to the airport by
that trying to get to terminal would be
dangerous for her and her family hours
Later the woman commented on another
publication that for the second time the
Mexico Embassy in Israel contacted her
But neither did it give him good news and
They told him that only a plane would go
More to Israel made by which she assumes
that there is a low probability of returning
to
home
