Several leaders spoke to
regarding what is happening in
Middle East we continue to deepen
information just what happens
in the Gaza Strip because as
You said you throughout these days
There were many leaders throughout the
Eh that have manifested not
particularly
Pro Israel or Pro Palestine eh prose cessation
to the fire is the position they are
showing several conference
Press in British Columbia where the
Canada Prime Minister Just Trud
declared that wars have rules and
called Israel to exercise maxim
containment in their fighting in the strip
from gaza the price of
Justice cannot be the continuous
suffering of all civilians
Palestinians was what Trudo said
the rules
there are to comply with them in this regard
All innocent lives have the
same value Israelis and
Palestinas the world is looking
We listen to doctors's testimonies
Surviving relatives who have
lost to his parents was what he said
Canadian president who too
He added that the world is seeing this
death of the women of the children of
Babies and that this must end
Logically, how has it happened in others
instances this type of statements
They raised the reaction of the first
Minister
Israeli
who criticized the Canadian couple something that
It is becoming usual not president
that makes some type of criticism or
Even the Israeli government but to
war and violence with which
They are unleashing the attacks receiving
quickly a criticism by the
Israeli leader is not Israel who is
deliberately attacking civilians
but it was never what Nahu replied
who also added that it was never the one
decapitated burned and massacred civilians in the
worse horror perpetrated against Jews
From the holocaust was what he wrote
In the social network the strength of the
Civilization must support Israel
To defeat the ever barbarism
The president ended
Israel
Ah
