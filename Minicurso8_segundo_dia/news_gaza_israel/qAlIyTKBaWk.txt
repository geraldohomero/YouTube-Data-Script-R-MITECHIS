So the frequent between Israel and Palestine
After increasing dispute and that dispute escalation
Now here inside the city of Ahmedabad
Protests are also taking place in Gujarat
And especially people inside Israel's support
We have descended here in Paldi area
There are many people of Ahmedabad where you
You can see that the force is older
Come here and V stand with Israel
These here during posters here
Small children are also mothers
Sisters are also all the people have reached here and
Everyone is trying to give a message
India is constantly difficult with Israel
You have stood in time that you know that
After Hamas was a terrorist attack
International landscape in constant change
Going and now Israel is also reversing
But the pictures that are coming out
She says what Surti here after that
There is a situation and there is opposition inside Gujarat
The person who is associated with us himself is complete
Stand with Israel's performance here
We will talk to them, Sir, tell your name
First my name is Mukesh Tank is Mukesh ji
What is the reason that stand with Israel
Take you a single performance here today
Yes, they have come in support
Innocent citizens of Israel
The attack by a terrorist group named Hamas
He is wrong that terrorists are wrong
Should be destroyed and those people innocent
Women stripped on it
Putting feet and did some religious excitement and religion
Also maligned and its sympathy
And all the citizens who are dead
God is praying that God
Let us pay salvation, so we have kept this program
And which country of these terrorist tendencies
We live together to expose those people
Want and we have terrorism all over the world
We have to erase everyone together
Will have to talk to us very much
To do it here
This is coming out and this V stand with
Israel who is installed here and with
Only those who are in support of it
He clearly spoke that time
It has come to respond to terrorism and
Now that is the time that this world bear this thing
Can't do the video with the signs
