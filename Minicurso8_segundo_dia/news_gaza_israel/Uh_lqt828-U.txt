now those who have already been
vaccinated the announcement
by a prime minister naftali bennett
makes israel the first country to offer
a third dose of a western vaccine to its
citizens
on a wide scale the west asian country
had launched one of the world's most
successful vaccination drives
earlier this year the decision comes at
a time of rising infections and signs
that the vaccine's efficacy dwindles
over time
the jobs will begin this weekend as a
part of a complimentary vaccination
campaign
for people aged over 60 who were fully
vaccinated more than five months ago
israeli president isaac herzog will
receive booster
shots on friday
i'm announcing this evening the
beginning of the campaign to receive the
booster shot
the third vaccine at this stage the
vaccine will be given to 60 year olds
and over
five months after they've received the
second shot reality proves the vaccines
are safe
reality also proves the vaccines protect
from severe morbidity and death and like
the flu vaccines that need to be renewed
from time to time
it is the same in this case
neither the us nor the eu have approved
coronavirus booster shots
it is not yet proven if a third dose
helps and if so
who needs one and when previously
boosters were used in some countries
with the chinese and russian vaccines
now earlier this year israel carried out
one of the world's most aggressive and
successful
vaccination campaigns over 57 percent of
the country's 9.3 million citizens have
received two doses of the fisa bio in
tech vaccine
and over 80 of the population over 40
is vaccinated the vaccination program
allowed israel to reopen its economy
ahead of other countries
but there are signs that the vaccine's
efficacy wears off
over time and israel has seen a spike in
cases of the new delta variant
even among people who are vaccinated
israel has recorded more than 1
400 covet 19 cases in 24 hours
more than 15 000 active cases are
currently identified
including 151 people hospitalized
in a serious condition last month health
officials announced that they would open
up vaccination to children as young as
12.

aged 5 to 11
are at risk of serious health
complications that could be vaccinated
