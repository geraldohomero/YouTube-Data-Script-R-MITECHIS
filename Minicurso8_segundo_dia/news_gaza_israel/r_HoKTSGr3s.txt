eh the day after it is clear that it is
remote and in the last hours I know something
It clashes in the statements is the
threat in some way that has
Translated the Foreign Minister
Iranian to Qatar saying that expansion
of the problem it is inevitable that the guilt
is from Israel for that intensification of
The aggressions huh believe that eh despite that
intensification
Diplomatic is that escalation possible
We have seen Israel eh bombing and
pointing out that you will bombard sites in
Syria as you continue receiving attacks
The country will take responsibility for that area
I will raise the tone believes that fear
of the climbing has not yet dissipated that
It takes more weight that fear always
has always been there it is that
As we move away from the date
fateful of October 7 huh the risk
climbing is decreasing huh for another
side Iran is taking that prominence
Diplomatic huh that has always
wanted to have not in relation to the
Defense of the Gazatí is also
who can more easily climb the
conflict because it is more represented
In in the border areas such as
Lebanon's case the case of Syria with
With those armed arms of
Hizbulá huh and therefore well yes
Someone has to do these
statements is Iran eh of
Diplomatic language of language eh
The EH halls and the press conferences
What are the facts huh there is a
considerable distance and we have come
Seeing in the last weeks where they will go
You have used a language huh much more
aggressive in diplomatic sources of what
that then have been the facts and
as time is progressing more because the
The climb decreases of course everything
can change of course it will depend
Much of Israel's plans is going to
depending a lot on how Israel eh leads to
that occupation that segregation
ever of the Gazatí people eh is going to
depend a lot on all these
factors but eh well will go what
wants to demonstrate with these statements
and with others that have been doing in the
Last weeks is that it is very
pending what happens and that has
assumed the key to be able to activate a
Scaling in the conflict
