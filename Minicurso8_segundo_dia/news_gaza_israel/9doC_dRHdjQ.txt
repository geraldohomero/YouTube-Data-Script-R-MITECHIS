D
WHEN HE OPENED FIRE AT A GROCERY
STORE IN A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK
NEIGHBOURHOOD IN BUFFALO.
THE BUREAU CHIEF JOY MALBON IS
COVERING THE STORY FOR US.
IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL DAY IN COURT
TODAY, TELL US MORE ABOUT WHAT
COURT HEARD FROM THE VICTIM
IMPACT STATEMENT.
>> Reporter: THIS WAS WROUGHT
PAIN, AN INCREDIBLE, POWERFUL
MOMENT FROM FAMILIES WHO LOST
LOVED ONES AT THE HANDS OF SELF
RADICALIZED WHITE SUPREMACISTS
WHO TARGETED BLACK PEOPLE, WHO
PURPOSELY DROVE HOURS TO A BLACK
SUPERMARKET TO KILL BLACK
PEOPLE.
TO START SOME KIND OF A RACE
WAR.
ONE WOMAN WHO STANDS OUT TO ME
WAS KATHERINE MASSEY WHO LOST
HER SISTER AND SHE WAS SO FILLED
WITH ANGER AND PAIN AND SHE WAS
SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO PAYTON
GENDRON AND SAID, I WANT TO
CHOKE YOU.
SHE WAS SO ANGRY AND THEN WHAT
HAPPENED IS ANOTHER FAMILY
MEMBER LUNGED AT PEYTON, IT WAS
QUITE THE INCREDIBLE AND
EMOTIONAL SCENE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND WHY.
I WOULD NEVER GO INTO A
COMMUNITY AND PURPOSELY TARGET
BLACK PEOPLE, WHY WOULD YOU DO
THAT?
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS
AND EVEN THOUGH PAYTON GENDRON
WHO IS NOW 19 YEARS OLD WHO
CRIED AND SEEMS REMORSEFUL AND
APOLOGIZED AND SAID HE WAS WRONG
, IT WILL NEVER BRING BACK
THEIR LOVED ONES AND YOU JUST
FELT THAT ANGUISH TODAY.
>> Lois: FROM WHAT I
UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT THE ONLY
SENTENCE HE IS FACING.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.
ALTHOUGH THE JUDGE AND LAWYERS
AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
LOOKED, HE WILL SUFFER AND SPEND
THE REST OF HIS LIFE BEHIND BARS
WITH NO CHANCE OF PAROLE,
CHARGED WITH A HATE CRIME, HE
WILL FACE THOSE FEDERAL CHARGES
AND HE COULD ACTUALLY FACE THE
DEATH PENALTY.
SOME LAWYERS THOUGHT THAT WHAT
HE WAS SAYING TODAY BY PLEADING
GUILTY AND APOLOGIZING IN A WAY
SO THAT HE CAN AVOID THE DEATH
PENALTY BUT EVERYBODY TODAY SAID
THERE HAS TO BE A LARGER
CONVERSATION IN THIS COUNTRY
ABOUT GUNS AND ABOUT RACISM AND
DISCRIMINATIO
