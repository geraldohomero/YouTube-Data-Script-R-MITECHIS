the latest earlier this week as the
security Council met on Gaza Algeria the
current Arab member of the council
circulated a new draft resolution which
would again call for an immediate
ceasefire but the US ambassador Linda
Thomas Greenfield says this is very
unhelpful to the ongoing delicate
negotiations this draft resolution could
put sensitive negotiations in Jeopardy
derailing the exhaustive ongoing
diplomatic efforts to secure the release
of hostages and secure an extended pause
that Palestinian civilians and Aid
workers so desperately need so the US
ambassador says she's opposed to the
timing of the new draft resolution but
of course her countryes been opposed to
the idea of a Ceasar for nearly 4 months
a un Security Council resolution
demanding a cisa would have been passed
already if the US hadn't used its veto
