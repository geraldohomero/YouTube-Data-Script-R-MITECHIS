US Vice President Kamala Harris 
called out Israel on Sunday for  
not doing enough to ease a "humanitarian 
catastrophe" in Gaza in what appeared  
to be the sharpest rebuke yet by a 
senior leader in the US government.
“People in Gaza are starving. 
The conditions are inhumane,  
and our common humanity compels us to act.”
“...and the Israeli government must do more to  
significantly increase the 
flow of aid. No excuses.”
Speaking in Alabama, Harris said Israel 
must open new border crossings and not  
impose "unnecessary restrictions" on aid delivery.
She also called for an 
immediate ceasefire in Gaza,  
and urged Hamas to accept a deal to release 
hostages in return for a pause in fighting.
KAMALA HARRIS: “And given the immense scale of 
suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate  
ceasefire for at least the next six weeks, 
which is what is currently on the table.”
The comments come after an aid 
delivery disaster last week near  
Gaza City in which 115 people were killed, 
according to Gaza health authorities.
They attribute the deaths to Israeli forces who  
they say fired on Palestinians as they 
rushed towards aid delivery trucks.
Israel disputed the death toll figure, and 
said most victims were trampled or run over.
Harris’ comments reflect intense 
frustration, if not desperation,  
within the US government about the 
war, which has hurt President Joe  
Biden with left-leaning voters as 
he seeks re-election this year.
Harris is scheduled to meet with Israeli 
war cabinet member Benny Gantz on Monday  
at the White House, where she is expected 
to deliver a similarly direct message.
