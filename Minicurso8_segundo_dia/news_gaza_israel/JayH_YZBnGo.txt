One of our upstairs bedrooms and I'm looking out on the Grand mesa,
you can see it.
The view from her home in Grand Junction is quiet. It's quiet here.
A stark contrast compared to last month, drones overhead all day, never stopping.
And then you would see airplane,
an airplane overhead just meant there was gonna be be a bomb drop in a few minutes.
And so we heard bomb drops. Dr Barb
Zend is a pediatrician.
She's been on several mission trips, helping families in other countries.
This was her 10th visit to Gaza.
Were you able to complete your mission when you were there in Gaza?
Not in Gaza.
Um because I arrived there on Friday and then on Saturday,
the war started her new mission,
get home safely.
A few days later,
Doctor Zen joined a convoy where everyone had that same
goal in mind and we had phone mattresses and um
slept there on that floor. That was one location
and this was another, we slept outside. We were kind of in a little uh parking lot.
So I had a foam mattress and a wool blanket and we,
we could some people slept in the car and some people slept outside.
I both throughout the couple weeks,
Doctor Zen spent weeks fighting to get back home to her family.
I was in Cairo about 24 hours and then 130 the next morning, um, flew,
ended up flying to Denver and where her family was waiting with open arms.
You know, it's relief. Right.
If you're glad you're home, it's, it's also feeling bad for all the people that you,
that can't escape, they can't get out
and so mixed feelings.
I would say her family now able to plan for the holidays,
knowing doctors in will be joining them at the table.
There was a time when people were saying,
I don't know if we'll be out by Thanksgiving, Brianna Clark nine News.
Doctor Zen would love to go back to Gaza to continue her original mission.
But she says that's gonna be a conversation
with her family before she makes any decision
just because this was really scary for them while she was there.
