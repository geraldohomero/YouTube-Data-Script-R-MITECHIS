>> Reporter:  HI. 
THE ISRAELI MILITARY HAS JUST 
FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS INDEED 
DEAD, OR KILLED DURING THE 
EVENTS OF OCTOBER 7th. 
THAT HORRIFIC HAMAS MASSACRE.  
THIS APPROXIMATELY KILLED A 
2700 PEOPLE, AND LED TO 
HUNDREDS OF HOSTAGES BEING 
TAKEN INTO HAMAS TERRITORY.  
THEY WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION 
THAT HE WAS ALIVE. 
THEY FOUND OUT THE ONLY THING 
HE TOOK HOSTAGE WAS HIS BODY. 
HE WAS 19 YEARS OLD. 
PART OF A TANK DIVISION ON THAT 
MORNING. 
ALSO, NOTEWORTHY, OR HIS 
PARENTS. 
THEY WERE AMONG THE MOST 
OUTSPOKEN FAMILY MEMBERS, 
RAISING AWARENESS OF THESE 
HOSTAGES. 
OFTEN TIMES FOR THEM, IT SEEMED 
LIKE THEY WERE GETTING LOST IN 
THE FOG OF WAR. 
THEY MET WITH WORLD LEADERS, 
INCLUDING PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.  
THIS IS WHY PRESIDENT JOE 
BIDEN,  WAS SO MOVED, AND SO 
QUICK TO EXPRESS HIS 
CONDOLENCES, AND ALSO TO 
REAFFIRM HIS COMMITMENT TO THE 
HOSTAGES. 
AND, TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF 
THEM. 
AS YOU MENTIONED, THERE ARE 
SEVERAL AMERICANS THAT ARE 
STILL HELD IN HAMAS  CAPTIVITY. 
IT IS UNKNOWN HOW MANY
