I instantly told them to continue
the worldwide debate by the
Artificial intelligence The truth is that
The debate for the
facial recognition programs a
Very important medium from the United States
New York Times denounced that Israel already
is using an experimental program
of these characteristics to locate
Reenes and identify terrorists in the
Gaza Strip initially this
Surveillance program that I repeat is
experimental began as a form of
Find Israeli hostages in the strip of
Gaza However, with the passage of time
And of the months the initiative was extended
quickly to identify
Anyone who had links with
Never or with other groups and there would be
I identified civilians
Palestinians as if they had links with
I never agree with the source
since this media spoke with officials
of Israeli intelligence that revealed
that when it seems to be the forces of this
country would be using this type of
Systems in the Gaza Strip
USA TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM PROGRAM
Private Israeli consists to recognize
people with less than half of their
exposed face and can be effective with
extreme angles darkness and bad
quality according to the company
now if we consider what he said
an official an officer had
problems with darkened faces or
injured and included false positives and
cases in which he identified a
Palestine as a member of ever when
It was not a man commented that it was
arrested in a military control post
In northern Gaza they handcuffed him
They hit him for two days and
Then they released him and told him it was
an error allegedly for the work of
This program always grabbing what
that these officials commented with
This American medium therefore
This type of program of
facial recognition that is very
debated that generates controversy by itself
It is ethical is not ethical it is risky not
It is good is already being used according to
United States or according to this medium state
Unidense in the Gaza Strip for
