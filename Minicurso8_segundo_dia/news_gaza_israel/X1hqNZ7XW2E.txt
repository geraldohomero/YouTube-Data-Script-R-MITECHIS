TO BE WORKED AND IT'S SOMETHING
THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED EVEN AS
ISRAEL IS DEALING WITH THE
CURRENT THREAT.
>> YEAH.
AS I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER WE
HAD SEEN AN UPTICK IN ATTACKS
AGAINST U.S. MILITARY FACILITIES
AGAINST TROOPS AROUND THE
REGION.
OVERNIGHT THE PENTAGON ANNOUNCED
IT WAS INCREASING ITS FORCE,
POSTURE IN THE REGION.
HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT IRAN
TRYING TO ESCALATE THIS WAR?
>> WE ARE CONCERNED.
IN FACT, WE EXPECT THAT THERE'S
A LIKELIHOOD OF ESCALATION.
AN ESCALATION BY IRANIAN PROXIES
DIRECTED AGAINST OUR FORCES,
DIRECTED AGAINST OUR PERSONNEL.
WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY DEFEND
OUR PEOPLE AND RESPOND
DECISIVELY IF WE NEED TO.
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WANT AND NOT
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
WE DON'T WANT ESCALATION.
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A SECOND OR
THIRD FRONT DEVELOP.
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR FORCES
AND OUR PERSONNEL COME UNDER
FIRE, BUT IF THAT HAPPENS, WE
ARE READY FOR IT.
>> IS THE U.S. OPPOSED TO A
PREEMPTIVE STRIKE BY ISRAEL AS
HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BY SOME
ISRAELI OFFICIALS?
>> THE ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN VERY
CLEAR WITH US AND WE SHARE THIS
VIEW.
NO ONE WANTS A SECOND OR THIRD
FRONT INCLUDING WHEN IT COMES TO
LEBANON, NORTHERN ISRAEL AND
SOUTHERN LEBANON AND THAT'S NOT
IN ANYONE'S INTEREST AND THAT'S
WHY WE SENT A VERY STRONG
MESSAGE TO TRY TO DETER
HEZBOLLAH, DETER IRAN MORE
DIRECTLY FROM OPENING UP A
SECOND FRONT.
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SPEAK TO
THIS VERY CLEARLY AND HE'S PUT
COUNTRIES AND NON-STATE ACTORS
ON WARNING.
DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
SITUATION.
WE'VE ALSO DEPLOYED VERY
SIGNIFICANT ASSETS FROM THE
REGION AND TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIER
BATTLE GROUPS NOT TO PROVOKE,
BUT TO DETER, TO MAKE CLEAR THAT
IF ANYONE TRIES TO DO ANYTHING
WE ARE THERE.
