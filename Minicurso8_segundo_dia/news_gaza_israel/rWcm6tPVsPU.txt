Find our correspondent Stéphane
Amar Hello Stéphane always a lot
Questions on the day after the raid charged
in Israel on the Iranian consulate of
Damascus the Nations Security Council
united met yesterday urgently in New
York Russia accuses Benyamine
Netaniaah to want to quote to feed
The conflict is the first
Israeli minister wants to push Iran
and its ally Lebanese Hbolah at
climbing in any case that's what I
can tell you is that from here
operations that are carried out in Iran are
praised by the majority of opinion I
Also went to the border
which is almost deserted the whole north
of Israel we are talking about 80,000 to 100,000
people who would have left their
home to go further south and well
In this north we are even more
determined at climbing precisely
That is to say to make the Hzbolah back down
who you know in violation of a
UN resolution approached
the Israeli border and the objective
Well from Israel is to do so
back down at least beyond the Litan river
that is to say about twenty
kilometers from the border with Israel
But if that is not the case and well yes
Israelis seem determined to
climbing seem determined to
multiply the strikes against
Hezbollah and therefore indirectly against
Iran which supports this Shiite militia
and therefore intensify this campaign of
bombardment or even an operation
large -scale terrestrial
tsal officials explain
regularly as the experience they
are acquiring in Gaza
especially against these famous tunnels which
were cried under the Gaza Strip
Well, could be used against the
Hezbola since Hezbola also has
dug a large number of tunnel at the
border between Lebanon and Israel
Stéphan Amara in Jerusalem thank you very much
