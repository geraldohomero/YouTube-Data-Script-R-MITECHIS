ARE TRAPPED BY ISRAEL'S WAR WITH
HAMAS CHOKED BY BLOCKADES
SURROUNDED BY TROOPS AND TANKS.
NOW THEY ARE BEING TOLD TO MOVE.
>> ISRAEL'S MILITARY TOLD THEM
TO RELOCATE SOUTH OF THE GAZA
STRIP.
>> Andrew: THE ENTIRE NORTHERN
HALF OF THE GAZA STRIP HAS BEEN
TOLD BY THE ISRAELI MILITARY TO
FLEE SOUTH OF A WETLAND.
SEPARATING GAZA CITY.
>> ADDING TO THE TENSION.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ISRAELI
TRIPS ARE WAITING FOR THE
GO-AHEAD TO INVADE.
>> Andrew: THE U.N. CALLS THIS
IMPOSSIBLE.
MOVING A MILLION PEOPLE IN 24
HOURS.
HERE'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE.
>> THEY ARE WIPING US OUT.
THIS IS GENOCIDE.
IT'S NOT AN ATTACK ANYWHERE.
THEY WANT EVERYTHING.
>> Andrew: THE WOMAN FROM
ISRAELI MILITARY CAME EARLY IN
MORNING.
CIVILIANS OF GAZA CITY, EVACUATE
SOUTH FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY AND
THE SAFETY OF YOUR FAMILIES.
ALSO WITHIN THAT POST, A WARNING
NOT TO FLEE TOWARDS ISRAEL.
DO NOT APPROACH THE BORDER
FENCE.
THEY SAY.
THE MILITARY'S TARGET IN THE
NORTH IS HAMAS WHAT THEY CALL
SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS.
FROM ALL REPORTS WHAT THAT LOOKS
LIKE IS THIS.
[ SPEAKING ALTERNATE LANGUAGE ]
>> Andrew: THE U.N. HAS IMPLORED
ISRAEL TO WITHDRAW ITS ORDER FOR
MASSIVE EVACUATION WARNING OF
DEVASTATING HUMANITARIAN
CONSEQUENCE.
UNDERSTAND, THERE IS ONLY ONE
MAIN ROAD UP AND DOWN THE GAZA.
STREETS ARE BROKEN.
THOUSANDS ARE HURT.
MANY PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO MOVE.
HOSPITALS ARE OVERWHELMED.
SO MANY VEHICLES ARE NOW TWISTED
METAL AND THE ONES THAT AREN'T
MAY NOT HAVE GAS.
THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY.
NO RUNNING WATER.
NO FOOD COMING IN.
TRANSLATION, NO WAY TO
ACCOMPLISH WHAT ISRAEL HAS BEEN
ASKED.
GAZAN OFFICIALS ARE SENDING
THEIR PEOPLE A DIFFERENT
MESSAGE.
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
THEY CALL ISRAEL'S WARFARE FAKE
PROPAGANDA AND FAKE.
HAMAS HAVE CALLED ON THE FREE
PEOPLE OF OUR ARAB AND ISLAMIC
FACE AROUND THE -- NATION AROUND
THE WORLD TO RISE UP AND GO OUT
IN ROARING CROWDS.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A
PROTEST OR THREAT.
WITH THE EMOTIONS RUNNING THIS
HIGH, THAT DISTINCTION MAY NOT
MATTER.
THEY ARE WARNING ALL ISRAELIS
ABROAD TAKE EXTRA CARE.
SHOW ALERTNESS, STAY AWAY FROM
PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS.
THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS IN HEBREW
OF INCREASED SECURITY AT ISRAELI
EMBASSY WORLDWIDE.
