the body of ayasa 33 years old has
arrived in his village just outside
of janine he is one of two members of
the palestinian
intelligence that were killed in a
shootout with
israeli special forces overnight the
village has come out
to mourn the body also members of the
palestinian forces fatah the yellow
flags or flags of fatah
has been shooting in the air and the
body is now going to be taken
to his family
we received the news with sadness and i
can say we were desperate
a young man like him with his wife
pregnant in her ninth month
imagine the situation for us his friends
we spend our lives with him and now we
lost him this is something that we
suffer as palestinians
being arrested getting killed all these
things thank god we still have patience
we know that any of us can face a
similar fate prayers at the mosque have
now finished and they've taken
the body to the cemetery here in the
village uh to be
buried now palestinians will tell you
that these kinds of raids are not
unusual in fact they are extremely
common
they happen on a daily basis what is
unusual is to see israeli and
palestinian forces exchange fire with
each other there is something in place
here tight security cooperation when it
comes
to israel and the palestinian authority
usually when you see these kinds of
raids the palestinian forces will not
get involved there's been condemnation
from the palestinian government it's
spokesperson condemning the raid calling
on the international community
uh to do more israel says it was trying
to arrest two operatives of islamic
jihad
it blames for a shooting at its soldiers
at a junction in the occupied west bank
just a couple of months ago so there is
an investigation ongoing but certainly a
lot of anger here people saying that
they don't believe there'll be justice
for this
