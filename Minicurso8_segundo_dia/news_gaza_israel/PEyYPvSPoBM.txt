that an explosion was reported in gaza's
Al Ali Arab Hospital which tragically
and reportedly killed over 500 people
Hamas immediately blamed Israel for the
attack on civilians Israeli Defense
Forces categorically denied their
involvement in the attack India today's
aent team meanwhile is dug deeper to
identify whether Israel indeed targeted
the hospital and here's what we
found
October 17 Gaza City explosion at the Al
Ali Arab Hospital hours later blame game
continues Gaza officials blame Israel
air
strike the Israel army blames a rocket
misfired by the Palestinian Islamic
Jihad
terrorists
it's Palestinian terrorist
organizations that all the time are
shooting and targeting civilians it's
also it's only
illustrating the way they are hiding
between citizens and they shoot this
missile by the way I don't know if they
did it in purpose or it was a
mistake so what really happened India
today's open- Source intelligence team
analyzed the pictures and videos posted
online satellite images reveal a
discolored blast area the parking lot of
the hospital compound there's no
structural damage to adjacent buildings
there seem to be no visible signs of a
large crater in the parking lot or any
substantial damage to the buildings
close by these signs make the aerial
bombing Theory less plausible
video footage released by the Israel
Defense Force from the morning hours
also shows just burned cars the hospital
building seems intact so were hundreds
really killed as Gaza officials
claimed another set of aerial images
released by Israel shows only shrapnel
on the building roof the United States
has already given a clean chit to
Israel deeply saddened an outrage by the
uh explosion at the hospital in gazi
yesterday and based on what I've seen it
appears as though it was done by the
other team not not
you the UK has said it's establishing
facts
independently I know the whole house
would have been shocked by the scenes at
Al Ali Hospital any loss of innocent
life is a dreadful tragedy our
intelligence Services have been rapid
analyzing the evidence to independently
establish the
facts for now there appear to be more
clue suggesting that the massacre was
likely a rocket failure than a targeted
bombing from the skies with bidisha Saha
