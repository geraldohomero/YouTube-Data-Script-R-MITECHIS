Today we celebrate 100 days
100 days of the terrible day they were massacred
Kidnapped our citizens we're continuing the war up
End to end. To the ultimate victory until we have all
Our goal is to eliminate the violence, the return of all abductees and promises
That Gaza would never be another threat to Israel
We will restore security to both the South and the Czech Republic
No one will stop us. Not the Hegg, not the axis of evil
And no. No one
After the Philadelphia axis
He's one option of what I call closing
Southern or Southern Blockade. You know we are No, I'm not

Once again, I'll be throwing more weapons

I told the secretary that
The state Blink and we will not return any residents there
This is the situation right now. The question I think is divided
Two for the security budget, one for the other
This year and two more we will commit to the next few years
And we have to answer for both
One of the things about this budget is how much you are Going
Add to this year and I've determined that while you're fat
This is a special witness that we will establish in cooperation
between the Department of Defense The Treasury Department has more
The people who have been added to them will also give us you
Their summary on a huge addition has no other word
For the next few years, we will be creating the same independence
With equipment
And other things that are necessary to ensure our safety
In years
The coming
