this
life and I mean this literally when the
pure unadulterated evil is Unleashed on
this
world the people of Israel live through
one such moment this
weekend the bloody hands of the
terrorist organization ofas
a group whose stated purpose for being
is to kill
Jews this was an act of sheer
evil more than 1,000 civilians
slaughtered not just kill slaughtered in
Israel among them at least 14 American
citizens
killed so in this
moment we must be Crystal Clear we stand
with with
Israel we stand with
Israel and we will make sure Israel has
what it needs to take care of it
citizens defend itself and respond to
this attack there's no justification for
terrorism there's no
excuse

terrorism my team has been in near
constant communication with our Israeli
partners and partners all across the
region and the world from the moment
this Crisis began we're surging
additional military assistants including
ammunition and interceptors to replenish
Iron
Dome we're going to make sure that
Israel does not run out of these
critical assets to defend its cities and
its
citizens my Administration has consulted
closely with Congress throughout this
crisis when Congress returns we're going
to ask them to take urgent action to
fund the National Security requirements
of our critical
Partners this is not about party or
politics this about the security of our
world the security of the United States
