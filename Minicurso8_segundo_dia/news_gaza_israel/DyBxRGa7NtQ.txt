BEEN STAGING ALONG THE BORDER
CROSSING, THE RAFAH CROSSING
WITH EGYPT, FOR DAYS FROM
AROUND THE WORLD TRYING TO GET
TO 2 MILLION ARE PEOPLE OR SO
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
CONFLICT IN GAZA.
IT APPEARS AFTER A REQUEST FOR
THAT FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN AND
SIGNALING THAT HE WILL GIVE

HAMAS HAS SAID THAT THERE ARE
500 PEOPLE DEAD, AND THAT IT
WAS AN ISRAELI FIGHTER JACKET
PART OF THE AIRSTRIKES THAT LED

POINT OUT THAT NBC NEWS, AND NO
OTHER AGENCY CAN CONFIRM THIS.

THE SITE.
WHAT YOU'RE HEARING ON THE
GROUND IS A LOT OF SPECULATION
AND PEOPLE NOT CERTAIN WHO IS
