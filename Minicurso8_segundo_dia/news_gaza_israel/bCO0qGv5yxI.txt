>>> DURING A SUNDAY SESSION, 
THE SENATE  ADVANCED FOR UKRAINE
AND ISRAEL A $95 BILLION AID  
BAGGAGE . THERE IS CONCERN AMONG
DEMOCRATS WHEN IT COMES TO HOW 
ISRAEL MIGHT BE USING THIS AND  
SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY SPOKE WITH 
MARGARET BRENNAN YESTERDAY 
ABOUT THIS. 
>> IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO 
MAKE CLEAR THAT IF ISRAEL USE 
THIS  IN GAZA IT IS TO BE DONE 
WITH LESS CIVILIAN LIFE LOST. I 
THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.  
>> SCOTT MacFARLANE JOINS US  
WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THIS. 
CLEARLY EVERYONE WAS IN FAVOR 
OF THIS BILL. CAN YOU TALK TO 
ME ABOUT THE CONCERNS? 
>> Reporter: THE BIGGEST 
CONCERN COMES AFTER THE UNITED 
STATES SENATE IS DONE . 67 
SENATORS SUPPORTED MOVING THIS 
TOWARD APPROVAL TOMORROW OR 
WEDNESDAY. THIS IS ON A 
TRAJECTORY TOWARD PASSING IN 
THE UNITED STATES SENATE, BUT 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? MOST 
REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THEY DO 
NOT SUPPORT MORE AID FOR 
UKRAINE AND ARE THEY SPEEDING 
TOWARD A DEAD-END OR A WALL 
THEY ARE GOING TO KNOCK DOWN? 
THERE WILL BE A CHANGE TO GIVE 
THIS A VOTE ON THE FLOOR. IT IS 
TO FORCE THIS ON THE FLOOR. 
THAT IS WHERE THE DRAMA IS THIS 
WEEK. 
>> AND OF COURSE THIS IS A LONG 
WAY OFF FROM THE ORIGINAL 
CONVERSATION THAT HAD FOREIGN 
AID PAIRED WITH MONEY FOR THE 
CRISIS THE. 
AND THROUGHOUT THIS WEEKEND, 
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS SPOKE ABOUT 
THIS. 
>> A PROTESTANT GROUP OF  
SENATORS HAVE PRESENTED US WITH 
THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THAT WE 
NEED FROM A GROUP AND YET 
CONGRESS KILLED IT BEFORE EVEN 
READING IT. 
>> I DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH 
INFLUENCE THE SECRETARY WILL 
HAVE BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING 
READY FOR ANOTHER ATTEMPT OF 
IMPEACHMENT. 
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 
THAT? 
>> Reporter: REPUBLICANS HAVE 
THE VOTES THEY NEED TO DO THIS 
THEY CAME UP SHORT  BUT THEY 
CAME UP WITH ANOTHER MEMBER, 
STEVE SCALISE, OF LOUISIANA. 
THEY'RE LIKELY TO PREVAIL BUT 
THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO TRIGGER 
THE IMPEACHMENT OF SECRETARY OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY ALEJANDRO 
MAYORKAS . THAT IS HEADING 
NOWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE THEY MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE 
TO STOP THE HOLDING OF A TRIAL. 
IT DOES ACCOMPLISH A POLITICAL 
GOAL. THEY WANT THE 
CONVERSATION TO GO TO BORDER
