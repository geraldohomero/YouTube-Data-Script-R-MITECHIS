approaching the Gaza border artillery
opens up we're on the way to near am one
of the rare kibot Sim that managed to
repulse the Hamas attack on October
7th some of the terrorists that were
trying to penetrate this kibutz came
from over here behind where you could
see all the burnt terrain those are
higher grounds and that's why they were
trying to come from that
direction only the rapid actions of
security staff in sealing the gate
prevented the horror unfolding outside
from getting
in several of the attackers died and the
Israeli Army secured the kibot less than
a kilometer from the Gaza border a few
hours later among them Israeli American
reservist major
shrager driving down here was just more
defying you every intersection had burnt
cars bodies laying around it was a total
war zone a war zone from which the Army
ultimately flushed out the remaining
Hamas
militants and after that we were going
every night to collect bodies of uh
Israeli hostages that didn't make it
alive beyond the border and every night
we're still uh going and finding more um
civilians uh some of them are handcuffed
some of them were women
children The Zone around Gaza is now a
tight controlled military zone and that
includes the kibot Sim within
it the soldiers are in these two houses
this is mine and this is the neighbors a
couple with two little
kids fanny has returned to her home for
the first time since the attack to
collect some of her
belongings the shooting was here it all
happened right
here this is home I hope many will come
back I'm full of
Hope there were new families with kids I
hope they'll
return that though may be a distant
Prospect for all too many caught up in
the October 7th attack and who are still
too deeply traumatized by the violence
to go back
