GETTING NPPLIES TO WHERE THEY
ARE MOST NEEDED IS COMPLICATED
BY THE DISASTER AND A CIVIL WAR.
CTV'S TOM WALTERS REPORTS FROM
ISTANBUL TONIGHT.
>> Reporter: SURROUNDED BY
DEATH AND DEBRIS, A NEW LIGHT IS
DELIVERED FROM THE RUINS OF THE
SYRIAN CITY OF ALEPPO.
THIS BABY GIRL WHO EMERGED FROM
THE FREEZING RUBBLE THREE HOURS
AFTER SHE WAS BORN IS JUST ONE
EXAMPLE THAT EVERY MINUTE
COUNTS.
A MASS MOBILIZATION IS UNDER WAY
FROM K9 UNITS DEPARTING MEXICO
TO SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS
MAKING THEIR WAY FROM CHINA, THE
USA, ITALY AND BEYOND.
MANY OF THE PLANES PACKED WITH
INTERNATIONAL AID ARE TRAVELLING
TOWARD TÃœRKIYE, WHICH IS THE
PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE.
ACCESS INTO THE DISASTER ZONE
INSIDE SYRIA'S NORTHWEST IS
POSING A HOST OF CHALLENGES.
>> SYRIA HAS SUFFERED A LOT
DURING THE LAST 10 YEARS.
>> Reporter: SYRIA'S HARDEST
HIT REGIONS IN THE NORTHWEST ARE
LARGELY CONTROLLED BY REBEL
FORCES WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING
THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT FOR
MORE THAN A DECADE.
GOVERNMENT ISSUED PERMITS ARE
NEEDED TO ENTER.
THAT INCLUDES THOSE BRINGING AID
ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRY'S U.N.
AMBASSADOR.
>> WITHOUT THE CONTROL OF THE
GOVERNMENT, WITHOUT PERMISSION
OF THE GOVERNMENT, WITHOUT
APPROVAL FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
THIS IS VIOLATION.
>> Reporter: HERE BUILDINGS
HAVE PREVIOUSLY COLLAPSED FROM
AIR STRIKES CARRIED OUT BY THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND ITS
RUSSIAN ALLIES WHO HAVE MILITARY
BASES IN THE REGION AND ARE NOW
SOME OF THE ONLY RESCUE CREWS ON
THE GROUND.
[Speaking in Alternate
Language]
INSIDE A SHELTER, THIS MOTHER
SAYS, TO BE HONEST, THIS IS
HARDER THAN WAR.
AIR STRIKES PASS.
HERE WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS
ENDS.
AS FOR THE BABY GIRL, HER MOTHER
DID NOT SURVIVE.
THIS DOCTOR SHARES THAT HER
MOTHER GAVE BIRTH UNDER THE
RUBBLE AND ALL HER FAMILY HAD
DIED.
A HARSH REMINDER THAT STORIES OF
HOPE AND SURVIVAL COME AGAINST A
BACKDROP OF AGONIZING LOSS.
NOW AS RESCUERS ARRIVE FROM ALL
OVER THE WORLD, THE QUESTION IS
NOT JUST WHO GOES WHERE, BUT
WHETHER THEY CAN GET THERE AT
ALL.
OMAR?
