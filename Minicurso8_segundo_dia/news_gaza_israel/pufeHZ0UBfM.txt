GATHERING ITS STRENGTH TO INVADE
THE LAST HAMAS STRONGHOLD IN 
RAFAH.

FOR HIS LONG-PROMISED OFFENSIVE.
WELCOME TO A NEW HOUR OF

INTERESTING MORNING SO FAR.
THE ISRAELI LEADER FORGING AHEAD
DESPITE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S 
PRESSURE TO HOLD OFF AGAINST 
INVADING RAFAH TO TAKE OUT THE 
IRANIAN-BACKED TERROR GROUP.
CRITICS SAY BIDEN'S CRITICISM IS
TYING THE HANDS OF OUR CLOSEST 
ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHICH 
ONLY ENCOURAGES HAMAS TO DIG IN 
ITS HEELS AND REJECTING A 
CEASE-FIRE DEAL.

DEPARTMENT IS NOT BUYING IT.

INVASION OF RAFAH WOULD HAVE AN 
ENORMOUSLY HARMFUL EFFECT ON 
CIVILIANS AND ULTIMATELY HURT 
ISRAEL'S SECURITY.

TAKES PLACE FOR A VARIETY OF 
REASONS.
