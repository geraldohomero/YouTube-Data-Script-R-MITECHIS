BROTHER BOTH KILLED.
HOW HE'S REMEMBERING THEIR
LOVED ONES WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES
FOR THEIR HOME.
>> RIGHT NEAR THE GAZA BORDER,
HOPE IS SHOT UP, LIVING ROOMS
HOPE IS SHOT UP, LIVING ROOMS
BOMBED OUT.
THEY TELL THE STORY OF WHAT
HAPPENED IN THEIR FAMILIES.
JUST 12 YEARS OLD.
WE KNOW -- ONCE YOU SEE THE
AREA.
LIVING IN A WAR ZONE, HE TELLS
ME WHAT HE AND HIS FRIENDS WILL
DO TODAY.
>> I WANT TO KEEP THEM -- [
INDISCERNIBLE ]
>> IT IS A WAY TO REMEMBER HIS
DAD, AND HIS OLDER BROTHER. TWO
MEN THAT THIS TOWN WILL NEVER
FORGET.
>> THEY WERE NOT JUST KILLED,
THEY FOUGHT LIKE LIONS.
THE DAY THAT HAMAS ATTACKED
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD, THEY SHOWED
THE MILITARY AS THEY CORNER
TERRORIST.
FOR HOURS, REGULAR CITIZENS
TOOK TO THE STREETS TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES.
THE RESIDENT SAY THAT THE
TERRORISTS DID SOMETHING THEY
NEVER HAVE SEEN OR HEARD OF
BEFORE, THEY WERE HIDING OUT.
WHEN THE ROCKETS WERE FIRED
FROM GAZA, AND PEOPLE RAN OUT
OF THEIR HOMES, THE HAMAS
TERRORIST WERE RIGHT THERE
FIRING AT PEOPLE AS THEY ENTER
THE SHELTER.
>> WE HAVE 64 FAMILIES FROM THE
STREET OVER THAT CAME OUT OF
STREET OVER THAT CAME OUT OF
THEIR HOUSES.
THEY SLAUGHTERED THEM.
>> AS WE DO EVERY YEAR, HIS
FATHER AND BROTHERS STARTED
THAT DAY HOSTING 50 KIDS WITH
SPECIAL NEEDS, VOLUNTEER WORK
THAT THEY WOULD LOVE TO DO.
WHEN THE ATTACKS STARTED, A
RESERVIST GRABBED HIS GUN,
RUSHING THE CHILDREN TO THE
SAFE ROOM AND HEADED OUT TO
FIGHT.
>> THEY WERE THE FIRST ONES ON
THE SCENE, THEY SAW A UNIT OF
TERRORIST.
THEY HELD THEM IN PLACE BY
STUDENTS, MY BROTHER WAS ABLE
TO KILL TWO TERRORISTS, HE WAS
SHOOTING BECAUSE SOME OF THE
TERRORISTS WERE STANDING ON THE
ROOF TRYING TO SHOOT AT
EVERYBODY THAT WALKED PAST THE
STREET.
>> THE FAMILY KNOWS HOW IT
ENDED, SHARING THIS HAUNTING
PHOTO, THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE
ON THE GROUND, IS A SON HUGGING
HIS FATHER AS HE WAS EXECUTED.
NOW, AROUND EVERY CORNER, YOU
SEE FAMILIES, CHILDREN
COLLECTING BULLETS, EACH MORNING
IN THEIR OWN WAY.
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO
REMEMBER ABOUT YOUR FATHER AND
BROTHER?
>> GOOD THINGS, THEY DID GOOD
THINGS BEFORE THEY DIED.
>> THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE.
THERE IS A WAR HERE AND A WAR
IN GAZA OVER THERE, WHY ARE YOU
STILL HERE?
>> THIS IS THE ONLY JEWISH --
HOME AND IF WE DO NOT PROTECT
IT OR LIVE FREELY AND
