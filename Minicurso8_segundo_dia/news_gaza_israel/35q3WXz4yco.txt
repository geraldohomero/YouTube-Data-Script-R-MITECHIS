the european union says it continues to
support a two-state solution and that
won't change after annexation
but historically the eu has done little
to sanction israel's settlement
expansion or human rights abuses in the
run-up to annexation
rhetoric has grown stronger
we have been trying to explain to our
israelis friends
that
on the same way that the security of
israel is something not negotiable for
us the unilateral annexation would be
something that we could not support this
week more than a thousand european
politicians signed a letter opposing
annexation it said
acquisition of territory by force has no
place in 2020 and must have commensurate
consequences
failure to adequately respond would
encourage other states with territorial
claims to disregard principles of
international law
but still the chances of eu sanctions
seem remote getting all 27 members to
agree is almost impossible
some members are pushing for a tough
response they include luxembourg belgium
and sweden and israel has a lot to lose
europe is its biggest trading partner it
shares in eu research programs and many
israelis see themselves as european
but israel has forged close ties with
central and eastern eu states
in particular victor orban's hungary
victor urban has proved to be a superb
diplomat you say
it has blocked moves to punish israel in
the past and says it will do so again
and it won't be alone
germany sent its foreign minister to
jerusalem this month he declared
annexation would be illegal but given
its wartime history the country is
unlikely to support sanctions
what we hope is that
really
israel should feel the heat of
international pressure
whatever form israel's annexation takes
the palestinians can expect statements
of condemnation from brussels
but as they know from bitter experience
criticism and meaningful economic and
political sanctions against israel are
two very different things simon mcgregor
would trt world
