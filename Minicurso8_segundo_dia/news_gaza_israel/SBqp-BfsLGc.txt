 
 LIFELINE FOR THE PALESTINIANS.
 ASHLEY: THANK YOU, GREAT 
 INTERVIEW.
 PRESIDENT BIDEN CALLING FOR 
 ISRAEL TO OPERATE BY THE LAWS 
 OF WAR.
 WE DON'T HAVE THAT SOUNDBITE.
 LET'S BRING IN HEINRICH, THE 
 SPOKESPERSON TO BENJAMIN 
 NETANYAHU AND JOINS US NOW.
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
 WILL YOU ARE BY BY THE LAWS OF 
 WAR AS THE PRESIDENT SAYS?
 HEINRICH:OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE A 
 JEWISH AND DEMOCRATIC STATE AND
 WE WILL ABIDE BY THE LAWS OF 
 WAR, AND SPECIFIED A CLEAR GOAL
 FOR THE OPERATION OF GAZA, AND 
 MAKE SURE BY THE END OF THIS 
 WAR WE DIDN'T START, IT WAS 
 FORCED UPON US, DRAGGED TO IT 
 BY HAMAS.
 BY THE END OF THIS, THEY WILL 
 NO LONGER HAVE THE GOVERNANCE 
 BODY OR MILITARY CAPABILITIES 
 OR THE MOTIVATION TO EVERETT US
 AS THEY DID BEFORE OCTOBER 7TH 
 WHEN THEY RICHARD -- BUTCHERED 
 OUR PEOPLE AND KIDNAPPED 203 
 ISRAELIS ARE STILL HELD HOSTAGE
 IN GAZA.
 WE WILL ACT AND WE ARE ACTING 
 LIKE ANY WESTERN NATION UNDER 
 SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, TO ADD A 
 BIT TO IT, PLEASE REMEMBER 
 HAMAS IS NOT A STATE ACTOR.
 THIS IS A MURDEROUS, MONSTROUS 
 TERROR ORGANIZATION.
 THE GENEVA CONVENTION DOES NOT 
 APPLY TO IT.
 ASHLEY: I HAVE LESS THAN ONE 
 MINUTE.
 THE GOAL, MR.
 NETANYAHU SAID, TO WIPE HAMAS 
 OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
 IS THAT POSSIBLE?
 HEINRICH:THAT'S A QUESTION OUR 
 MILITARY LEADERSHIP AND 
 GOVERNMENT IS DISCUSSING.
 IT IS POSSIBLE.
 JUST LIKE THE CASE WITH ISIS 
 WHEN WE SIGN INTERNATIONAL 
 COALITION TO DEFEAT THIS 
 TERRORIST MONSTER.
 THIS IS THE CASE WE ARE SEEING 
 AND ARE THANKFUL FOR THE US 
 GLOBAL LEADERSHIP.
 WHEN YOU GUYS SET THE TONE AND 
 YOU ARE DOING IT RIGHT NOW, 
 OTHERS FOLLO
