Israel has declared a state of war after
an unprecedented attack by Hamas on Saturday.
Israeli officials say more than 600 people have been
killed and thousands more are wounded since the attack.
Us Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel
has the full support of the United States.
President Biden's direction
was to make sure that we're providing Israel everything it needs
in this moment to deal with the attacks from Hamas.
Israel continues its military response destroying around 800 targets in Gaza.
According to authorities near the Gaza border,
Israel is now evacuating communities to get their citizens
out of harm's way as they begin military operations.
Israeli military is united
ready
on all fronts. Also, we've ramped up our defenses in the north.
We've mobilized reserves.
We are motivated to defend our country.
The Israeli defense forces say more than 1000
Hamas fighters poured into the country on Saturday.
Hamas also
captured dozens of Israelis holding them hostage as well as some Americans.
Israeli officials say
I think it's scores of hostages.
I can tell you there's also American hostages as part of that number as well.
I don't want to get into a specific number.
Uh but these are women,
their Children.
The IDF says it will exhaust all options to get the hostages back.
What I can tell you is that we're not going to
stop until we exhaust every means possible of doing so.
We will not leave any person behind and we will do anything
to make that happen.
I'm Rob Kirkpatrick reporting
the US military is planning to move ships and
aircraft closer to Israel as a show of support,
the US is also working through plans for a possible
non combatant evacuation helping Americans get out of Israel.
