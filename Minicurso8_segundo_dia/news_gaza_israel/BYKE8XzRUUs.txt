for thousands of palestinian workers
this is a daily reality lining up at an
israeli checkpoint showing their permits
and hoping israeli border police allow
them to go to their jobs
and for these olive farmers the barrier
not only restricts their movement and
curtails their livelihoods but it also
cuts them off from their ancestral land
israelis call it a security necessity
palestinians call it the apartheid wall
in 2002 israel began construction on the
separation wall following a series of
suicide bombings and other attacks
it was meant to follow the green line
the internationally recognized border
between israel and the palestinian
territories but most of the current 705
kilometer long structure is built deep
inside palestinian land part wall part
fence it snakes through sections of
occupied east jerusalem preventing
palestinians from accessing al-aqsa
mosque and splitting families
the future is obscure we get an
education but we know that we will not
find work with the degrees we earned we
work and we know it's all going to waste
we won't be able to save money or do
anything
we are suffering from the occupation
pressure life is already difficult
without the occupation nevertheless with
it the international court of justice
says the wall violates international law
and says it should be dismantled
israel continues to defend the project
pointing to the reduction in attacks
since it was built
but just 65 percent of the planned
construction is complete
budget restraints and political
infighting in israel have caused years
of delay and for palestinians the
separation wall remains one of the most
visible signs of israel's brutal
occupation and will be a rallying point
for as long as it stands
