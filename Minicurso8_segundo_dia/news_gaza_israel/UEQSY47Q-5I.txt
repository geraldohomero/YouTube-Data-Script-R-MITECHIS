Nel we started to have images of the
famous and mysterious tunnels in
The Gaza Strip where the
Terrorists never in principle
a certain sector of journalism
International believed that these tunnels
They were an Israeli invention that justified
or that they served as an argument for this
siege that has been carrying out from
On October 7 but
Recently these images arose
This clip that in fact if they see here
It has the Israeli army because they are
official images and allow to see
First the structure of the tunnel no and
also with these photographs that
They show how they work inside
particularly this finding
corresponds to a tunnel that crosses the
South part of Gaza and is designed
to circulate within the same
vehicles are no longer small showcases
For people or denies but
They are clear military infrastructure for
that can so that cars can circulate
We are talking about dimensions
important yes and this is the video in
issue there is no animation but this
It is the video that allows you to see the size not
how vehicles enter and how
then mobilize an advance inside
Really important for the army
Israeli that during the last week has
really had great milestones in the
Gaza Strip this also makes us
Think how many are the kilometers of
tunnels in the gaza strip no
because we remember that the number that is
had advanced was 500 km if one
says in such a small place how could
have 500 km no yes totally many
outputs of this tunnel as if
It will deal with a branch coincide
With places protected by law
international as hospitals or schools
where other denies also work
So permanently on this side in
The western world we know a little
more how nets work
most important criminals and terrorists
of Gaza
