all right so let's start this broadcast
with the victory that we are tracking on
beyond at this r and this of course is
coming from the state of israel which is
battling with a pretty sharp rise in the
number of carbon 19 infections and if
that wasn't enough believe it or not
israel is also facing a double army
there is a serious outbreak of avian flu
that's been reported across the country
and more than 5 000 migratory birds that
were infected by this h5n1 virus have
reportedly died now this is being touted
as the deadliest wildlife disaster in
the country's history
authorities warned of a possible egg
shortage in the days to come
due to a culling of poultry birds that
has now been ordered as a precaution to
stop the spread
of the avian flu in the state of israel
can be
at this point of time the transmission
of the h5n1 virus to humans has been
reported however
israeli prime minister naftali bennett
met with his national security adviser
and other experts to discuss efforts to
contain the outbreak of avian flu within
the country
and also to further prevent it from
jumping from birds onto humans
and a bit to do so people who have been
in close contact with the infected birds
are being given preventive treatment
according to the israeli media children
who visited the reserve that is the
reserve of these migratory birds may
have contributed to the spread of the
flu but touching the stricken cranes at
the reserve
what you're looking on your screens it
shows at least 5 000 and 200 cranes
out of half a million which travel
through the state of israel
actually have died in israel's hula
valley
workers are now removing the carcasses
that lay afloat in the northern hulla
nature reserve
the south of thousands of cranes from
europe wintering at this reserve is
generally a delight for bird watchers
but the site recently has been declared
off bounds for common people
due to the devastating avian flu
outbreak
avian flu viruses occur naturally in
migratory waterfowl with domestic birds
being far more susceptible to the waters
and once the water is found in
commercial
and in household flocks then a rapid
destruction of these birds a calling of
these birds is recommended
