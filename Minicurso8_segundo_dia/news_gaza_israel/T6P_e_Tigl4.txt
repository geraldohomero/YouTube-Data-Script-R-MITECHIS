meanwhile as tensions continue to simmer
between israel and the west bank the
british conglomerate unilever has now
said that it has sold its ben and
jerry's ice cream business in israel to
a local license for an undisclosed
amount the development comes nearly a
year after the ice cream maker ben
jerry's had triggered fury
in israel by saying that it would stop
selling its products in west bank
unilever which is a british
multinational consumer goods company
bought the american company ben and
jerry's in the year 2000 under the
agreement ben jerry's independent board
has the sole right to make decisions
about social issues while unilever is
responsible for financial and
operational decisions
the british conglomerate's decision to
sell off its business in israel is a
culmination of an 11 month long pressure
campaign over its plan to wind up its
businesses in the illegally occupied
west bank territories of the
palestinians
it was a part of the international
boycott and sanctions movement that
seeks to isolate the state of israel
for
encroaching on palestinian lands and
also the ill treatment that is meted out
to the palestinians by the israelis
supporters of last year's decision saw
it as a big boost for the long-running
international campaign against the west
bank occupation illegal occupation of
the west bank by the israelis
and now this latest decision to sell its
ben and jerry's business in the state of
israel to a local partner is being seen
as a bit of a diplomatic escape by the
british conglomerate from the brewing
tensions
under the new ownership the ice cream
will have slightly different branding
with hebrew and arabic labels rather
than english ones it will be sold both
in the state of israel and also
in the west bank region
israel's foreign ministry has called the
decision as a huge victory and also win
against the discrimination
