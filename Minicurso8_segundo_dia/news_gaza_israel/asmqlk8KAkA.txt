HOST TO TALK ABOUT LAST NIGHT'S
BIGGEST WINNERS AT THE GOLDEN
GLOBES. GOOD AFTERNOON. MAJOR
DISRUPTIONS TO CITY TRAFFIC AS
BLOCKED THE HOLLAND TUNNEL,
BROOKLYN BRIDGE AND MANHATTAN
BRIDGE THIS MORNING. WE ARE
LIVE AT THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE
WITH THE LATEST. THE BRIDGE IS
NOW CLEAR?
REPORTER : IT IS, PLEASE
TELL ME ALL LOCATIONS ARE NOW
CLEAR BUT THIS WAS A MASSIVE
DEMONSTRATION. HUNDREDS OF
PEOPLE BLOCKING TRAFFIC IN AND
OUT OF MANHATTAN. WE SAW PEOPLE
CHAINING RAMMING DEVICES TO
OFF WITH BUZZ SAWS AS THEY WERE
ARRESTED. ONE OF THE WOMEN HERE
TELLS ME THAT IS TO MAKE SURE
THEY BLOCKED OFF AS MUCH
TRAFFIC AS POSSIBLE. IT ALL
STARTED AROUND 10:00 THIS
MORNING. A COORDINATED PROTEST
BLOCKING BRIDGES AND TUNNELS.
VIDEO SHOWS DEMONSTRATORS
SITTING AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE
BROOKLYN BRIDGE. THE SAME SCENE
AT THE HOLLAND TUNNEL WHERE
POLICE ARRESTED DOZENS WHO
BLOCKED THE ENTRANCE. DOZENS
MORE ARRESTS HERE AT THE
MANHATTAN BRIDGE. NYPD OFFICERS
BRIDGES, DISPATCHING OFFICERS
TO ALL THREE LOCATIONS. POLICE
SAY THINGS WERE MOSTLY PEACEFUL
BUT THEY CAUSED MAJOR
DISRUPTIONS TO DRIVERS.
I THINK AS THE VIOLENCE
ESCALATES, WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR
MESSAGE KNOWN. IT IS NOT COMING
FROM THE TOP SO THAT PEOPLE ARE
SENDING THE MESSAGE. IT IS OUR
TAX DOLLARS.
TO AN ISRAELI ESSENTIALLY
FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE FOR
EVERYONE?
I AM AN ANTI-ZIONIST JEWISH
PERSON AND I KNOW FOR MY
TO HAPPEN AGAIN. WHEN WE SAY
NEVER AGAIN WE MAY NEVER AGAIN
FOR EVERYONE.
Reporter : YESTERDAY MARKS
THREE MONTHS SINCE HAMAS
ATTACKED ISRAEL AND ISRAEL
INVADED GAZA IN RESPONSE.
PEOPLE SAY THEY PLAN TO
ESCALATE THE DEMONSTRATIONS
UNTIL THERE IS A COMPLETE
CEASE-FIRE. WE DID MEET ONE
SINGLE MAN OUT HERE HOLDING AN
ISRAELI FLAG. HE SAID HE WAS ON
HIS WAY TO WORK, COULD NOT GET
PULLED THE FLAG OUT OF HIS
TRUNK AND STOOD OUT HERE. HE
TELLS ME THAT DEMONSTRATORS ARE
JUST UNINFORMED.
