IS INTERTWINED WITH THE
ARAB/ISRAELI CONFLICT.

ARABS AND JEWS HAVE BALLOTED
OVER THE SACRED STRETCH OF
DESERT BETWEEN THE MEDITERRANEAN

OF A WAVE OF JEWISH IMMIGRATION
TOWARD PALESTINE AND BECAME AN
ICON, WRITING DOZENS OF BOOKS
ABOUT LIFE IN THE DIASPORA.

WAS MURDERED IN 1921.
HUNDREDS OF ARABS AND JEWS DIED
IN THAT VIOLENCE.
MORE THAN A CENTURY LATER, THIS
STREET LOOKS NOTHING LIKE IT DID
BACK THEN, AND YET THE VIOLENCE
HASN'T STOPPED.
HIS SON'S FIGHT WOULD BE FOR
ISRAEL'S INDEPENDENCE.
HE JOINED THE JEWISH UNDERGROUND
ARMY AND BECAME A COMMANDER.

FATHER JUMPED OUT OF A TANK AND
BROKE HIS BACK, IN A BODY CAST
FOR MONTHS.

GRANDCHILDREN NOW SERVING IN
THIS WAR?
