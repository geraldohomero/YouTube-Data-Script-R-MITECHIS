strike at Al Ali Arab Hospital in Gaza
City including patients healthcare
workers and families that had been
seeking refuge in and around the

afternoon when an under school was hit
in Al magazi refugee camp in gaza's
Middle area the school had been serving
as a shelter for some 4,000 people

that situation which continues to unfold
as we speak can only be described as an
utter
catastrophe in just 10 days since Hamas
militants attacked Israel on the 7th of
October the death toll has already
exceeded that of the 2014
hostilities which lasted more than 7
weeks so far more than
2,800 Palestinians have been killed more
than
10,850 injured and hundreds are believed
to be TR trapped under
Rubble Israeli authorities have also now
confirmed that
1,300 Israelis have been killed and more
than
4,100 injured nearly 200 remain
captive they must be treated humanely
hostages must be released
immediately humanitarians have not been
spared 15 unra staff and five from the
Red Cross and red crescent movement have
been
