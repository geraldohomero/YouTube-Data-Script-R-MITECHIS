we leave you tonight with an alberta
couple who left everything behind except
a few well-oiled traditions and moved to
the uk
daniel himamjin on a side order outside
london
in a part of southern england known to
hollywood for its great filming
locations this historic market town is
also where the lives of a few canadians
are going completely off script
bob vandal has one word to describe this
food truck and the poutine chicken wings
and canadian deep fried pickles he's
selling
this is retirement
this is retirement 100 this is
retirement
in 2018 bob and his partner cheryl said
goodbye to the corporate world there
comes a point in your life when you're
feeling what you just can't take it
anymore i think we just got tired of the
corporate bs
and it was really taking its toll on me
he sold everything and moved to england
where he was born with 22 boxes and his
harley-davidson
he also brought across the pond and back
to life the funky pickle
a landmark once popular with the
university crowd in edmonton
when i got to a certain age i realized
that there's a jigsaw puzzle of your
life and it still had some pieces
that were empty
bob's father served in the second world
war and was stationed near here his
forefathers are from gunawage every part
of his life has a spot on this truck
it's so rewarding to see
the british culture
and the british people really embrace
what we offer
it's a flavor
the gravy
this cheese um the wings are phenomenal
honestly our poutine
would be number one then there's colton
who left a high-paying job in fort
mcmurray to follow his dad
that's correct it sure did
why
uh you know i was just looking for
something a little different in life
there's everything canadian here except
maybe humility funky pickle they've
declared is the best food truck in
southern england
