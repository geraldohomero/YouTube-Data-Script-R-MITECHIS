EFFORT HERE.
THE PALESTINIANS ARE NOT ON
BOARD WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING
REGION WIDE.
>> MATT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
ISRAELIS RIGHT NOW.
ISRAEL HAS BEEN IN UPHEAVAL FOR
A YEAR NOW ABOUT THE SO-CALLED
JUDICIAL REFORMS.
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU BECAME PRIME
MINISTER, AGAIN.
ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN TAKING TO
THE STREETS BY THE HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS PROTESTING THIS
WILDLY UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENT.
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT
UNITES THE COUNTRY.
HE SENT 2200 ROCKETS OVERNIGHT
INTO ISRAEL, DO THE INTERNAL
PROTESTS IN ISRAEL FALL AWAY?
ISRAELIS RALLY AROUND BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU, CLEARLY, COME DOWN
ON HAMAS IN GAZA WITH A IRON
FIST.
>> I WAS JUST IN ISRAEL
COVERING THOSE PROTESTS AGAINST
THE JUDICIAL EFFORT BY
NETANYAHU.
THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER IN
ISRAEL, PARTICULARLY IN TEL
AVIV, AGAINST NETANYAHU.
THIS IS A DEEPLY DIVIDED
COUNTRY.
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S EFFORTS TO
TRY TO RAILROAD THROUGH HIS
JUDICIAL, WHAT HE CALLS,
REFORMS, THAT WAS VERY, VERY,
CONTENTIOUS.
THEY'RE VERY CONTROVERSIAL!
I COULDN'T THINK OF A BETTER
GIFT FOR BENJAMIN NETANYAHU
RIGHT NOW THAN THIS KIND OF
INCURSION.
HE CAN NOW POSITION HIMSELF, AS
HE HAS REPEATEDLY, THROUGHOUT
HIS VERY LONG TENURE OF RUNNING
ISRAEL, HE CAN NOW SAY, I AM
THE FULL PROTECTIVE THIS
NATION.
IF YOU GO AGAINST ME, LOOK AT
WHAT YOU ARE UP AGAINST.
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING
RIGHT NOW.
HE WILL, UNDOUBTEDLY, ONCE THE
SMOKE CLEARS --
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT IS
GOING TO BE.
THIS LOOKS LIKE A VERY HOT
CONFLICT.
ONE THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A
VERY LONG TIME.
AS YOU MENTIONED, 50 YEARS
SINCE THE YARMULKE POOR WAR.
WE ARE GOING TO BE SEEING
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, THIS VERY
CONTENTIOUS LEADER OF ISRAEL, A
DIVIDED COUNTRY, HE IS GONNA
COME OUT --
I AM VERY SURE HE IS GONNA COME
OUT AND SAY, I'M THE SOLE
PROTECTOR OF THIS COUNTRY.
LOOK AT THE THREAT THAT WE ARE
FACING.
NOT JUST FROM THE PALESTINIANS,
BUT FROM OUR NEIGHBORS.
IF THE ARAB NEIGHBORS OF ISRAEL
ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE AND JOIN
THE CAUSED BY HAMAS TO
PARTICIPATE IN THIS FIGHT
AGAINST ISRAEL.
