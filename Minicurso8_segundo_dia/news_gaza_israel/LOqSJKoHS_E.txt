NOT SINCE ISIS HAVE WE SEEN THIS
KIND OF DEPRAVITY, AND WE WILL
CONTINUE TO STAND VERY
RESOLUTELY AGAINST IT.
WHEN I'M IN ISRAEL, I'LL HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU,
PRESIDENT HERZOG, OTHER SENIOR
OFFICIALS.
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING OUR
EMBASSY TEAM THAT HAS BEEN DOING
TERRIFIC WORK DURING THESE
DIFFICULT DAYS.
WE'RE DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE
THAT ISRAEL GETS EVERYTHING IT
NEEDS TO DEFEND ITSELF, TO
PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY OF ITS
PEOPLE.
ALREADY SIGNIFICANT MILITARY
ASSISTANCE REQUESTED BY ISRAEL
IS ON THE WAY, THAT'S ON TOP OF
EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN
DOING FOR YEARS, INCLUDING WITH
THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING,
NEGOTIATED WI PRESIDENT OBAMA TO
MAKE SURE THAT ISRAEL HAS WHAT
IT NEEDS TO DEFEND ITSELF.
AT THE SAME TIME, WE ANTICIPATE
THERE WILL BE FURTHER NEEDS,
FURTHER REQUESTS.
WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN WORKING
CLOSELY WITH CONGRESS ON THIS,
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO
CONTINUING TO DO THAT TO MAKE
SURE THAT ISRAEL HAS WHAT IT
NEEDS.
SECOND, WE WILL BE REITERATING,
REAFFIRMING THE VERY STRONG
MESSAGE THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS
DELIVERED TO ANY COUNTRY OR ANY
PARTY THAT MIGHT TRY TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, AND
THAT MESSAGE IS DON'T.
THE PRESIDENT HAS DEPLOYED AS
YOU KNOW, THE WORLD'S LARGEST
AIRCRAFT TO THE REGION, IT MAKE
CLEAR OUR INTENT TO DETER ANYONE
CONTEMPLATING FURTHER AGGRESSION
AGAINST ISRAEL.
FINALLY, WE'RE OF COURSE VERY
FOCUSED ON OUR OWN PEOPLE, OUR
OWN CITIZENS.
WE LOST 22 AMERICANS.
THAT NUMBER COULD STILL GO UP
AND IT PROBABLY WILL.
AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE A
NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO REMAIN
UNACCOUNTED.
WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH
THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL TO
DETERMINE THEIR WHEREABOUTS AND
IF THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE
BY HAMAS TO WORK TO SECURE THEIR
RELEASE.
SO ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ON
THE AGENDA OVER THE NEXT DAY OR
