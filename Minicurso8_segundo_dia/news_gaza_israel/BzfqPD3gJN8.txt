How has the news of Islamic State
claiming responsibility for this attack
that took place in Iran?
Sylvia, how is that playing out in the
region?
Sure.
So I think the initially when the attack
happened, Iran said it was because of
its stance on Israel's invasion of Gaza.
It didn't actually directly blame Israel
for it.
So that was seen as kind of a tempered
response.
And now we see this claim from Islamic
State.
So in some ways, that does ease tensions
somewhat because it isn't directly
connected in that sense to the Israel
Hamas war.
But it does still mean that regional
tensions are high.
We also have, you know, these recent
attacks on shipping in the Red Sea that
have been blamed on Iran and Iranian
backed groups like the Houthi fighters
in Yemen.
And the US and its allies have said that
they will act against any further
attacks on international shipping in the
Red Sea.
So tensions do remain high as US
Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due
to arrive here soon.
Yeah.
So when I was going to ask you about
that.
So he's due to arrive in the region.
What's his priority on this trip and
what does he hope to achieve?
It's his.
He's had several trips to the region.
He's often he's been in Israel to
reiterate the message that the US
understands that Israel's aim is to
destroy Hamas in Gaza, but that Israel
needs to do more to protect civilian
lives in a conflict that's claimed tens
of thousands of lives so far.
He's also traveling to different
countries in the region.
He'll be
it's a kind of trying to counter this
idea that the war could spread and to
see what could be the day after for
Gaza, what that would look like and how
countries in the region will play a part
in that.
So I think it's, again, about the
conflict
happening in Gaza, the future of Gaza,
and also about the need to avert a wider
conflict spreading throughout the Middle
East now.
