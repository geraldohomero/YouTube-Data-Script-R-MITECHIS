>> Bill: ISRAEL PUSHING FORWARD 
IN ITS MISSION TO DEFEAT HAMAS, 
IDF HAS ENTERED GAZA'S SECOND 
LARGEST CITY KHAN YOUNIS IN THE 
SOUTH NEAR THE MEDITERRANEAN 
SEAT.
TREY YENGST, MORE FROM SOUTHERN 
ISRAEL.
WE WERE TOLD THERE WOULD BE A 
GROUND INVASION AND THAT'S 
HAPPENING.
HELLO AND GOOD EVENING THERE.
>> GOOD MORNING.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
ISRAELI FORCES ARE RAMPING UP 
THEIR STRIKES AGAINST THE 
ENTIRETY OF THE GAZA STRIP 
HITTING MORE THAN 250 TARGETS 
OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS.
WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT ISRAELI 
INFANTRY TROOPS ARE OPERATING 
ONCE AGAIN ON THE GROUND IN 
SOUTHERN GAZA.
THEY ARE GOING HOUSE TO HOUSE 
AND HAVE LOCATED MORE WEAPONS, 
ROCKETS, EXPLOSIVES AND TUNNEL 
SHAFTS.
ISRAELIS ALSO TARGETED THE 
LAUNCHING SITES RESPONSIBLE FOR 
A BARRAGE OF ROCKETS THAT HIT 
TEL AVIV YESTERDAY.
INSIDE GAZA THE DEATH TOLL 
CONTINUES TO RISE.
ISRAELI STRIKE AGAINST CENTRAL 
GAZA KILLED MULTIPLE 
PALESTINIANS YESTERDAY.
YOU CAN SEE IN THE AFTER MATH 
COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF 
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THAT SECOND 
LARGEST CITY OF KHAN YOUNIS.
ISRAEL IS GATHERING INTELLIGENCE
ON THE HOSTAGES INSIDE GAZA.
WE SPOKE WITH A MAN WHOSE TWO 
SISTERS WERE HELD BY HAMAS ALONG
WITH THREE NIECES AND DISCUSSED 
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TERROR THEY 
FACED.
>> THEY HEARD THE BOMBINGS THAT 
WAS PART OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT 
THE FACT THAT THEY WERE 
FORGOTTEN BECAUSE HAMAS TOLD 
THEM THESE THINGS.
ISRAEL GAVE UP ON YOU.
THEY ARE SAYING THEY ARE GOING 
TO FLATTEN GAZA.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
THEY'LL PROBABLY KILL YOU IN ONE
OF THEIR BOMBINGS.
>> HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW IS STILL 
BEING HELD BY HAMAS INSIDE GAZA.
HIS FAMILY WILL NOT BE WHOLE 
UNTIL HE IS HO
