STUART: I GOT IT, MATT FINN.
THANKS VERY MUCH, INDEED.
THERE WERE PROTESTS IN LONDON
TOO.
ONE PERSON AT THE PROTEST WAS
SEEN MAKING WHAT APPEARED TO BE
A PRO-ISIS GESTURE WITH HIS
HANDS.
NIGEL FARAGE BACK WITH US THIS
MORNING.
YOU SAY THESE PROTESTS -- YOU
CALL THEM PRO-HAMAS
CELEBRATIONS, RIGHT?
IT SEEMS LIKE HAMAS HAS GOT A
LOT OF SUPPORT IN LONDON.
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.
THE GLOBAL MEDIA USED THE WORD
PROTEST.
THEY GENUINELY WERE
CELEBRATIONS.
IT WAS LIKE YOUR SOCCER TEAM HAD
JUST WON A BIG GAME.
EVERYONE WAS OUT CHEERING,
THINKING IT WAS MARVELOUS.
SLOGANS, DIVISIVE IMAGES, THE
ISIS FINGER WAS SEEN ON THE
STREETS OF LONDON.
A LOT OF PEOPLE, I'M AFRAID THE
REASON IS VERY SIMPLE.
WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE LIVING
IN THE U.K. WHO ARE SUPPORTERS
OF RADICAL ISLAM.
AND THE IRONY IN ALL OF THIS, I
MEAN, IF I STOOD OUTSIDE A
MOSQUE TONIGHT AND SHOUTED
ANTI-ISLAMIC SLOGANS, HATEFUL
SLOGAN REQUESTS, I WOULD BE
ARRESTED BY THE POLICE WITHIN 10
MINUTES AND CHARGED WITH SOME
SORT OF HATE CRIME.
WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS
OUTRIGHT RACISM AGAINST THE
JEWISH PEOPLE, AND AT THE MINUTE
I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THE BRITISH
POLICE ARE TURNING A BLIND EYE.
STUART: THAT THAT'S JUST NOT
GOOD.
I HEARD THERE MAY BE SOME FINES
LEVY ISED ON PRO- LEVIED ON
PRO-HAS MA -- HAMAS SUPPORTERS
IF THEY SAID SOMETHING.
IS THAT ACCURATE?
I HEARD A VAGUE REPORT ABOUT
THIS.
>> YES.
I MEAN, HAMAS, AS WITH ISIS, ARE
PROVIBE -- PROVIBED
ORGANIZATIONS -- PROSCRIBED
ORGANIZATIONS.
IF YOU SPEAK UP ON THEIR BEHALF,
YOU ARE SUPPORTING TERRORISM,
YOU ARE BREAKING THE LAW.
NOW, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY THERE'S
A FINE POINT HERE.
OUR HOME SECRETARY HAS SAID TO
THE POLICE IF YOU SEE OVERT
PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR HAMAS, YOU
JUST INTERVENE.
FRANKLY, A COUPLE
