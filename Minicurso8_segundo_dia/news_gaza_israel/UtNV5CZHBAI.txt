it's the time of year when New York's
Fifth Avenue is normally bustling with
Christmas
[Applause]
shoppers but for many here the war and
the ever increasing death toll in Gaza
is front of mind more than two months of
Israeli air strikes and a ground

future research shows those issues are
strongly influencing how Americans feel
about the war and the Biden

uh package support package to Israel

weather the storm internationally but I
think also there are those domestic
protests against netanyahu's government
that may uh Place increased pressure on
the go on his government to actually do
something positive towards uh getting a
ceasefire with
Hamas it appears unlikely that will
happen soon with the Israeli Prime
Minister vowing to continue fighting
until Hamas is no more Christina harism
