>> Ainsley: ISRAEL REPORTEDLY
CONSIDERED CARRYING OUT A
COUNTER STRIKE AGAINST IRAN ON
MONDAY BUT DECIDED TO WAIT.
>> Brian: YUP.
TREY YINGST IS LIVE IN TEL AVIV
TO TELL US WHEN YOU WERE STRIKE.
>> YEAH GUYS, GOOD MORNING,
ISRAELI FORCES REMAIN ON HIGH
ALERT ACROSS THE COUNTRY WAITING
FOR ORDERS FROM THE COUNTRY'S
WAR CABINET TO STRIKE BACK
AGAINST IRAN.
REPORTS INDICATE THAT STRIKES
AGAINST THE ISLAM REPUBLIC WERE
CALLED OFF ON TWO SEPARATE
OCCASIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
DAYS.
WE DO KNOW THE ISRAELIS ARE
WAITING FOR THE RIGHT
OPERATIONAL WINDOW TO RESPOND TO
THE DRONE AND MISSILE ATTACK
OVER THE WEEKEND.
IRAN'S TOP OFFICIALS ARE
THREATENING IMMEDIATE
RETALIATION IF SUCH A STRIKE
TAKES PLACE FORCING THE ISRAELIS
TO CONSIDER THE JEWISH HOLIDAY
OF PASSOVER THAT STARTS ON
MONDAY.
WITH THAT IN MIND, THE ISRAELI
ARMY IS GETTING READY FOR THE
POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER IRANIAN
ATTACK.
WITH A DIRECT ATTACK FROM IRAN
PENDING, ISRAEL STILL CONTINUING
TO STRIKE IRAN'S LARGEST PROXY
IN THE REGION, HEZBOLLAH.
YESTERDAY, ISRAEL STRUCK DEEP
INSIDE LEBANON TARGETING LESSENS
AIR KEVIN'S UNITS, DRONE ATTACK

CIVILIANS IN NORTHERN ISRAEL.
ON CERTAIN DAYS AHEAD IN THE
REGION, AS THE BIDEN

ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU.
GUYS, BACK TO YOU.
>> Brian: HEY, TREY, THEY DID
TAKE OUT TWO HEZBOLLAH LEADERS,
IS THAT RELATED TO THE
RETALIATION IN ANY WAY, DO YOU
THINK?
>> IT IS THE ISRAELIS ARE TRYING
TO SEND A MESSAGE TO HEZBOLLAH
THAT IF THEY GET MORE DIRECTLY
INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT AND TARGET
MAJOR ISRAELI POPULATION
CENTERS, THEY WILL BE A HEAVY
