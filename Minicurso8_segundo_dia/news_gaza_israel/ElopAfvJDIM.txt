>>> JUST MOMENTS AGO, STUDENTS
AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HERE IN
NEW YORK DENOUNCED RECENT ACTS
OF ANTI-SEMITISM ON CAMPUS THAT
THEY SAY HAVE MADE JEWISH AND
ISRAELI STUDENTS FEEL UNSAFE.
AND COLUMBIA IS NOT ALONE.
LAST NIGHT, VIOLENT ANTI-SEMITIC
MESSAGES POSTED ONLINE FORCED
CORNELL UNIVERSITY
ADMINISTRATORS TO ALERT THE FBI
AND SEND CAMPUS POLICE TO GUARD
A JEWISH CENTER.
NBC'S STEPHANIE GOSK IS
FOLLOWING ALL OF THIS FOR US.
STEPHANIE, WHAT DID YOU HEAR
FROM STUDENTS AT COLUMBIA?
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, CHRIS,
IT'S BECOMING A COMMON REFRAIN,
NOT JUST HERE AT COLUMBIA, BUT
AT A NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES IN

ANTI-SEMITISM, VIOLENCE, THREATS
OF VIOLENCE ONLINE.
THERE'S ONE INCIDENT WHERE AN
ISRAELI STUDENT IS POSTING
POSTERS OF THE HOSTAGES TAKEN IN
ISRAEL AND WAS ATTACKED.
THAT PERSON IS NOW FACING FOUR

TWO OF THEM ARE FOR HATE CRIMES.
THERE WAS ALSO A SWASTIKA THAT
WAS PAINTED ON THE SIDE OF THE
BUILDING.
THE STUDENTS BASICALLY SAYING
THEY WANT THE UNIVERSITY TO DO
MORE THAN WHAT IT'S DOING.
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT ONE OF
THEM HAD TO SAY.
>> WHILE THE STATEMENTS
CONDEMNING IDENTITY BASED HOPE,
GAVE STUDENTS HOPE THE
ADMINISTRATION WOULD TAKE
CONCRETE ACTIONS.
THE UNIVERSITY'S ACTIONS HAVE
MADE US QUESTION WHETHER
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAN ACTUALLY
MAINTAIN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE
ALL STUDENTS FEEL WELCOME AND
SAFE ON CAMPUS.
THIS HATE WILL NOT DISAPPEAR ON
ITS OWN.
>> Reporter: SO ONE OF THE
POINTS THAT THESE STUDENTS MADE
WHAT THEY WERE TALKING HERE
TODAY IS IT IS NOT JUST
ANTI-SEMITISM.
THERE HAS BEEN ISLAMOPHOBIA AS
WELL.
BECAUSE OF THESE INCIDENTS, THEY
ARE UNABLE TO HOLD THE KIND OF
