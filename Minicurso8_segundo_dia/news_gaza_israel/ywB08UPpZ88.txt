the US military says a drone which hit a
chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean last
night was launched from Iran Iran has
been accused of backing houthi rebels in
Yemen who've been attacking shipping in
the Red Sea in recent weeks the US says
it's also shot down four drones in the

establishing a coalition to patrol the
Red Sea to protect what it calls a
threat to global trade not just Israel's
the houthis aren't attacking just one
country they're really attacking the
International Community uh they they are
attacking the economic well-being and
prosperity of Nations around the
world the sophistication of houthi

attackers themselves is already having
an impact hundreds of ships have been
diverted from the area at extra cost to
owners and customers alike but despite
such attacks and Rising tensions both
