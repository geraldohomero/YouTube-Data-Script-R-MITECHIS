We find you Pauline Godar you are
Our special envoy in such an opinion you
were live yesterday at the same time
But today the scenario is not
The same truce has not been renewed
we imagine that we talk a lot about it in
Israeli streets where you
Find yes listen to what happened
This is what about 1h before the end of
the truce, that is to say, about 6 hours from the
morning Israeli time and the
sirens sounded in several
cities that run along the forehead with the band
of Gaza of cities like Zderot Ibim
Niram and we were also able to
note that these sirens have been able to
sound since we have on our
mobile phones you know
several applications that
allow us to warn us
When sirens sound in particular
To be shelled we could
note that these sirens and well these
alerts had been numerous on our
phones at least several dozen
So it is true that the army
Israeli announces this morning that the
Hamas broke this agreement this truce that
The fighting resumed the fights on
the terrain inside the band of
Gaza Israel also announces that she has
bombarded the band several times
of Gaza and especially in the south of the
Gaza band here is what said
exactly the cabinet of the first
Minister Benyamin Netaniaahou Hamas has
violated the main lines it does not have
respected his obligation to release all
The hostages in particular all women
And all children and make this
that Gaza is never a
threat to Israel residents for
residents of Gazaoui so we have
decided to resume the fights and we
are determined to reach our
objective which is therefore to release all
The hostages release the Gaza Strip from
Hamas then during these 7 days of truce
It can be noted that 240 prisoners
Palestinians were released by
Israelis in exchange for around 80
hostages these are Israelis but also
binational children of children and
Young people under 19 Israeli
obligal I was telling you then
behind the scenes negotiations we have
learned continue to continue the
Qataris but also the Egyptians are
always at work to try to put
again a truce in place and they
would like this of course that this
if a truce is again put again
in place that it allows release
new ages since a hundred
more than a hundred more than 150 hostages
approximately are always in the hands of
Hamas at present mainly
now men but also
Israeli soldiers
