 
THE LAW IS SET TO TAKE EFFECT 
IN MARCH. 
CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS ARE ALREADY 
CHALLENGING THE LAW IMPORT. 
>>> WE HAVE LEARNED AS SEVEN -- 
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN WOMAN, 
WAS ACTUALLY KILLED DURING THE 
INITIAL ATTACK. 
AND ISRAELI SPOKESPERSON SAYS 
IT IS BELIEVED THAT JUDY 
WEINSTEIN'S BODY WAS TAKEN INTO 
GAZA AFTER SHE WAS KILLED ON 
OCTOBER 7th. 
OFFICIALS CONCERNED LAST WEEK 
HER HUSBAND WAS ALSO KILLED 
DURING THE ATTACK, HIS BODY IS 
ALSO BELIEVED TO BE IN GAZA. 
>>> SHARMA KHALIL JOINTLY FROM 
JERUSALEM WITH MORE. 
THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE IDF 
EXPANDING ITS GROUND OFFENSIVE 
NEAR REFUGEE CAMPS IN GAZA. 
WHERE ARE THOSE CIVILIANS GOING?
>> THAT IS THE REALLY DIFFICULT 
QUESTION. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN AREA 
THAT IS DENSELY POPULATED, 
NEARLY THREE REFUGEE CAMPS IN 
GAZA. THESE ARE THE AREAS THAT 
WILL BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED. 
THE U.N. AGENCIES ARE SAYING 
ABOUT 150,000 PEOPLE ARE NOW 
AFFECTED, PEOPLE ARE ON THE 
MOVE. 
KEEP IN MIND, MANY PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE TAKEN SHELTER IN THESE 
CAMPS HAVE BEEN FLEEING IN THE 
NORTH. 
THEY WILL BE TWICE DISPLACED. 
OF THE PROBLEM IS, AS THEY GO 
FURTHER SOUTH, THEY ARE BEING 
MET WITH FURTHER BOMBARDMENT. 
AS THE MILITARY OFFENSIVE 
CONTINUES TO DEEPEN, GAZANS ARE 
RUNNING OUT OF PLACE TO GO. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DEADLY 
CHRISTMAS REFUGEE STRIKE. 
WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW? 
>> THAT IS RIGHT. 
WE HEARD FROM AN ISRAELI 
MILITARY OFFICIAL TONIGHT, HE 
SAID THE WRONG MUNITION WAS 
USED. 
IT WAS ONE OF THE THREE REFUGEE 
CAMPS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT, 
THAT HAPPEN ON CHRISTMAS EVE. 
BETWEEN 70 AND 86 PEOPLE WERE 
KILLED IN THAT STRIKE. 
THE NUMBER IS LIKELY TO RISE 
BECAUSE BODIES ARE STILL BEING 
PULLED FROM THE RUBBLE. 
THE ISRAELI OFFICIALS SAID THEY 
STRUCK TWO ADJACENT AREAS WHERE 
HAMAS OPERATIVES WERE. AND 
OTHER BUILDINGS WERE HIT. 
HE SAID THE MUNITION DID NOT 
MATCH THE PARTICULAR STRIKE. 
HE SAID THEY REGRETTED THAT 
PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT INVOLVED 
WERE KILLED IN THIS EXTENSIVE 
COLLATERAL DAMAGE. IN THEI
