Since the Palestinian militant group Hamas  
launched an attack on Israel at the start 
of October, the role of crypto in funding  
militant groups and terror organisations 
has really come into the spotlight. 
Hamas itself has been known to raise money via 
cryptocurrencies over the past few weeks. The  
Israelis have frozen several cryptocurrency 
wallets it said were linked to Hamas. 
Many people say that crypto is an 
extremely useful tool for these  
kinds of organisations. It's largely anonymous.
The money that anyone sends over the blockchain,  
that's the technology that underpins 
cryptocurrency, is usually just  
identified by a string of letters and numbers.
It's difficult to track and this means that for  
militant groups or terrorists seeking to raise 
money, crypto has become a very popular tool. 
Now it's not completely anonymous 
cryptocurrency companies. 
That means exchanges as well as 
law enforcement organisations can  
actually work out who is sending the 
money, who is sending the crypto. But  
it takes a bit of work for them to do that.
Nobody knows for sure exactly how much money  
terrorist groups raise by crypto.
The United Nations official said  
in 2022 that about 5% of terror attacks were 
considered to be financed by cryptocurrencies. 
A variety of cryptocurrencies are 
known to be used by terrorist groups  
and militant groups to raise funds.
While Bitcoin is popular, stablecoins  
– that's a type of cryptocurrency 
that's designed to keep a very 
steady value – have become 
more popular in recent years. 
There are also a number of other sources 
that these groups use to raise funds. That's  
anything from charities, shell companies, 
investments overseas to also raise funds. 
So crypto is definitely part of the mix. But it's 
very difficult to say exactly what proportion.
