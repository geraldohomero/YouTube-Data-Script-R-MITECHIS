left in Gaza to take them 10 hospitals
remain open but on the verge of collapse
lacking critical supplies and staff
alifa was the largest and most advanced
Medical Facility in Gaza the World
Health organization's senior most
representative there says that while
many are focused on the deaths and
injuries caused by the bombardments the
Public Health crisis caused by the

resuscitate these hospitals to continue
providing Services obviously in the in
the current context that is difficult
and we do need to get patients who
require urgent and critical care to that
care uh but at the same time we're

provide uh Ser services to the
population that remain North in those
hospitals what is clear is that we have
