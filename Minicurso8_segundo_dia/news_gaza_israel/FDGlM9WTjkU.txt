As the death toll in
GASA continues to increase democrats in
United States are losing the
patience the leader of the majority in the
Senate Chu Schumer had some words
strong for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netyahu even asking
new elections in
Israel 5 months after this conflict
It is clear that Israelis need
take stock of the situation and
ask yourself, we must change the course in
This critical situation I think a
new choice is the only way to
Allow a healthy and open decision
He is not the first Democrat who condemns the
Netanyahu Biden leadership in the
past has also made warnings
But the most recent speech is equivalent to
the hardest critic until now of a
High elected official of states
United as the Jewish official of more
high rank in the country so far
had positioned himself as a strong
Israeli government ally the leader of
The republican minority in the Senate
Mitch McConnell cataloged the
Schumer statements as
Grotescas do not make mistakes the game
Democrat does not have a Nahu problem
has a problem against Israel Israel no
It is a United States colony whose
leaders serve at the will of the party in
The power in
Washington the Netyahu game
responded quickly to
Comments Israel is a democracy
Independent and proud who chose
Netanyahu Prime Minister not a
Banana republic contrary to
SHOMER WORDS The Israeli public
support a complete victory over ever
reject any international dictation
To establish a terrorist state
Palestine and opposes the return of the
Palestinian authority to Gaza the overwhelming
majority of Americans considered
horrible the attack of ever on
October but in an AP survey of
end of January found that half
of Americans thought that
Israel's military campaign had gone
too far the United States still
supplies Israel weapons but
presidential elections approaching the
unwavering support to Israel could
alienate apart from the electoral base of
Biden
