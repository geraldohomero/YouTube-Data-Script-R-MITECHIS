ctv's paul workman is standing by in
london with more on this
paul hello to you the military says it
is now
in control what's the latest that we're
hearing out of myanmar this morning and
and really how did we get to this point
it's a sorry return to military rule
absolutely after this experiment in
partial democracy anyway the community
communications in the country were down
for part of the day
on internet telephones the airport's
been closed
people are still out in the streets
they're buying groceries in large
amounts worried about what might happen
in the days to come if not even longer
than that
yes a lot of people in detention the
president and aung san tsuchi
has been taken into custody and nobody's
really
sure where and how this is now going to
play out the military says it's taken
over for
one year and that it will restore
elections at some point but
there are many people doubting uh and
wondering exactly
why this happened now and where it will
lead
how are global leaders reacting to the
news of this coup mm-hmm well
it's been very much widely condemned by
what the
the western world certainly the prime
minister of britain
the secretary of state and state in the
united states
and a lot of other european leaders as
well and again it's because
it looked as if myanmar was on track to
as i say at least have some
partial democracy the generals had given
up power
to allow elections aung san tsuchi's
party won the largest number
of seats in two elections and then all
of a sudden the hammer has come down
again
and people aren't really sure exactly
why the military would choose now to do
it because the elections were
embarrassing
certainly for the military their the
party they back did so poorly
but at the same time the military didn't
lose any power it still controls the
ministries and
the most important ministries in the
country and it still has a guarantee of
25 of the seats in parliament so
why do it now is a large a very large
question that many people in the
international community
are asking all right we're watching it
paul workman in london for us this
morning paul thank you
