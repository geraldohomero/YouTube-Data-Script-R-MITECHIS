Well we are now live in strip
of gauze to show reality
harsh reality of what you are living
In hospitals where clearly
These last days he toured the worst
Information not beyond being
collapsed of people huh they run out of
supplies and reached the limit of having
that even operating children Pablo without
anesthesia imagine the situation
desperate not to be living
There every vehicle that arrives is a
wounded who goes down is a person who
We need medical assistance we are in
I live so the fault of
This is the door of a hospital in the
Gaza strip This is reality
that you are happening you observe it in
First person you are located in the
Gaza Strip following this image in
I live at the door of a hospital where
private cars ambulances
Trucks all kinds of vehicles
This place arrives in search of relief
And how well you told the difficult
situation to face the lack of
inputs exactly with all that this
entails not clearly have in
account that there are a lot of people who
They have nothing to do with all this and what
They really need assistance as
In this particular case as we speak
of the boys not that arrive in the
Worst conditions to these hospitals
that have already suspended all kinds of
activity the only thing they are doing is
What has to do with emergencies
clearly good protecting the
doctors or having them
By the time the extreme cases arrive
Like what we were talking about just
Let us agree and place noos in what
It has to do with people who suddenly
You need even an amputation and they are
making barely sedated in some cases
or just even and without anesthesia and
No anesthesia in the absence of inputs
that are in hospitals in strip of
also with this situation this
antecedent
of the fall of a missile in a
hospital that antecedent that
obviously makes them work under a
tension status
East depression and fear and also good
place the medical assistance for
Above your own security no
we are exactly live showing you
Then the unfortunate panorama that
is living in the Middle East in Strip
Gaza in the hospitals collapse
that in the absence of inputs they attend to
The injured that arrive in the worst
conditions of the world and how we told you
just until they operate without
anesthesia
