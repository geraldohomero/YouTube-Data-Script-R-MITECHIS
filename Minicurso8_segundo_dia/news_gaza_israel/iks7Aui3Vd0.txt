THAT IS HOW THIS RACE IS SETTING
UP.
ALL THE OUTSIDE GROUPS WILL TRY
TO TACKLE THIS DISTRICT.
>> FORMER CONGRESSMAN DAVID
JOLLY, CAN YOU STAY WITH US,
DAVID?
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME BREAKING
NEWS AND I WANT TO GET YOUR
THOUGHTS ON IT ON THE OTHER
SIDE.
IT COMES TO US OUT OF ISRAEL
WHERE IDF SPOKESMAN DANIEL HAGAR
REE HAS JUST ANNOUNCED ISRAEL IS
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT
IT CALLS THE ACCIDENTAL DEATH OF
THREE HOSTAGES.
NBC'S HALA GORANI HAS MORE FOR
US.
WHAT DO WE OW, HALA?
>> Reporter: YEAH, WE'RE JUST
LOOKING THROUGH THAT FULL IDF
STATEMENT FOR YOU, CHRIS.
IT APPEARS THAT DURING A COMBAT
OPERATION IN THE GAZA STRIP, THE
IDF, THE ISRAELI MILITARY
MISTAKENLY SHOT AND KILLED THREE
HOSTAGES THAT WERE TRYING TO
FLEE.
THEIR BODIES, WE'RE BEING TOLD,
WERE TRANSFERRED TO ISRAELI
TERRITORY FOR EXAMINATION, AND
IT'S UPON EXAMINATION OF THE
BODIES THAT THEY DETERMINED THAT
THEY WERE THREE ISRAELI HOSTAGES
INSIDE OF GAZA, PERHAPS AS I
MENTIONED THERE, ATTEMPTING TO
RUN AWAY FROM THEIR CAPTORS.
THE ISRAELI MILITARY MIGHT HAVE
CONFUSED THEM WITH HAMAS AND AT
THAT POINT CAME AT THEM AND SHOT
THEM.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT TWO OF THE
HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN NAMED, ONE
WAS KIDNAPPED ON OKTSCTOBER 7th.
THE OTHER KIDNAPPED ALSO ON
OCTOBER 7th.
THE THIRD HOSTAGE NOT NAMED AT
THE REQUEST OF THE FAMILY OF
THAT INDIVIDUAL.
THEY HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED, THOUGH,
SO ALL FAMILIES, THE THREE
FAMILIES OF THOSE THREE
INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED
OF THE DEATHS OF THEIR
RELATIVES, AND YOU CAN IMAGINE
KNOWING THAT UP UNTIL VERY
RECENTLY THEY HAD MANAGED TO
SURVIVE INSIDE THE GAZA STRIP IN
HAMAS CAPTIVITY AND THAT
EVENTUALLY THEY ENDED UP BEING
KILLED BY FRIENDLY FIRE.
THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED AS WELL,
AS YOU MENTIONED BY DANIEL
HAGARI, WHO'S THE IDF
SPOKESPERSON.
I'M READING THIS A LITTLE COLD,
CHRIS, I APOLOGIZE IF I'M
LOOKING DOWN QUITE A BIT.
DANIEL HAGARI SAYS WE ESTIMATE
THE THREE ISRAELIS EITHER FLED
OR WERE ABANDONED BY THE
TERRORISTS WHO HELD THEM
CAPTIVE, AND DURING THE LAST FEW
DAYS OR THIS DAY THEY REACHED
THE POINT THAT THEY REACHED, AND
THAT IS WHERE, UNFORTUNATELY AS
A RESULT OF FRIENDLY FIRE, THEY
WERE KILLED, CHRIS.
THIS IS WHAT WE CAN SHARE WITH
YOU AT THIS STAGE AS WE CONTINUE
