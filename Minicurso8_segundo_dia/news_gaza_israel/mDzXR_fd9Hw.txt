with graphic images of those injured in
the
violence horror at gaza's largest
[Music]
hospital bodies flood the floor of
alifa up to 50,000 people were
Sheltering here when it was struck
a precarious Health System pummeled
patients killed for Palestinians it's
known as the house of healing for Israel
it's the Hub of
Hamas and for one Doctor Who's been
working inside it is now totally
broken this is the darkest hour this is
by far the darkest hour it's gone
there's no medical system Shi has gone
that was a third of the system all of
the children's hospitals have been
attacked and put out of service uh the
cancer hospital has been put out of
service the psychiatric hospital has
been put out of service the obic
hospital has been put out of service
there's nothing left in the whole
northern part of Gaza I don't know who's
left inside shifa uh but I'm sure
there's thousands who can never be moved
the Israelis continue to claim that
militants are operating from inside
these hospitals is that
correct absolutely not I mean we can see
it mean this hospital is an open plan
Hospital you can see there's no no one
there's no one here other than the the
the wounded their families and some kids
trying to get hold of some drinking
water because we have a drinking water
pipe they're absolutely terrified that
they've been targeting the hospit the
school but nowhere and no one is
insulated from this
war here Israeli tanks roll ominously
past Al rantisi children's
hospital and just across the road even
those waving White Flags can't
escape met instead with gunfire at the
gates of Al NASA
hospital as death and despair rain in
the North thousands try to flee
South a mass of humanity Clinging On to
each other dragging themselves to
safety last night I wasn't optimistic
that any of my children or I would come
out unharmed given the intensity of the
bombing and gunfire we couldn't wait for
the morning and everyone and sheeper
Hospital
LIF it is a life of fear by day and
night Cordelia Lynch Sky News Jerusalem
