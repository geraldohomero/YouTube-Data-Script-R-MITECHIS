LUCAS TOMLINSON, THANK YOU, ON 
NANTUCKET.
ARTHEL, OVER TO YOU.
>> Arthel: TREY YINGST IS IN 
SOUTHERN ISRAEL AND AS LUCAS 
JUST SAID, THE PRESIDENT HAD 
SOME OFF THE CUFF FORCEFUL WORDS
WE JUST HEARD AND HE DID TOUT 
THAT BRIDGE AS I SAID BETWEEN 
SAUDI ARABIA AND AMERICA TO HAVE
ISRAEL WALK OVER FOR PEACE DEAL 
AND THAT HE SAYS THAT I CAN'T 
CONFIRM IT, THAT IS WHY HE 
BELIEVES HAMAS STRUCK WHEN THEY 
DID.
TREY.
>> YEAH, ARTHEL, AS PRESIDENT 
BIDEN WAS SPEAKING, AT AN AIR 
BASE BEHIND ME, SOME OF THOSE 
HOSTAGES THAT WERE RELEASED BACK
INTO ISRAELI CUSTODY WERE 
RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT 
BEFORE HEADING ON TO HOSPITALS 
IN CENTRAL ISRAEL.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S 
COMMENTS, THERE IS STILL A HUGE 
DIVIDE IN HOW THE AMERICANS SEE 
THIS MOVING FORWARD AND HOW THE 
ISRAELIS SEE THIS MOVING 
FORWARD.
PRESIDENT BIDEN THERE TOUTING 
THE DIPLOMACY AND RIGHTFULLY SO,
THE QATARIS WERE ABLE TO CUT A 
DEAL BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS TO
GET THE FIRST GROUP OF HOSTAGES 
OUT AND IF IT GOES FORWARD AS 
PLANNED, YOU'LL SEE A FOUR-DAY 
CEASEFIRE WILL END IN 50 
RELEASED FROM GAZA IN EXCHANGE 
FOR 150 PRISONERS RELEASED BY 
THE ISRAELIS.
THE QUESTION IS NOT ABOUT THIS 
CEASEFIRE.
THE QUESTION IS ABOUT WHAT COMES
NEXT, THE DAY AFTER THE 
CEASEFIRE, WHAT WILL THAT LOOK 
LIKE, AND THE REALITY ON THE 
GROUND IS THAT THE IDEA OF A 
LONG-TERM TRUCE OR ABILITY TO 
HAVE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS
A GREAT IDEA IN COMMENT, BUT IN 
PRACTICE IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT 
AND WE SAW THIS ALL PLAY OUT 
OVER THE PAST NEARLY 50 DAYS, 
AND SO THIS IS REALLY WHAT WE 
ARE LOOKING AT IN THE COMING 
DAYS AND WEEKS, PART OF THAT 
DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMEN
