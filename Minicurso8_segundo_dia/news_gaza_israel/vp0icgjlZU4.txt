in ral's al-manara square another rally
against Israeli
occupation against the backdrop of the
Gaza War simmering tensions have again
caught
fire life is very hard here for example
we can't go out because of the
checkpoints and roadblocks and we're
constantly worried we could be killed at
any
time deadly violence has flared across
the West Bank over the last 2 weeks in

three people to clashes with nearby
Israeli

day yaser's father and brother were also
killed what yasa told us is that a
settler who was in the car shot at his
father and his brother who was also
driving the settler didn't see that yasa
was in the back we found the bullets in
the the car my brother and his son Ahmed
weren't affiliated with fata or with
Hamas that had no relation with

violence the Israeli Army has opened an
investigation into events in
KRA less than half an hour away Israeli
settlers are digging in fearing for
their own safety amid the upswing in
violence not something to do Shilo
decided to teach his wife Nomi to use
his pistol once the War
Began this is a weapon I received from
the Army because of the security
situation it's for reservists for those
who haven't been called up in my
everyday life I have a pistol I don't
usually walk around with it but now I
do this is our land I don't think the
Palestinians should feel safe here it's
always being the Arabs who starts by
killing Jews
always according to Israeli NGO balm

least 98 Palestinian families have left
their homes since October 7th
