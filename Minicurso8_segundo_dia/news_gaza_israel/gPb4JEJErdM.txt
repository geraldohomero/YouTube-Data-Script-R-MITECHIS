Constant Israel from Hamas Gaza
Thousands after another in southern cities
Number is attacking the missile
The question arises that people protect themselves
How are we at this time in the city of Jero
That there is no one in the city
Except for a few people but this
Time we are at a bus stand and bus
We are that structure next to the stand
People who show people from Hamas missiles
Saves the southern city of Israel to the city
It saves people, it is bunker in it
Bunker is mostly public
Bus stander people bus next to sites
Stand to catch so it
Bunker made here whenever missile alert
People come and run into this bunker
This bunker is of concrete of concrete and
Hamas
It will not affect it here
There are at least 15 to 20 people here
Can live together because less population
If there is a city then a lot of people on the streets
Most public at a time
Such structure in the middle of sites
This is made of concrete, this concrete is made
Is made up and it is a wall in the middle
It is so that the missile cracked when the splunter torn
If the rocket torn, splunter then here
Apart from this, you should stay inside
Apart from this, this gate is also made of iron
People shut down by closing
If no linter is able to come in
The bunkers are usually made up
Bunkers are made inside the ground but this
Different bunkers built up in public places
Are and which are houses in houses
Undergrounds are made if
If the missile falls, people go inside and hide
Such bunker and safe zone it is safe zone
It is said that we also report many times
When the missile alert is done during
Go to these bunkers and secure yourself
Have done the biggest
Does thousands of missiles finally
It is staining from Hamas Gaza
Bunker who saves people missiles
Falls on the ground or on the building but
People enter these bunkers and save their lives
That is why loss of life and property from missile
There is little less that is target
