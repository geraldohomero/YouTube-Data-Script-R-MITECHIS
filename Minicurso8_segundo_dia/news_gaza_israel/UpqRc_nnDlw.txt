Gazza today has become the moral compass
of the
World Gazza was held before October 7th
and the world was
silent should we be surprised that
they're silence
now if you are not appalled by what is
happening in Gaza if you are not shaken
to your core there is something wrong
with your
humanity and if we as Christians are not
outraged by the genocide by the
weaponization of the Bible to just
testify it there is something wrong with
our Christian witness and we are
compromising The credibility of Our
Gospel
message if you fail to call this a
genocide it is on

ceasefire I'm talking about
churches I feel sorry for you we will be
okay
despite the immense blow we have endured
we the Palestinians will
recover we will rise we will stand up
again from the midst of Destruction as
we have always done as
Palestinians although this is by far
maybe the biggest blow we have received
in a long time but we will be
