WITH YOU THE OUTLOOK FOR CLOUDS
IN THE SKY FOR THAT MONDAY BIG
MONDAY SEVEN DAY FORECAST IN
JUST A FEW MINUTES. ALL RIGHT
DAN, THANKS. SEE YOU SOON.
ISRAEL SAYS IT IS WORKING ON
INCREASING THE FLOW OF
HUMANITARIAN AID INTO GAZA,
CROSSING IN THE NORTH. IT COMES
JUST HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN
TOLD ISRAEL THAT FUTURE U.S.
SUPPORT FOR THE WAR DEPENDS ON
ISRAEL DOING MORE TO PROTECT
CIVILIANS AND AID WORKERS. FOX'S
CONNER HANSON HAS OUR STORY. ON
THE HEELS OF AN ISRAELI STRIKE
THAT KILLED SEVEN AID WORKERS IN
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HE
HAS TO TAKE MORE STEPS TO KEEP
CIVILIANS SAFE. THE WHITE HOUSE
HAS IMPLIED FURTHER AID TO
ISRAEL COULD DEPEND ON IT. TOO
MANY CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED,
AND IF WE DON'T SEE THOSE
CHANGES, WELL, THEN WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND
DECISIONS OF OUR OWN. BEFORE THE
CALL, NETANYAHU SPOKE TO MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS SAYING THEY ARE
CLOSE TO VICTORY AND THAT
AMERICA'S SECURITY DEPENDS ON
IT, TOO. THIS IS A BATTLE
BETWEEN NOT ONLY ISRAEL AND
HAMAS, BUT, I WOULD SAY THE
TERROR AXIS OF IRAN THAT SEEKS
TO PUT THE MIDDLE EAST BACK INTO
THE DARK AGES. IN PUBLIC
STATEMENTS, ISRAELI OFFICIALS
ARE SHIFTING THE FOCUS TO IRAN
AND NOT JUST ITS WAR WITH HAMAS.
IRAN VOWED REVENGE AGAINST
ISRAEL AFTER A RECENT AIRSTRIKE
KILLED TOP IRANIAN OFFICIALS IN
SYRIA. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T
ERADICATE HAMAS, IMAGINE WHAT
OUR ENEMIES IN TEHRAN, IN
LEBANON, IN SYRIA, THEY WOULD
COME AGAINST US. SO THAT'S WHY
WE ARE SO DETERMINED TO WIN THIS
WAR. WHILE MANY IN CONGRESS ARE
SUPPORTING BIDEN'S HARDENED
STANCE ON ISRAEL, OTHERS ARE
DOUBLING DOWN ON THEIR SUPPORT.
SOCIAL MEDIA, QUOTE, NO
CONDITIONS FOR ISRAEL. I THINK
WE'VE MADE OUR SUPPORT, LOUD AND
CLEAR AND ON THE RECORD.
A CEASE FIRE AND URGED NETANYAHU
TO WRAP UP HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS.
THE US IS STILL MAKING IT CLEAR
IT SUPPORTS ISRAEL IN NEW YORK.
