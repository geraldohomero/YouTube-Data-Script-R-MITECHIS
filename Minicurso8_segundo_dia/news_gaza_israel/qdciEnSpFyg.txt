As the UN Security Council demanded an 
immediate ceasefire in Gaza on Monday,  
relief for its residents was 
drifting further from reach.
Palestinians are forced to forage for food, 
with famine inching closer in the enclave.
Mohammad Shehadeh says he risks his life 
to scrounge for this leafy wild plant  
known as khobiza, a variety of what 
in English is called common mallow.
He sells it in the market, but that - and 
lemons - are all his own family have to eat.
"My young children ask to eat, but what 
do I have besides khobiza? I cook it,  
and they eat it with spoons, without bread."
It's a similar story for Maryam 
Al-Attar, who says Israelis have  
shot at her and her husband when they 
went to pick khobiza in the east.
"All our lives - even through wars - we have 
not eaten khobiza. My daughters tell me,  
'we want to eat bread, mother.' My heart 
breaks for them. I can't find a piece  
of bread for them. I go and gather some 
khobiza. We have found khobiza for now,  
but in the future, where will we get it from? 
Khobiza will run out. Where do we turn?"
It's also the middle of the holy month of Ramadan,  
when millions of Muslims around the 
world fast from sunrise to sunset,  
before enjoying large dinners with their extended 
families and watching special television shows.
Gazans, however, are fasting on empty 
stomachs, save for some khobiza - for now.
This woman says she and her family are dizzy from  
hunger and consumed by cravings 
for vegetables, fish and meat.
The foraging is another reminder of the 
suffering throughout the Palestinian enclave  
in the five months of war that has followed 
Hamas' bloody October 7 attack on Israel.
In mid-March, the Integrated Food-Security Phase 
Classification, which monitors the world's hunger,  
said famine is imminent and likely 
to occur in northern Gaza by May,  
possibly spreading across the enclave by July.
