S
SINCE THE INVASION BEGAN.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER MÃ‰LANIE
JOLY DISCUSSING THE SANCTIONS A
SHORT TIME AGO.
LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> Reporter: WHAT IS THE POINT
OF GIVING YOURSELF MORE POWER IF
YOU ARE NOT SEIZING ANYTHING?
>> FIRST AND FOREMOST WE HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO, YES, MAKE SURE WE
HAVE STRONG SANCTIONS, WE HAVE
ALSO BEEN ABLE TO ENSURE THAT
THERE WILL NOT BE ANY FORM OF
IMPORTS FROM RUSSIA.
SO WE KNOW ALSO THAT SOME

PLACE, AND THE FEMA LEGISLATION.
BUT WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO GO
FURTHER.
SO THAT IS WHY WE'RE USING THE
ACT IMPLANTED NOW.
TO GO FURTHER.
>> Reporter: HOW MUCH MONEY IS
OUT THERE?
>> I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR
ESTIMATION, I JUST NOTE THE
ASSETS OF RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS IN
CANADA ARE SUBSTANTIAL.
WHAT I CAN SAY THOUGH IS WE KNOW
THAT RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS TEND TO
BE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAN
CANADA, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE
BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE PROXIMITY
AND BECAUSE OF FAMILY LINKS THAT
ARE USUALLY MORE IN EUROPE ARE
SOMETIMES THE UNITED STATES.
AND THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO BE
ABLE TO BRING TH
