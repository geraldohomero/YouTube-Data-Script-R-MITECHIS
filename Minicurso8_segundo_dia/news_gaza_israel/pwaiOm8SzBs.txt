>>> OF THE HOSTAGES TAKEN FROM
ISRAEL BY HAMAS OVER 10% WERE
MIGRANT WORKERS FROM SOUTHEAST
ASIA CAUGHT IN A CONFLICT THEY
NEVER SAW COMING.
NBC'S JAY GRAY HAS THEIR STORY.
>> COMING HOME FOR THE LAST
TIME.
>> I'M VERY SAD.
SO SAD THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING.
I THINK THAT MY SON'S TIME IN
THIS WORLD IS UP.
>> Reporter: HIS FAMILY'S WORLD
SHATTERED.
ON OCTOBER 7th, HE WAS WORKING
AS A FARM HAND AT A KIBBUTZ NEAR
THE GAZA BORDER.
AS HAMAS TERRORISTS STORMED IN.
>> Translator: I HEARD THE NEWS
ABOUT THE ATTACK AND MY HEART
WAS BROKEN.
I KEPT CALLING MY SON AND HE
DIDN'T PICK UP THE PHONE.
>> Reporter: FOR FOUR AND A HALF
YEARS HE WORKED ON A CHICKEN
FARM SENDING MOST OF THE MONEY
HE EARNED BACK TO HIS FAMILY IN
THAILAND.
FUNDS THEY USED TO BUILD A HOUSE
AND BUY A TRACTOR.
>> HE BUILT EVERYTHING AND HE
DID NOT EVEN GET TO TOUCH THEM.
>> Reporter: HE ALSO HELPED PAY
FOR UPKEEP ON THE FAMILY RICE
FARM.
>> I AM SAD AND I CRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WHEN I WALK ALONG THIS RICE
PADDY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
>> HIS PLAN, ACCORDING TO THE
FAMILY WAS TO COME HOME AND WORK
THE LAND SO HIS PARENTS COULD
REST AS THEY GET OLDER.
BUT THERE IS NO REST, NO RELIEF
FROM THEIR OVERWHELMING LOSS.
IN A VILLAGE JUST 50 MILES AWAY,
THERE'S ANOTHER VACANT HOUSE.

ABOUT TO SHATTER.
WHEN I SEE HIS HOUSE, I DON'T
WANT TO COME AND SEE IT ANYMORE.

THIS DREAM HOUSE FOR SON ANUSHA,
HIS WIFE AND YOUNG DAUGHTER,
ANUSHA PAID FOR MATERIALS WITH
MONEY EARNED FROM TWO YEARS OF
WORK IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL'S
AVOCADO FIELD.
HIS FAMILY SAYS HE'S BEEN
MISSING SINCE THE ATTACKS.
>> Translator: I WANT TO CRY.
WHEN I SEE HIS PHOTO, I WANT TO
CRY.
I COULD NOT SPEAK.
I JUST WANT TO CRY.
>> Reporter: THAI OFFICIALS
BELIEVE ANUSHA IS ONE OF MORE
THAN 20 THAI LABORERS BEING HELD
HOSTAGE IN GAZA.
>> Translator: OUR FAMILY WILL
BE BROKEN.
WE CAN'T EAT.
WE CAN'T SLEEP.
PLEASE TELL HAMAS TO RELEASE MY
SON.
I THINK MY SON IS NOT WRONG.
PLEASE TELL ISRAEL TO HELP GIVE
MY SON BACK SAFELY.
>> Reporter: THEY SAY UNTIL THEN
HIS HOME AND THEIR HEARTS WILL
