when you were stuck in a panic room and
you couldn't do anything it must have
been terrible horrible you I was in
difficult shape myself cuz I didn't

very
silent so could you hear them all around

were they doing they
were shooting outside a group of Israeli
soldier running a combat what noises
were you hearing outside what was going
on grenades and shoot you could hear

your house or close to your house I we
heard a Israeli soldier that get wound
and Shout out of pain did you did you
feel that that you perhaps should try
and go and confront these people or was
it just that would be suicide no no
that's
no I you I'm do I'm a soldier do you
have a gun no I felt
like not that was any use but uh I would
feel maybe I would feel better if I
would have yeah but I'm not a
pacifist but I I like mark on my flag
that there will be no gun in my house
mhm you know I should have no gun

[Music]
different you're now in a situation a
terrible situation where you you have to
hope your stepdaughter and her
grandmother have been taken
hostage we are not sure about anything
we hope because uh we know the dead
bodies that we know the dead people in
NEOS mhm roughly we don't know for sure
I don't think they know for
sure who died over
there uh we seal most to
the chances that they're not dead
and they're alive
