bombardments about Rafá seen from
Israel the Israeli government has been
announcing a great land incursion
At the moment the prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has not softened his
Posture we will complete the elimination of
The never also in Rafa not
There will be anything that
Stop but after months of war
Israel now faces strong
pressures of its main ally states
United Washington has urged him to
Free military operations and
I leave your plan of an invasion to great
scale in Rafá where more than one live
Million people in conditions
precarious we make Israel clear that
a large -scale military invasion in
Rafa would have an effect greatly
harmful to civilians and that in
last instance would damage the security of
Israel Israel states that an offensive
Large -scale terrestrial would have as its end
finish with
Never an invasion of this type
It would probably be similar to what
It has happened in other parts of Gaza in
urban areas like Jan Yunis and the city
from gaza north of
rafá an air campaign combined with
tanks and troops on the ground
would have catastrophic consequences for
Israel civilian population has said that
will evacuate civilians to other places
De Gaza but has not given details
concrete this type of invasion
land would perhaps cause a
distancing by states
United who has conditioned his support
military in the future to the way in which
Israel treats civilians in Gaza but
Israel has also carried out
selective operations successfully
beginning of this month the commands
They recovered the body of the At Katzir
that had been taken as reem on
October these incursions are based on
Intelligence information requires more
that in a military power
The path that Israel chosen
may depend on politics in states
United President Joe Biden
faces important pressures from the
left to stop the government
Israeli while in his country Benjamin
Netanyahu faces an opinion
public that you want mostly
defeat
