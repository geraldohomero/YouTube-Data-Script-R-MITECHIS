WE WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
WE ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE A
DIFFERENCE, TO MAKE A CHANGE
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
>> LIEUTENANT COLONEL PETER
LERNER, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
APPRECIATE IT.
>> THANK YOU, JOSE.
>>> NOW TO CAPITOL HILL, WHERE
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK
SCHUMER, HIGHEST RANKING JEWISH
ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE UNITED
STATES, GAVE A SPEECH ON THE
SENATE FLOOR CONDEMNING
ANTI-SEMITISM IN THE WAKE OF THE
HAMAS MASSACRE IN ISRAEL.
THE SPEECH CAME JUST AFTER HE
WROTE AN ESSAY FOR "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" IN WHICH HE SAYS THE
NORMALIZATION AND INTENSIFYING
OF ANTI-SEMITISM IS WHAT
AMERICAN JEWS FEAR THE MOST.
AND ONE DAY AFTER SCHUMER AND A
BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS
WATCHED VIDEO FROM THE OCTOBER
7th MASSACRE.
NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL
CORRESPONDENT ALI VITALI IS WITH
US THIS MORNING.
ALI, GREAT SEEING YOU.
WHAT MORE DID THE SENATOR HAVE
TO SAY?
>> Reporter: A SOBER SPEECH
HERE, JOSE, FROM THE HIGHEST
RANKING JEWISH OFFICIAL IN
CONGRESS AND SCHUMER SAID THAT'S
WHY HE WANTED TO BE THE ONE TO
SPEAK ABOUT THIS, SAYING THAT TO
JEWS LIKE HIM, THIS MOMENT SAY
FIVE-ALARM FIRE.
BUT CONTRASTING IT IN HIS WORDS
FOR SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE OF
GOODWILL, HE SAYS, THAT
ANTI-SEMITISM AND THE RISE OF IT
IN THIS COUNTRY IS MERELY A
PROBLEM, A MATTER OF CONCERN.
HE STEEPED THIS SPEECH IN THE
HISTORY OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE OF
THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAVE
SHOWN UP IN AN INCLUSIVE
FASHION, SCHUMER HIMSELF
POINTING TO THE WAY THAT HE HAS
WORKED AGAINST THE RISE OF
ANTIASIAN VIOLENCE, THE RISE
AGAINST MUSLIMS DURING THE TRUMP
YEARS, THAT SCHUMER AT EACH TURN
HAS WORKED FOR EQUALITY AND
PROTECTION FOR EACH OF THESE
MINORITY GROUPS AT VARIOUS
POINTS.
AND NOW HE AS A JEW IS ASKING
PEOPLE TO SHOW UP AND DO THE
SAME.
LISTEN TO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF
WHAT HE SAID HERE ON THE SENATE
FLOOR, JUST IN THE LAST HOUR,
JOSE.
>> SOME OF THE MOST EXTREME
RHETORIC AGAINST ISRAEL HAS
EMBOLDENED ANTI-SEMITES WHO ARE
ATTACKING JEWISH PEOPLE SIMPLY
BECAUSE THEY ARE JEWISH.
INDEPENDENT OF ANYTHING HAVING
TO DO WITH ISRAEL.
AND THOSE WHO ARE INCLINED TO
EXAMINE THE WORLD THROUGH THE
LENS OF OPPRESSORS VERSUS THE
OPPRESSED SHOULD TAKE NOTE THAT
THE MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF
JEWISH HISTORY ARE DEFINED BY
OPPRESSION.
>> Reporter: YOU'RE RIGHT TO
POINT OUT THAT THIS SPEECH COMES
JUST ONE DAY AFTER SENATORS WERE
ABLE TO VIEW THAT REALLY
