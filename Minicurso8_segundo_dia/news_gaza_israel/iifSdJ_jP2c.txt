in the early hours of the morning these
palestinian families are being forced to
leave their homes and belongings
the israeli military sometimes uses this
area in the north of the occupied west
bank as a training ground
this means that people who have lived
here for decades have to stay away for
as long as the army decides is necessary
israeli military jeeps move between
homes to ensure everyone has left
palestinians here say it's not their
first order to leave their home this
year and fear it won't be the last
they'll stay here until each one of us
leave their home
they'll say why aren't you out yet it's
8 a.m you have to leave
explosions like these
often break the piece here
i fear for the children they get scared
of the bombing i try to calm them down
but we're scared too
i remind them not to touch anything the
army leaves behind because it might
explode
people here say they have nowhere else
to go
so they have to stay out until they're
allowed to return to their homes after
midnight
the military drill will continue for
three days which means they'll have to
go through this again
twice this week
the israeli army told al jazeera that it
takes measures to protect civilians
during the exercises
but israeli officers previously said
that trainings are used to push
palestinians out seven families left
their homes on tuesday but many more
people used to live here 48 families
once lived in this village called zeke
now there are only 20. turkey turkmen
says he had to relocate his home five
years ago because he was tired of these
displacements
still he says his land is under threat
i've lost half of my crops because the
tanks went over them
i've had a piece of land planted with
barley and they completely ruined it
these videos are from israeli drills in
january
people here say eight structures were
demolished then
farmers we spoke to say they're not
leaving their land
some even snuck back in before the end
of the drill they wanted to take care of
the cattle
and ulam was born
while some took the risk to return home
others remain without a roof over their
heads until they're allowed to go back
home
