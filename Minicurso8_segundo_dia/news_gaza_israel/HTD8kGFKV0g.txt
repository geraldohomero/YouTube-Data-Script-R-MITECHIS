palestine's Gaza is a small strip of
land home to 2 million
Palestinians but it is essentially an
open air prison and the world's largest
concentration camp to understand how it
all started we need to go back in 1947
the UN proposed a creation of two
independent states out of the historic
Palestine with Jerusalem under the
international
regime the United States government is
willing to participate in a United
Nations program to assist the parties
involved in the establishment of a
workable political settlement in
Palestine leading up to the 1948 war
between Israel and the Arab states as a
result majority of Palestinians were
ethnically cleansed from their
historical Homeland by the Israeli
occupational
forces some of them made their way into
this tiny Enclave of
Gaza today 70% of people currently
living in Gaza belongs to those Refugee
families Israel maintains direct control
over gaza's Aira Maritime spaces and
over its Mainland border limiting
everything and everyone that passes
through
it effectively cutting off and isolating
gaza's population from Palestinian in
the occupied West Bank and isolating it
from the rest of the
world the blockade has caused a
Perpetual humanitarian crisis for the
Palestinians in
Gaza without being able to develop
Industries due to the blockade
unemployment levels in Gaza are among
the highest in the world with 62% of
gaza's Youth currently jobless 1.3
million of 2 million Garin require food
assistance since Israel's block a
prevents Garin from constructing
pipelines 78% of the pipe water in Gaza
is unfit for human
consumption Israel's continued blockade
and indiscriminate military assaults
have targeted gaza's ambulances and
hospitals Israel has launched four long
and indiscriminate military assaults on
Gaza in 2008 2012 2014 and
2021 destroying much of his health
infrastructure killing thousands of
Palestinians including scores of
children on the 17th of October
