THE CHEAPEST PLACE TO FILL UP IS
IN SASKATCHEWAN WHERE PRICES ARE
HOVERING AROUND $1.78.
BRINGING IN THE GLOBAL ENERGY
ECONOMIST, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US THIS MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING.
>> Andrea: WHAT CAN YOU TELL
US ABOUT THIS LATEST BIKE,
WHAT'S IT ATTRIBUTED TO AND WHY
NOW?
>> THE LATEST CATALYST OF COURSE
IS THE WAR IN UKRAINE.
YOU HAVE EXPORTS OF OIL.
IT'S A HUGE EXPORTER SO THE
WHOLE ENTIRE GLOBAL MARKET.
THAT IS NOT OVER -- OVER.
WE WILL GET LESS EXPERTS OUT OF
RUSSIA, MORE SUPPLY AND GOOD
DEMAND SO CHINA HAS ISSUES WITH
COVID AND IS NOT USING ANYTHING,
IF IT WASN'T FOR CHINA.
>> Andrea: HOW LONG COULD THIS
PERSIST FOR?
>> THE WAR IS NOT OVER.
WE CANNOT GROW OIL ON TREES, WE
NEED TO DRILL FOR IT.
PEOPLE HAVE NOT WANTED THEM TO
DRILL FOR MORE OIL SO IT WILL
TAKE A WHILE FOR THEM TO START
TO GROW AGAIN.
THE CYCLE, THIS YEAR, IT WILL
TAKE US AT LEAST NINE MONTHS.
THEN ANOTHER TO BEGIN FOR REAL.
SO UNLESS WE GO INTO A REALLY
DEEP RECESSION.
WE WILL SEE VERY HIGH OIL PRICES
>> Andrea: FULL OF GOOD NEWS
THIS MORNING BUT WHAT CAN THE
GOVERNMENT DO IN SITUATIONS LIKE
THIS TO PROVIDE RELIEF.
AS YOU HEARD IN THE VERY
BEGINNING OF THE SHOW THERE'S A
WOMAN SAYING THAT SHE HAS TO
CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING GROCERIES
AND BUYING GAS.
>> THE FACT IS THERE ARE MANY
COUNTRIES WHO ARE IMPACTED BY
GASOLINE SO SOME GOVERNMENTS
WILL BE PERSUADED OR ATTEMPTED
TO REDUCE LOADS, THAT'S FINE.
TEMPORARY RELIEF BUT NOTHING
STRUCTURAL.
IN EUROPE YOU HAVE HUGE
RESOURCES.
AGAIN TEMPORARY RELIEF.
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THEY
NEED TO BE PUT BACK IN A CAGE.
>> YOU ARE BASED IN NEW YORK SO
WHAT ARE GAS PRICES LOOKING LIKE
IN THE STATES?
>> WE HAVE LOWER TAXES SO WE ARE
PROBABLY LEVEL WITH ALBERTA.
WHERE THEM FROM INITIALLY, YOU
HAVE THREE DOLLARS A LITRE.
>> Andrea: ANY TIPS FOR
DRIVERS LOOKING TO SAVE SOME
MONEY?
>> YOU WILL RUE THE DAY YOU HAVE
GOT A EXTRA LARGE TRUCK.
THE FACT IS WE HAVE USED TO
LOW-COST ENERGY FOR SUCH A LONG
TIME.
TEN PLUS YEARS OF LOWER AND
LOWER EMISSION COSTS.
NOW WE WILL BE GOING THE OTHER
WAY AROUND AND THAT WILL BE VERY
PAINFUL.
>> Andrea: THANK YOU FOR
KEEPIN
