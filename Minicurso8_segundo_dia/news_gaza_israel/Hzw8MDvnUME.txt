From Pakistan to South Africa the
Mobilization of southern countries
Global for the Palestinian cause took
strength in the streets on the day
International of solidarity with the
Palestinian people some claims
that acquire more strength due to the
War on the way in the strip of
Gaza we are here against the AP in
Palestine against genocide in
Palestine we want
Yaros Indencia we have seen in everything
The world was established by
United Nations in
1977 and remember the resolution of
1948 partition by which
established a Jewish state and a state
Palestinian Arab but to date only
one is created Israel and the
Palestine recognition as a
State seems to be
stagnant is not a cause
humanitarian but of a problem
totally political is not just about
gaza but of a national cause and
attempts to exterminate
either in Gaza or Sis Jordan although
Few world leaders of the
Global northern that support the cause
Palestine their positions differ with
Many voices on the streets since
Israel began its raid in Gaza
have repeated the mobilizations of the
civil society in support of the Palestinians
So there are voices from everywhere
from the world supporting the Palestinians for
assumption what is and and we have seen it in
massive protests everywhere in the
world despite the average mainstream
despite the official discourse of the
Governments despite a a a a a all
hegemonic speech not where
Palestinians are dehumanized
Absolutely there is necessary to exist
Thus this mass support in the streets to
The Palestinians of course it is very
important not very important but it is not
enough many criticize double
West stands regarding the crisis
humanitarian in Gaza who leaves more than
15,000 Palestinians dead by attacks
Israelis more than 5000 are minor age
