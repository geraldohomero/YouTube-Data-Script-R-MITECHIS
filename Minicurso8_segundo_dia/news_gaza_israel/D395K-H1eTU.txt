i definitely do know that there were
incendiary balloons launched from
gaza into israel and i do know there
were fires caused
as a result in fields across the south
of israel
i know also that at the moment
no guards there are no reports of
injuries coming out of gaza
so we've seen limited airstrikes in
response to
incendiary balloons and at this stage
it looks like uh something that no one
was expecting frankly
but not um a major escalation at the end
of the last
at the end of the gaza hostilities that
ended 21 days ago
the idf did say that if there were
any anything came across an intended an
incendiary balloon a rocket no matter
what it was there would be a response
and perhaps that is why we have seen
this response tonight
and iris says the new prime minister in
israel tell us more about
naftali bennett's stance on that recent
flare-up you just described
between israel and gaza and nathalie
bennett is known to be a hardliner
and and a right-wing right-wing
definitely a right-wing leader
his party is called yamina to the right
but he does not rule by himself he
has a coalition of eight which includes
leftists
centrists as well as right wingers and
an arab
party for the first time ever in
israel's history
we heard from the leader of this arab
party today
describing the march in jerusalem which
i was present at
he described this as a provocation and
said it shouldn't have been allowed and
and you have to say looking at the
events of the 24 hours
that it has already um produced an
escalation
and it's interesting that that march was
agreed to
by the previous administration by the
outgoing prime minister benjamin
netanyahu
throwing this hot potato into the first
two days
of the new government's the new
government's rule
so i think it's significant politically
and i think it's also significant
significant of course from the point of
view of the escalation
