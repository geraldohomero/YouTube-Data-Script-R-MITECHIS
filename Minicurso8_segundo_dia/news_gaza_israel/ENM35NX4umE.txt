thousands of protesters again gathered
in central Tel Aviv on the Plaza known
since October 7th as hostage Square to
renew calls for the Israeli government
to take concrete action to secure the
release of friends and family being held
in captivity by Hamas in Gaza their
demands have taken on additional urgency
after the Israeli military admitted to
accidentally killing three former
hostages in the shija neighborhood of
City they were reportedly holding a
makeshift White Flag when they were shot
by battley Israeli
troops one of the Dead Samir El talaka
was buried in the Arab bwin town of
hurra in southern Israel on
Saturday and here in central Tel Aviv
the pain and anger was
palpable what's your view of how
Netanyahu is handling the
war criminal like the German
ER government in the
30s of the 19th century exactly the
same he tries to kill 2 million people
it's unbelievable I am as Israeli I'm
ashamed of our
government Ruby Chen the father of a
19-year-old hostage criticized
netanyahu's strategy of depending on
Military pressure to try to force Hamas
to negotiate the release of hostages get
the hostages back
alive
alive we don't want them backing
back the Israeli government says Hamas
is an existential threat and must be
totally destroyed but protesters argue
that releasing the hostages must take
priority some here want the war to end
others want the war to end just long
enough to bring the hostages back where
all these people here gathered in
central Tel Aviv and host Square have
been common is they want their
government to do more many that we've
spoken to here do not believe that prime
minister Netanyahu is doing enough to
bring the 130 odd hostages back home
they believe that time is running out
some say that prime minister Netanyahu
even has blood on their hands every day
that goes by brings that much more
danger to the lives of the hostages
still held in captivity by
Hamas bander trt
