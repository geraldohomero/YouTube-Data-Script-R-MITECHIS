OUTDOOR VENUES ARE ALLOWED 75%
OR 15,000 PEOPLE.
>>> 15,000 IS ALSO THE NUMBER OF
HAITIAN MIGRANTS WHO SPENT THE
PAST WEEK SHELTERING UNDER A
BRIDGE IN TEXAS, AND WHILE U.S.
OFFICIALS HAVE NOW SHUT DOWN
THAT CAMP AND SHIPPED PEOPLE OUT
OF THE COUNTRY, THOUSANDS MORE
ARE STILL HEADING NORTH AS WE
HEAR FROM CTV'S TOM WALTERS.
>> Reporter: TODAY THERE WAS
NO ONE WAITING ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN U.S. BORDER, AND TODAY
THERE WAS NO MIGRANT CAMP UNDER
A TEXAS BRIDGE.
BUT THERE WAS STILL A CRISIS.
IN PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI, THIS
FAMILY IS PLANNING TO START ALL
OVER.
>> [Speaking alternate
language]
>> Reporter: COLOMBIA, PANAMA,
PART OF THE LONG TREK THAT TOOK
THEM FROM SOUTH AMERICA TO THE
CAMP UNDER THE DEL RIO BRIDGE,
UNTIL THEY WERE PUT ON A
DEPORTATION FLIGHT BACK TO
HAITI.
[ Shouting ]
>> Reporter: IN THE U.S., SOME
RALLY AGAINST SENDING PEOPLE
INTO THE POOREST COUNTRY IN THE
HEMISPHERE, BUT IF THE AMERICAN
DEPORTATIONS ALREADY LOOK
CALLOUS, THEY'RE STARTING TO
LOOK CARELESS.
A LOCAL OFFICIAL IN
PORT-AU-PRINCE SAYS AT LEAST ONE
PERSON EXPELLED TO HAITI IS NOT
EVEN HAITIAN.
"I HAVE HIS DOCUMENTS, HIS
PASSPORT."
"HIS NATIONALITY IS ANGOLA."
THEY ARE HAITIANS, BUT HAVEN'T
BEEN THERE IN YEARS.
THEY WERE LIVING LEGALLY IN
CHILE, BUT WHEN THE PANDEMIC
CAME CHILE LOST OVER A MILLION
JOBS.
AND WITH MANY ON THE VULNERABLE,
LOW-WAGE EDGE OF THE ECONOMY,
HAITIANS WERE HARD HIT, PART OF
WHAT HAITI'S PRIME MINISTER TOLD
THE U.N. TODAY IS A CYCLE.
"MIGRATION WILL CONTINUE AS LONG
AS OUR PLANET HAS WEALTHY AREAS
AND ONES OF EXTREME POVERTY
WITHOUT ANY PROSPECT OF A BETTER
LIFE."
A BETTER LIFE, THAT'S WHY THIS
HAITIAN MIGRANT IS AMONG 16,000
IN COLOMBIA ABOUT TO BEGIN THE
JOURNEY THAT JUST ENDED FOR SO
MANY OTHERS UNDER THE DEL RIO
BRIDGE.
