ON THIS ISSUE AS IT CONTINUES TO
YOU. ALL RIGHT. A BIG DECISION
THAT WILL AFFECT THAT FORT WORTH
NEIGHBORHOOD. AMELIA JONES,
THANK YOU. ISRAEL SAYS IT WILL
STRIKE BACK AGAINST IRAN AFTER
THE COUNTRY'S WEEKEND ATTACK.
IRAN'S ATTACK WAS IN RETALIATION
TO AN ISRAELI STRIKE EARLIER
THIS MONTH. WORLD LEADERS ARE
URGING AGAINST FURTHER
ESCALATION. FOX'S JEFF PAUL
REPORTS FROM ISRAEL. REPORTER
THE HEAD OF ISRAEL'S MILITARY
PROMISING THEY WILL RETALIATE TO
IRAN'S UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK.
IRAN WILL FACE THE CONSEQUENCES
FOR ITS ACTIONS. WE WILL CHOOSE
OUR RESPONSE ACCORDINGLY. THERE
IS REPORTEDLY DEBATE AMONG THE
ISRAELI WAR CABINET SURROUNDING
WHAT THE RESPONSE WOULD LOOK
LIKE, WHILE THE ISRAELI MILITARY
SAYS 99% OF THE DRONES AND
MISSILES FIRED BY IRAN WERE
INTERCEPTED, DOING NOTHING COULD
EMBOLDEN IRAN TO STRIKE AGAIN,
SAY THE ISRAELIS. HOWEVER, MANY
OF ISRAEL'S ALLIES WHO WERE
CRITICAL IN HELPING FOIL IRAN'S
ATTACK FEAR A MAJOR STRIKE COULD
SPARK A WIDER CONFLICT IN THE
MIDDLE EAST. WE ARE WORKING
URGENTLY WITH OUR ALLIES TO
DE-ESCALATE THE SITUATION AND
PREVENT FURTHER BLOODSHED. ALL
SIDES MUST SHOW RESTRAINT. IRAN
IS STANDING FIRM, CALLING THE
STRIKE A RESPONSE TO AN ISRAELI
ATTACK ON THEIR CONSULATE IN
DAMASCUS, SYRIA, THAT KILLED TWO
TOP IRANIAN COMMANDERS. IRAN'S
FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON
SAYS THE STRIKE ON ISRAEL WAS
MEANT TO DISSUADE ISRAEL FROM
FURTHER ATTACKS. WE CARRIED OUT
THIS ACTION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF
DETERRENCE. IF ANOTHER ACTION IS
TAKEN, OUR RESPONSE WILL BE MORE
SERIOUS ON TOP OF THE SITUATION
WITH IRAN. ISRAEL STILL HAS ITS
ONGOING WAR IN GAZA, WITH THE
NEXT PHASE SEEMINGLY AIMED AT
THE SOUTHERN CITY OF RAFAH.
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING THAT THE
ISRAELI MILITARY RECENTLY CALLED
UP THOUSANDS OF RESERVISTS FOR
FUTURE OPERATIONS IN TEL AVIV.
