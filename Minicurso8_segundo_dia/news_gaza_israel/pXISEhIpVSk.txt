The fierce day is the fierce day of Israel and Havas war
The war is going on in the middle East and continuously
We are showing you her pictures and this
But all our colleagues to talk
A special guest is also associated with
General Rajan in Defense Expert Retired
Kochhar Saheb General Kochhar right now
You were watching this report of the colleague
Syria and Leban have an evolution in it
It is also and we were talking about how
Different fronts may open but Israel
All the strength is engaged in the gaz
What
will be
See Israel's
Nearly one million soldiers have entered Gaza
And if we have to their reservant army
If you include it, then there is 5 lakh strength
Israel has 2200 tanks
Near them near Makova Mark Four Ek Latest
State of the Art Tank and one in September
Bairag Tank
Another new of what has been released by it
The tank has come which is the world's best tank
So as far as the equality is concerned
Equipment is concerned about the sensors
And the airforce is concerned
Iraq Israel is very strong and remember you
Can fight more than one on the front and
Has fought even 73 also fought 67 Pu
Fought and this Lebon who is now for the force
Attack will not be a Proper Army
They have your hubla with them
Fighter is definitely good but that type
If they do not have military equipment
Even if this front will open my assessment
Israel has full potential in this
To take on the tech and one thing and you
Keep in mind
That the United States is with Israel
If any replenished to Israel today
United States wanted interceptor
This Israel has been supplied and it
Israel wanted this guided mission too
If you reach him, you can see that
Response which is supplied in total
The chain is good and the front is open
Despite this, there should be a lot of things to change more
doing
Is
Keep ABP News
Ahead
