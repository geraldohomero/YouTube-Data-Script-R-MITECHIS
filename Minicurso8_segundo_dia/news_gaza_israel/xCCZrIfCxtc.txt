when jerusalem's al-aqsa mosque was set
on fire by an arsonist in 1969
it was widely regarded as the event that
led to the creation of the oic
the organization of islamic cooperation
the need to protect islam's holiest
sites and promote cooperation between
muslim countries raised up the agenda
now the oic has 57 members but the
turkish president says its reaction to
the current crisis has been weak
if the organization of islamic
cooperation does not take a concrete and
effective position immediately it will
deny its existence as turkey we are
ready to actively support every
initiative that will be launched within
the united nations in this direction to
take responsibility for peace and to
make sacrifices
within the past few days more than 300
palestinian protesters have been injured
when israeli police fired rubber bullets
and tear gas at them at the al-aqsa
mosque in jerusalem
palestinians have also been protesting
about forced evictions from sheikh
jarrah a neighborhood in east jerusalem
which is occupied by israel the oic's
human rights commission has issued a
statement of condemnation describing
israel's actions as brutality and
terrorism
but as the situation continues to
escalate
it's also come in for more criticism
turkey has been urging the different
countries to do something collectively
as a
as an organization the oic but its
leadership which is based now in saudi
arabia
refuses to actually do or take any
strong
position towards this or at least try to
bring the international community and
pressure on the state of israel
now more than 100 palestinians have been
killed in israeli airstrikes in gaza in
the worst violence since 2014
and the clamour for international
intervention to help protect
palestinians is increasing whether the
oic can bring any pressure to bear we
will soon find out andrew hopkins trt
world
