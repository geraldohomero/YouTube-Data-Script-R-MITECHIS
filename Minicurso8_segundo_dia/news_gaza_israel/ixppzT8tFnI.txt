there's a good chance some of these
babies would either be struggling to
survive today in a Gaza hospital
or already
dead if it hadn't been for complications
in the weeks before their birth before
October
7th Israel has allowed women with
highrisk pregnancies to leave Gaza for
better
care and for most this place here is the
only option

here is nablas in the West Bank 100 kilm
from Gaza on the other side of
Israel there are 20 babies in this
neonatal Intensive Care Unit two of them
should have been discharged a month ago
but there's nobody here to take them
home Muhammad and muayed were born at 29
weeks back in August but life under
Israeli occupation meant their mother's
permit to stay by their side expired
before they were ready to be
discharged so she was forced to go back
home without them she's somewhere in
what's left of the jabalia refugee camp
and is now the one in danger not her
boys I told her be safe be safety
in that's FNA khif a social worker
watching over the twins
it's the right of a mother to be with
her children she tells
us every day their mother sends messages
are they eating are they smiling are
they growing she's begging the hospital
not to discharge them until she can
return the pain of not being able to
hold her babies is unbearable she
says then there is hanady
she came from Gaza to give birth only to
lose her child she now watches Gaza at a
distance praying she won't lose the rest
of her family as well her faith however
is
unwavering this is what God wanted she
says for this too was supposed to be the
joy of a life time she gave birth to
triplets but one died just as the war
started grief it seems is never too far
away I should have had my husband and my
mother by my side she tells
us away from their families and away
from the bombing for
now this will be
