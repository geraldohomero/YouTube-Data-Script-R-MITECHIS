[CC may contain inaccuracies] We are seeing this wave of risk aversion
gripping markets.
And this was a reaction that we saw even
despite initially those reports being
unverified.
It's clearly a case of investors selling
fast and then asking questions later.
Traders not quite prepared for this
sudden revival of Middle East tensions.
And to be clear, we already saw markets
mostly in the red.
And this was on the backdrop of those
Fed speakers coming in hawkish.
We also heard from the likes of TSMC,
for example, lowering its outlook for
the chip sector.
So the chips were really already badly
hit.
And then as the Nikkei opened 1% lower
really sagged.
Those losses accelerated as those
reports about these explosions in Iran,
Iraq, Syria started trickling in.
Now we're also seeing the MSCI
Asia-Pacific gauge of stocks in the
region hovering at the lowest level
since early February.
Now we're seeing, Brent, US crude
futures there both rising almost $3 a
barrel above the $90 handle.
And we're also watching out for the
implied volatility.
Take a look at this chart if we can, and
it will show you that that implied
volatility on crude is surging.
So this suggests that we could see even
more days like this, the swings in the
price action.
And this makes you wonder exactly what
this is going to mean for people that
are watching the inflation front.
Now, I want to take you to what we're
seeing on the safe havens as well.
The usual suspects are moving.
We're seeing it on the dollar yen, Swiss
franc, gold treasuries as well.
Worth highlighting here.
We're seeing the yen moving below the
154 level against the greenback.
The Swiss franc jumped as much as 1.2%
against the US dollar early on in the
session.
And this is worth noting because the
Swiss franc has been capped recently due
to dollar strength.
So the moves today indicate how the
Middle East tensions are perhaps a
bigger move compared to the Fed bets.
