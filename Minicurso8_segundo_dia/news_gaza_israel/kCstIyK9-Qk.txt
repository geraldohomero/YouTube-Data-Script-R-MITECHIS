MATT BRADLEY IS IN LEBANON
AGAIN TONIGHT WITH THAT PART OF
THE STORY.
>> Reporter: AFTER NEARLY TWO
DECADES OF CALM, THE LONG COLD
WAR BETWEEN HEZBOLLAH AND
ISRAEL IS HEATING UP AGAIN.
AND AGAIN THE RESIDENTS OF
NORTHERN ISRAEL ARE BEING ASKED
TO LEAVE
>> NOT GOING TO RAID, WE ARE
LEAVING.
>> STILL, THE FIGHTING HERE
REMAINS RESTRAINED.
FOR NOW, IT IS WORDS AS WELL AS
WEAPON THAT ARE FIRING ACROSS
THE BORDER.
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER TELLING
ISRAELI TROOPS IF HEZBOLLAH
ENTERS THE WAR IT WILL MAKE ITS
MISTAKE OF ITS LIFE.
CRIPPLE IT WITH A FORCE THAT
THEY CAN NOT IMAGINE.
CONCERNS GROWING AMONG ISRAEL
AND ALLIES THAT THE GROUP WILL
ESCALATE AND DRAG THE REGION
INTO WAR.
THE GROUP LOST MORE THAN TWO
DOZEN MEN HERE IN TWO WEEKS ON
LEBANON SIDE OF THE BORDER.
CIVILIANS ARE CARRYING A BIG
LOAD FOR THIS SMALL WAR.
MANY THAT LIVE AT THE BORDER
HAVE COME TO THIS SCHOOL
SEEKING REFUGE.
LIKE THERE TOBACCO FARMER WHO
BROUGHT HIS FAMILY HERE TO
ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE.
HE TELLS ME WE FOUGHT FROM THE
BOMBARDMENT, THE ARTILLERY,
HOUR HOUSE IS CLOSE TO THE
BORDER.
IT STARTED TO HIT THE HOUSES SO
I EVACUATED MY CHILDREN.
THIS CAMPUS IS HOME TO 1500
PEOPLE FROM THE BORDER REGION.
BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN
FIGHTING, MORE AND MORE ARE
COMING EVERY DAY.
>> Reporter: THEY BARELY
RECOVERED FROM THE LAST WAR IN
2006.
NOW IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN.
IF IT IS A FULL ON WAR HERE CAN
YOU HANDLE THOUSANDS MORE
PEOPLE?
>> IT IS HARD, IT IS HARD.
WE WISH IT WILL NOT REACH THIS
POINT.
THIS IS HARD.
EVEN IF IT HAPPENS WE WILL
STILL -- THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.
WE CAN NOT STOP.
PEOPLE NEED OUR HELP.
WE WILL TRY TO HELP THEM.
EVEN IF IT IS SLOW
>> HE DON'T KNOW WHEN HE AND
HIS FOUR CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE
TO RETURN TO THEIR LAND BUT HE
INSISTS THE LAND WILL STILL BE
HIS AND HE WILL TAKE UP ARMS TO
PROTECT IT.
>> OF COURSE I WILL DEFEND MY
LAND AND HONOR HE TELLS ME,
WARS ARE FORCED ON ME.
I COME DOWN AND CHECK ON MY
KIDS MAKE SURE THEY ARE OKAY
AND THEN I WILL GO.
