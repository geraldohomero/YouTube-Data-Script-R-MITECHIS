I really think we are lucky
For having left it is a miracle of God
We saw many things that we should not
to have
seen Zakira Yoa can now reflect
About his life in Gaza from security
of his new home in
Johannesburg returned to South Africa in
December after having escaped with their
children shows us the area that once
It was his home now destroyed by the
bombings when hitting the ground
Missiles vibrate and destroy everything all
our windows all our
windows inside the building
they crack and became spikes to
OUR Around that if you were in
The wrong position could really
look very bad
Wounded Jooa spent more than 25 years living
In Gaza he married a Palestinian man
formed a family and built a life
teaching English and doing work
humanitarian but that life ended
abruptly with the war between ever and
Israel started on October 7 we saw
As the buildings collapsed in front
to our eyes and while bombing
They pointed to an area 3 minutes from
our house and while the children and me
We looked from our balcony we said
This is very close to
We went to a primary school
where we stayed for a week
sleeping on the floor with a lot
all people shouted were
terrified and
furious was then when he gave himself
I realize that they had to leave
The South African embassy in search of
Help the family traveled to Rafa in the
Egypt border waited more than one
month before being able to get out of
Gaza when we pass the border and
We arrived at that stage of the trip I told myself
It's just about having faith in God because
one goes to the unknown and puts himself in
unknown situations but one receives
a superior force that is given by faith
In God that was the
key but can't help worrying
for those who were left behind including
Your ex -husband I hope he can leave
He entrusted the children to
They were sure but I don't know who
will be alive in your
family now and their five children in their
lives here but she thinks about people
of
Gaza need people who contribute
to achieve a high fire that can
Stay need peace in their lives
They are tired of war did not ask
be in a situation in which everything
It is taken away from them
