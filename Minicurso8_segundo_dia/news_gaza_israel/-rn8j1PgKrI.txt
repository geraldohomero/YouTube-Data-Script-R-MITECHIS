hello fell of mrafco you are in
direct from Jerusalem you signed a
paper in the world of the day you have
Information on the situation
humanitarian aid in Gaza and you title
that currently a hospitals are
off
yes actually eh it's the
figures that the the
Palestinian red crescent they are
excluding service because they were
bombed or because it lacks
fuel because in fact hospitals
need fuel to make it do
operate the generators and have
electricity then you said
huh they are care units
intensive but also the units for
premature babies that will be the
first aims if hospitals have
no more electricity and then as we have it
said in the report huh
Israeli bombings continue
Along the enclave hospitals are
overwhelmed but also the rescuers
To give you an example he Thursday a
13 -year -old girl came out of
rubble of a Ranunis building in
the south of the enclave after 30,35 he under
Gravas the rescuers do not have the
time in fact to go and get all the
the cors that are found
currently under the rubble and then
When he brings the injured to the hospital
There is not enough room we have
scines in hospitals, in particular the
largest hospital in Gaza Alchifa where
People are treated on the ground they
are neat by doctors then
that there are no more beds
relatives who carry the infusions a
doctor told me yesterday that he operated
now his patients in their room
Since there is no more room
available operations and some
also tell operations
without anesthetic because we lack
drugs are also lacking in
staff since according to the organization
world health over
490 caregivers were killed in
bombings since the start of the
war including 16 in the exercise of their
Function then the World Organization
of health requires a fire
immediate humanitarian
The great powers do not come to
agree we have it last night at
Security advice at the UN and we
will see earlier in Brussels thank you
a lot
