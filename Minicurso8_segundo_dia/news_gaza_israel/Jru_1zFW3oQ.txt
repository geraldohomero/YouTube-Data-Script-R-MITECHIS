MAN WHO KNEW HER SINCE HE WAS A
BABY HERE IN BERKELEY, BEFORE HE
AND HIS FAMILY MOVED TO ISRAEL.

CONCERNING, IT'S ALSO GIVING HIM
HOPE THAT HIRSCH WILL BE
RELEASED ALIVE. LIVE.
>> SHALOM HIRSCH GOLDBERG
PAULINE AARON COTLER TELLS ME
THE EMOTIONS HE FELT WHEN HE SAW
THIS VIDEO SHOWING HIS FRIEND,
24 YEAR OLD HIRSCH GOLDBERG
POLAND, WHO IS BEING HELD
HOSTAGE BY HAMAS.
>> A LOT OF TEARS, A LOT OF
CONFUSED EMOTIONS, I WOULD SAY
THE THREE MAIN EMOTIONS WERE
RELIEF, CONCERN AND URGENCY. IT
WAS THE RELIEF THAT HE THERE WAS
PROOF OF HIM BEING ALIVE. NOBODY
HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF HIM SINCE
THE VIDEO OF HIM BEING ABDUCTED.
>> TODAY MARKS 202 DAYS SINCE
HAMAS TOOK THE BERKELEY NATIVE
FROM A MUSIC FESTIVAL IN ISRAEL.
HAMAS RELEASED A HEAVILY EDITED
VIDEO OF HIRSCH ON THEIR
TELEGRAM CHANNEL. HE'S SEEN HERE
WITH PART OF HIS LEFT ARM
AMPUTATED.
>> AND THERE'S A LOT OF HOPE AND
BELIEF THAT HE WAS ALIVE. BUT TO
SEE THE PROOF THAT HE WAS WAS
THERE WAS RELIEF IN THAT AND A
LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT HIS
WELL-BEING, COTLER KNOWS
HIRSCH'S PARENTS WELL FROM
GROWING UP IN CHICAGO, AND THEY
EVEN ALL LIVED IN BERKELEY ON
THE SAME PROPERTY WHEN HIRSCH
WAS A BABY. IT'S A SCENE OUT OF
A MOVIE WHEN YOU SEE A HOSTAGE
PROOF OF LIFE VIDEO AND KNOWING
THE KID WHO IS IN THAT VIDEO,
KNOWING THE SWEET 24 YEAR OLD
KID WHO I BABYSAT FOR.
>> THIS MORNING, HIRSCH'S
PARENTS SPOKE TO GOOD MORNING
AMERICA. THEY SAY THEY'RE
RELIEVED HE IS ALIVE BUT ARE
CONCERNED FOR HIS WELL-BEING,
AND WE SEE A LEVEL OF DISTRESS
WE SEE SOME THINGS THAT CONCERN
US ABOUT HIS HEALTH, NOT ONLY
OBVIOUSLY HIS ARM THAT WE KNEW
WAS BLOWN OFF.
>> AND SO FOR US, WE'VE ALREADY
BEEN FIGHTING FOR 202 DAYS AT
THIS POINT FOR HIS RELEASE AND
THE RELEASE OF ALL THE HOSTAGES.
IT'S FUELED US EVEN MORE. WE
NEED EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THESE
NEGOTIATIONS TO LEAN IN, GET
THIS DONE, GET THESE PEOPLE HOME
.
>> NOW, COTLER LIVES HERE IN
BERKELEY AND WENT TO ISRAEL
RECENTLY TO LEND HIS SUPPORT T
