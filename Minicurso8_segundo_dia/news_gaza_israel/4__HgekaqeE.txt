this is Janine refugee
camp a place with a strong Palestinian
militant presence in the occupied West
Bank clashing with the Israeli Army who
say they are rooting out
terrorism the Palestinian Ministry of
Health say several people were
[Music]
killed the day before we went to what
locals call the graveyard of
Martyrs home to many who died trying to
end Israeli
occupation it's where we meet a Hamas
fighter it was Hamas members from Gaza
who carried out the barbaric Massacre of
October the
7th in Janine Hamas are fighting what
they see as Israeli
oppression this is our country our home
this is our
land like if if you read the history
they've been here 70 80 years it's not
they have nothing to do in this country
do you feel like there's a war here yes
it is it's it's been since two years
ago what's your ultimate
aim
Freedom kick them out of this
country he shows us the alansa
mosque the last week they destroyed the
other side with a rocket and a drone so
as you see here here you can see the
first
roet it was recently targeted by an air
strike the IDF said members of Hamas
were running a terror route underneath
it and were planning an imminent terror
attack this is where the militants were
operating in the mosque it was their
Command Center and they dug a tunnel so
that people could Escape out of the area
it is a window into a newly emboldened
resistance movement many here see the
militants as Heroes not terrorists
killing
civilians defending an oppressed and
isolated
population we meet a mother of one
fighter killed in a gun battle in March
how did you feel about him being member
of
Hamas I'm proud of my son I love Hamas
for years I have loved the group Hamas
represents us they are fighting to
liberate our country and our stolen
lands we don't believe in killing
children women or old
men but militants did exactly that on
October the 7th
carrying out a brutal
attack truth and Trust though is getting
buried in this
conflict and people here feel alienated
marginalized
deprived what's happening in Gaza has
only intensified their desire to fight
