The brutal images of terrorists
ever attacking ruthlessly
Israeli territory deserve to be
Posts in context is the only way
to try an approach to
severity of a situation that carries
decades and that makes that region to a
Of the most convulsed in the world
both Israelis and Palestinians
Historical right to inhabit the lands
of what today is the state of
Israel the Israelites say they are
descendants of the ancient Hebrew people
And what Israel is his land
promised while the Palestinians
They consider descendants of the
Philistines a town that carries in the area
more than 3000
however, who has the right
historical to those lands does not have much
importance today for that
Let's get a little closer in time
to remember the origins of the state of
Israel for that we have to ride
End of the 19th century when the current
Israel is part of the Ottoman Empire
At that time it is when Zionism is born
during the rise of nationalisms in
The 10th century popularized the concept of
a people a state in this situation
Zionism is born as movement
Politician who maintains that the Jews was
a national and non -religious group and like
Such had the right to create his own
State in its historical territory is
say in your promised land that is to say
Israel also known as Siion Si
Siion
And why then to what it was
Palestine mainly for two reasons
The Jews longed to return to Jerusalem and
Many Jewish communities carried
centuries inhabiting the area between
1882 and 1903
mass migration from Jews to Palestine
His ancient kingdom of Israel
mainly from Russia Poland and
Romania this migration was composed
for about 35,000 Jews and is known
Like the first alilla the second alilla
It began at 1904 when a wave
of anti -Semitism begins to travel
Europe and more Jews come to
Palestine
