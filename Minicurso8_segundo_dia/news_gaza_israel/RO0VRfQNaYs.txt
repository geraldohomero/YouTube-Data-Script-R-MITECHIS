This Iron is the Israeli side
Is it?
No, so Iran is
And rather surprised
350 pieces of swelling
How this is almost 99% interceptor
Is this also amazing?
So, this time the intercept
Israeli only participated in the operation
No, the British French American Jordanji Map
A fighter floats into Israel
Shooting out all drones
So, a new union air defense network
And in that sense that I made it
It can be said that such a meaningful operation
I want to show my military power
He said that there was intention, but in the meantime
Iran is now shadow without coming out
The war was a war
It's a bit more conscious. What are we now?
I'm confident
Yes, the situation has changed a bit and
It continues to be attacked by Israel
But now, we are now anymore
We can attack without being hit
He also about Isra
Redline ban is anymore
Israel is freely our revolutionary garrison
To assassinate the commander generals
I definitely see that I will not tolerate
I gave you the article reports now
It was true that it was a little unfamiliar while watching
If you are in this dispute, something attack
Success or failed
There is a tilt, but now
In this case, Israel defended well
And I attacked Iran well.
I think it's good.
If you hit it well, if you hit it as a sport,
I can tell you, but I have an interceptor
I was so good, first of all
I want to leave it actually 350g
10 ballistic missiles
The missile is virtually not good for the raid
Is it not caught?
Because the missile is catching it
Despite being so easy
Uh Israel and other countries jointly
By operating a combined air defense network
It's almost 999% intercept
How in the international community
I am surprised if I can succeed like this
There is an atmosphere
