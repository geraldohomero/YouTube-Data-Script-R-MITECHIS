ISRAEL, EGYPT AND QATAR ARE 
EXPECTED TO MEET AGAIN TODAY TO 
CONTINUE CEASE-FIRE TALKS. 
WHERE DO THINGS CURRENTLY 
STAND? 
>> Reporter: ANNE-MARIE, WHAT 
CAUGHT MY ATTENTION, TOO, FROM 
BIDEN'S REMARKS  HE SAID THERE 
WERE GAPS THAT REMAIN FOR ANY 
KIND OF CEASE-FIRE TO BE A 
REALITY. 
NOW THE ONUS IS ON OFFICIALS 
FROM THE SQUAD OF COUNTRIES TO 
HASH THIS OUT IN CAIRO, 
INCLUDING BILL BURNS, THE 
ISRAELI  SPY CHIEF, ISRAEL 
PROFESS FBI, OFFICIALS FROM 
EGYPT AND QATAR, THAT COUNTRY 
BEING THE BASE FOR HAMAS' 
POLITICAL WING. 
IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THE GAPS ARE 
BUT IT MIGHT BE ALONG THE LINES 
OF THE PROPOSAL THAT HAMAS, IN 
THE PAST FEW WEEKS, CONFIRMED 
IT IS LOOKING AT. 
THAT INCLUDES THREE STAGES, 
INCLUDING A PAUSE IN FIGHTING, 
MORE EIGHT AND THE RELEASE OF 
HOSTAGES. 
THE FIRST PHASE MIGHT SEE THE 
RELEASE OF THE ELDERLY, WOMEN 
AND CHILDREN. 
THE SECOND MIGHT SEE ISRAELI 
SOLDIERS AND THE REST OF THE 
MEN RELEAS
