 
 BROWN, WILL REVIEW FINANCING 
 AND LOOK AT THE ROLE THAT 
 CRYPTO PLAYED IN IT.
 STUART: NOW THIS.
 SOME IN THE MEDIA AND IN THE 
 GOVERNMENT ARE EQUATING THE 
 MILITARY RESPONSE BY ISRAEL TO 
 THE TERROR ACTIONS OF HAMAS.
 A SENIOR RESEARCHER AT TEL AVIV
 UNIVERSITY JOINED ME NOW.
 IT SEEMS LIKE THAT A PR PROBLEM
 FOR ISRAEL.
 >> IT'S A HARD BATTLE BECAUSE 
 WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST I DON'T
 KNOW HOW MANY BOOTS AND PEOPLE 
 THAT ARE ACTIVE ONLINE TRYING 
 TO OFFSET THE LEGITIMACY OF 
 ISRAEL AGAINST THE BARBARIC 
 GENOCIDE OF HAMAS BY CREATING A
 FALSE EQUATION BETWEEN ISRAEL'S
 LEGITIMATE RESPONSE.
 STUART: WE HAVE PEOPLE IN 
 AMERICA, STUDENTS WE 
 INTERVIEWED WHO DON'T BELIEVE 
 HAMAS COMMITTED TERROR ACTS, 
 THAT IT IS A FAKE.
 HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
 >> IT IS A TOUGH ONE.
 NOT SURPRISED YOU GAVE THIS 
 EXAMPLE.
 TODAY, YESTERDAY AN IVY LEAGUE 
 PROFESSOR SAID THAT HE WAS, 
 QUOTE, EXHILARATED AND 
 ENERGIZED BY THE MASSACRE IN 
 THE SOUTH.
 HOW -- THE STUDENTS MINDS WERE 
 POISONED, SUCH PROFESSORS.
 HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE.
 ONLINE, IT'S A WHOLE NEW BATTLE
 FOR SUCH A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE 
 ISRAEL, FIGHTING MILLIONS OF 
 PEOPLE ACTIVATING.
 STUART: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE
 PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO ISRAEL 
 TOMORROW.
 WILL IT HELP YOU?
 >> AS FAR AS I KNOW, HE WILL.
 HERE IN ISRAEL, WE APPRECIATE 
 HIS VERY WARM TALK, AND SPEECH,
 THE WAY HE TALKED LOUD AND 
 CLEAR, BUT I THINK THERE IS 
 MUCH MORE THAN THAT IN THAT 
 VISIT AND COORDINATING WITH 
 ISRAELI OFFICIALS, TO WHAT 
 EXTENT AND HOW THIS WAR, IT'S 
 NOT AN OPERATION, COME THROUGH,
 ACTUALLY WE KNOW LESS THAN WE 
 WOULD LIKE.
 STUART: IN WHAT WAY?
 YOU ARE NOT SURE WHAT THE 
 PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DO?
 IS THAT IT?
 >> THAT IS TRUE.
 IT IS NOT JUST A STATEMENT.
 NOT JUST TO SHOW HIS SUPPORT.
 WE APPRECIATE THE AMERICAN 
 SUPPORT WHICH COMES FROM ALL 
 OVER THE PLACE.
 I THINK THIS IS ONE GOAL.
 THE OTHER ONE IS SOMETHING MORE
 INTIMATE, BETWEEN OUR PRIME 
 MINISTER AND PRESIDENT BIDEN 
 AND SOMETHING THERE WOULD BE 
 INTERESTING LATER ON, WE WILL 
 KNOW DETAILS ABOUT IT.
 IT'S NOT JUST A STATEMENT WHICH
 IS IMPORTANT BY ITSELF.
 STUART: I'M OUT OF TIME BUT 
 THANKS FOR BEING WITH US THI
