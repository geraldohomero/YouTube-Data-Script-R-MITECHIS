held with a US Secretary of State Tony
blinkin as well as South Korea's foreign
minister Pac Jin uh blinkin didn't have
too much to add to the discussions that
he had at the G7 in Tokyo yesterday that
was of course when the G7 members had
called for Urgent action to address the
humanitarian crisis in Gaza and called
for uh parties
to align itself with international law
when it comes to humanitarian uh
measures uh considerations even in war
so uh we heard from pakin today saying
that he and blinkin were both very
concerned with the high number of
casualties coming out of Gaza in
Israel's uh war on Hamas he also
condemned hamas's attack that surprise
attack earlier uh in October Ober of
Israel and also reiterated the need for
