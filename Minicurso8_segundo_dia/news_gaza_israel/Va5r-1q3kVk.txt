The Palestinians were waiting for the arrival
of a truck it must be remembered that this
truck was selected even by
the Israeli army and that's a number
Important uh for this distribution
food with the rests or
or rather Israeli shots we have
today some information
important on the part of nations
United several injured uh in
the hospital inhifa so that is to say have
received from the balls which shows that
Finally the version of shooting uh
grouped from the Israeli army
and close to reality but beyond
This of this version is above all the
family question that is
today become an important issue to
Gaza French President Emmanuel
Macron asked for an investigation
independent independently of the investigation
the Israeli government if we believe
we believe what you say is it
family manager in Gaza and
What can be the consequences
international legal of such
responsibility you know them
resolutions the proposals of
resolution that were unfortunately been
sanctioned by an American vote
ask for a humanitarian truce but
the most important beyond the truce
It is above all the distribution of access to
the population of Gaza using
humanitarian and medical help therefore
If there is a failure today if there is
today this horrible consequence
therefore the death of more than 100 people
This is because the Security Council
because the Americans failed in
this to this mission with regard to the law
international it is forced by force
occupying of course to watch over the
security but also on security
food so there is a
responsibility by responsibility
shared when you have more than 200
trucks exactly are piled up that
in Rafa's border post with
the prohibition and filtering therefore of
Israeli government of course
responsibilities are clear
