the government of israel has now set the
subject of climate change as a national
aim and now in the latest development
the government proposes to plant some
450 000 trees in urban areas to help
counter rising temperatures uh
correspondent jody cohen brings you the
next report have a look
this is netanyah a city to the north of
tel aviv which was established in 1928
as one of the oldest cities in the
modern state of israel it has many trees
providing a home to nature absorbing
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
soaking up intense rainfall and
importantly providing shade to its
residents
this is
a new town right next to netanya that is
said to have four thousand dwellings
as with all new towns any trees planted
are young and will take time to grow
now the government has agreed to a plan
that by 2040 it will plant
450 000 trees along 30 000 kilometer of
roads
the trees will be planted in urban
spaces to help cool temperatures as
climate change sets in
the plan is expected to cost
716 million dollars and the aim is to
have 100 local authorities with urban
forestry plans by twenty thirty
more than ninety percent of the
country's residents live in urban
communities and the hotter the climate
gets the harder it will be to move
around outside that's why we are
preparing to plant some half a million
trees along all the roads in the cities
along which we walk
israel is one of the few places in the
world that has more trees today than it
did 100 years ago having planted 240
million trees during this time these are
largely concentrated in forests and now
the government is set to focus on trees
in urban spaces like this one
recognizing their ability to protect
people from the sun help connect people
with nature and absorb climate warming
emissions as environmental protection
