We care about what is
happening in the Middle East there are
Negotiations for several
this weeks the goal is a high
fire between Israel and never how they are
These negotiations today
Leticia yes Pablo is interesting because
Some expectation had been generated
When a kind of
draft in which it was proposed that
There could be a first phase in which
They could ever release the ever
elderly sick women of
more than 100 Israelis than today
They are still kidnapped in the Gaza Strip
and that on the other hand Israel could
release Palestinian prisoners from
This was spoken as a first
phase and then see if progress was made in a
Cessation permanently no
What is what
P a negotiation has occurred by the
which they released exactly similar
It would be similar S with the request for
background that has to do with a cessation to
fire that what they ask for or at least what
He had known is that since
Israel raised a cessation to fire
momentary what they said from Gaza is
that this cessation to the fire is so
permanent not what happened in the last
Well hours the word of
Primer Israeli benjamin netan that
What he raises is that he would not be in favor
Let's say these orders by
ever in the middle very briefly
Pablo add attention that occurred with
United States because the leader spoke
Democrat in the Senate we are talking
of Charlie Shamer who went out to say that
net was an obstacle to a possible
ceasefire that generated some tension
beyond after the
Biden administration went down a
little attention and say this was
In his own name we are not saying a
Comment on behalf of the Government or
official but good way that he slipped into
All this context we said expected
that before Ramad√°n a ce
Fire did not happen we will see if it occurs in the
next hours
