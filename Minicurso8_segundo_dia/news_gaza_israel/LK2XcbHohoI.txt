how you describe Gilles Kepppel this
which is underway in Gaza there are a few
days invited here from the big interview
Bernard Henry Levi Author of the Book
loneliness of Israel denounced he said a
Inversion of software things
that is to say that it becomes guilty
today of what is happening in Gaza he
The denounces him forcefully what do you think
And you how you describe the
situation then for the situation of
Gaza herself it is undeniable that there
Has a hatch we figures are
This provided by the administration
hassa health they may be
take with tweezers because he
there are no on -site journalists of
also makes Israeli will
But there are in any case dozens of
thousands of deaths and injured in Gaza
caused by Israeli bombings
among which children of children and
as of course combatants so
This is a fact that we cannot deny
What is happening is that a lot of
people who focus on this fact of
blow have completely forgotten what is
Passed on October 7 and therefore for me I
am not militant in favor of
The case I am
to have an analytical position it
must analyze what happened on the 7th
October why that's what I call
In the LA Radia book of October 7
how it mobilizes both
mystical and political arguments
religious of nationalist arguments and
This will happen next
Analyze the Israeli response why
She failed militarily she has
stranded for you eh the response
Israeli after 6 months yes
Finally, remember young at the time in
1973 The war of the war
from October ditre of Ramadan to the war of
Yum Kipur in 19 days operations
soldier was over there it's going
do 6 months and there is no
truly successful and even there is
more and more negative effects
like what you have just mentioned
It is not only the Palestinians
killed in mass and civilians but also the
humanitarian workers who have just been killed
This organization of World Kitchen
EXAME EUH who with a boat that
coming from Cyprus to bring
food while famine threatens to
Gaza and this boat leaves today
So we are in a situation where
Monsieur Netanahou there caught up in a
trap and it seems to me that the pressure
both demonstrations in Israel
today and American pressure
do everything to make it
decide to withdraw gold it is not going to
Do because if he withdrew he risks
to go to prison
