ALSO TODAY, WASHINGTON I
PREPARING NEW SANCTIONS AGAINS
IRAN
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH
WE ARE JOINED BOY CORRESPONDEN
MARTIN FLETCHER THANK YOU FO
JOINING US
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT AN ISRAELI
RETALIATION IS A FOREGON
CONCLUSION RIGHT NOW
ESPECIALLY WITH EUROPEAN AND
U.S. SANCTIONS
COULD THAT IMPACT OR DISSUED
ISRAEL FROM ATTACKING IRAN
>> I DON'T THINK THE SANCTIONS
BY EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATE
WILL IMPACT ISRAEL'S DECISION.
WE ARE HEARING FROM OUR SOURCE
THAT ISRAEL HAS DECIDED TO
RETALIATE IN SOME WAY.
THE DIFFERENCE IS, I
RETALIATION THE SAME A
ATTACKING?
IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT ISRAEL WILL
ATTACK IRAN DIRECTLY BUT THE
MAY RETALIATE IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
THEY MAY LAUNCH A CYBERWAR
AGAINST IRAN
THEY MAY ATTACK IRANIAN PROXIE
IN THE REGION, ESPECIALL
HEZBOLLAH IN SOUTH LEBANON
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS THA
ISRAEL CAN RESPOND WITHOUT A
ATTACK ON IRAN
THE GREAT FEAR FROM EVERYONE I
THAT THIS COULD BECOME A WIDER
WAR.
THE SANCTIONS THAT YOU MENTIONED
WILL BE CRITICAL
THEY WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT.
THEY WILL HURT IRAN.
I DON'T THINK THEY WILL BE
ENOUGH TO STOP AN ISRAEL
RESPONSE OF SOME KIND.
>> IRAN SAYS IT WILL RETALIATE
AGAIN IF AND WHEN ISRAEL
RESPONDS
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL LOO
LIKE AN ATTACK
HOWEVER, WHAT COULD A POSSIBLE
ATTACKS GOING BACK AND FORTH
RETALIATION AFTER RETALIATION,
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR THE
REGION
>> IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE.
IF ISRAEL DOES LAUNCH AN ATTAC
ON THE TERRITORY OF IRAN AND
AGAIN, IT IS AN IF, IF THEY DO
THAT, AND ANOTHER IF, IF IRA
FOLLOWS THROUGH ON THE THREAT OF
WHAT THEY CALL A MASSIVE ATTAC
ON ISRAEL, THIS IS GOING T
INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE
WAR SPREADING.
AMERICA HAS ALREADY COMMITTED TO
HELPING DEFEND ISRAEL.
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY SAID
THEY WOULD NOT HELP AN ISRAELI
ATTACK ON IRAN
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE TENSION
ARE BOILING.
BUT THE ONLY THING THAT IRAN AND
ISRAEL ACTUALLY AGREE ON IS THAT
THEY DON'T WANT A WIDER WAR.
EVERYTHING THEY ARE DOIN
SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE SLIDING
IN THAT DIRECTION.
THIS IS A SENSITIVE PERIOD I
THE MIDDLE EAST.
OBVIOUSLY, IN TERMS OF IRAN AN
ISRAEL AND ALSO THE WIDE
SECTION.
THE ARAB STATES THAT HELPE
ISRAEL DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST THE
IRANIAN ATTACK ARE NOW ALS
BEING THREATENED VERBALLY BY
IRAN
THIS COULD EASILY SPREAD TO
TERRIBLE CONFLICT IN THE AREA.
THE HOPE IS THAT IT WON'T AN
THAT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT
