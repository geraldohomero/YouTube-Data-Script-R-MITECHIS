the pride parade in jerusalem has always
been a special day and with what has
happened in the past um it's very
important for as many people to come out
and support the community and even if
you're not part of the community to show
your support and show your love
and just you know live laugh love
but past years have seen far-right
extremists attack participants of the
parade one such incident which was
widely condemned by everyone in the
political spectrum happened in the year
2015 where a man stabbed a
sixteen-year-old sria banki to death and
wounded several others at the parade
i'm really excited to be
with all these people and all this
happiness around us which is
amazing because we're so
um
we
so focus on the hate of each other and
all the things that makes us a part
and i'm so glad that there is such a
thing like a pride festival and i'm
really glad to be here
to prevent any accidents from happening
