Living the war Julian is very young

corner of his house donations but there are
a very particular issue he in a month

Enlist and we want to chat with him here
We are Julián good night with all the
We are with Luis with Carolina Te
We greet how are you good night how
Hi Julián walk how old
You are 23 years old are very young
And obviously you are totally mobilized
It seems to me that all the boys of your
age have mobilized very fast is not
there is true as a feeling of getting
available
immediately 100% yes the vast majority and my
The army ends here because
They do between 18 and 20 years
Then I already finish it but
Every Israel mobilized and everyone
is mobilizing the truth to help
The soldiers or to speak to the hundreds
of thousands who finished their service
but they entered or voluntarily or like
Army reservists you when
You are enrolling you already have training
military
Julian I was going to put me
Equally anyway so in
two months would be entering the army and
obviously that maybe those
donations that are going today together to
Young soldiers maybe in a while
They reach you
This in Israel since I arrived
two years this the truth that was always
So
It is everyone life for
another so today is today you see a
soldiers video giving food to
People that people gave to
soldiers they also wanted
It is also for them that have lost
relatives people who have run out of
Nothing without home not only for him
Army exactly there are many families
Many who lived near the border
With Gaza many who were close to the
border with Lebanon who now do not have
house or terrorism the terrorists
They destroyed the house then here they can
See there is a whole block of collections with
Children toys Frays
A lot of equipment for
soldiers themselves as so many
Reservists do not capable enter without a
Helmet or without a bulletproof vest
Then the whole society is
mobilizing to gather donations and
get food or what they need
be sun protector eh kneellets or
Let all Julian soldiers
