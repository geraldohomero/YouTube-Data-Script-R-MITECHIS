is a Middle East security analyst he
joins me now from Islamabad thanks so
much for joining us let me ask you this
from Israel's perspective these new
security measures are necessary because
gunmen entered the compound a week ago
and killed two Israeli policemen why
from your perspective is that not
justification for installing metal
detectors and upgrading security
measures at Al Aqsa
thank you for having me well we need to
understand we need to evaluate and mean
we need to comprehend the fact that it
is not physical alienation of the
Palestinians from the holy site it is
the psychological aspect that needs
reckoning installing metal detectors at
any religious site at any part of the
world is pretty much normal because it
sounds it's it's normal stuff but it's
the physical it's the psychological
aspect that one needs to account
ok so if these measures are not repealed
what do you fear could happen
well it will create a crisis within a
crisis I do not see this this this
security security measures lasting for a
long time I really don't but it will
definitely trigger a crisis within a
crisis
okay then our how do you expect them to
be repealed will the international
community perhaps have to step in here
the UN or other bodies in order to
pressure Israel to take them back
well the role of international community
is pretty much important pretty much
imperative in this case
president Erdogan's call last night to
his counterpart in Israel was a good
initiative was something international
community needs to take take along but
international community is not stepping
in is not taking is or I should say is
not doing what it needs to do in this
issue ok Sasha thank you so much for
joining us there from Islamabad
