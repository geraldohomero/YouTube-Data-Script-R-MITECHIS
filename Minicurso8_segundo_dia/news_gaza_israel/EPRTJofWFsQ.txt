Further with you Armel Charier
Hello Armel These weapons these ammunition
Americans how Israel in
Does she need she totally
need it is two allies that rely
one on the other who never have
lacking it is true that
Americans have the largest community
Israeli Jewish on the territory
diaspora of the world but behind it is
also their unwavering ally at the near
and in the Middle East and suddenly
Israelis have an armament capacity
real we know their capacity in high
technology we know their ability to
precisely to go get a lot
innovative armaments as it is a
country that has always been at war
defense industry is very sharp the
Most people are also reservists
So when you have engineers in
armament they also know perfectly
in application what it gives on the
land it gives them morevalue
considerable we just forget that Israel
is also dependent on the United States
when we talk for example about the D
iron which actually is a total
success and which allows you to stop almost
90 % of the strikes on it
Dô of rugs roughly speaking in terms of
ammunition about ten days 10 15
days later you have to recharge the Dô of
iron and this is where the
United States arrive because suddenly it
must indeed give ammunition
We had already seen it in 2020 and there the
United States had roughly put 6
month time to have airpopes
aircraft arriving and gave the
ammunition and you also have a
particularity within Israel
that we learned as and when
Years are that you have deposits
armaments which are actually made by
Americans who are stationed on the
Israeli territory whose purpose
is to serve Israel or
serve any other operation in the
zone and so we realized a
armament which was quite considerable
almost $ 4 billion
armaments that are stored in Israel
who served at the base was in 73 the
by because it was to counter the
President Nixon who did not want to help
Immediately then Israel
served regularly in the 80s
90 2000 2014 Benyamin Netaniaahou
already serves and Barak Obarama is not
Completely aware that uses
its strategic stock and especially this
that we learned is that part of this
strategic stock we took it by a
article it was in January was used to
Send ammunition in Ukraine
It was the first time in fact the
St d'Israel leave for Ukraine which
actually poses today a
problem is what will be
enough
