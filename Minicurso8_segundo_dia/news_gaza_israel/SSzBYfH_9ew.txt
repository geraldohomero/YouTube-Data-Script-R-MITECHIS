Exactly you are right, see still
Things remain very worried about here
Because you see continuously one after the other
Ultimatum is being given towards Israel
People living on the gazes should be called
It's been that you get out of there as soon as possible
Go and on the other hand you saw how Hamas
Trying to stop those who are terrorists
Are not wanting people
Get out from there because they like a shield
Use and do not want people
They come out of there if people
If you leave from here, then a lot for them
Will be difficult because the more
Civilian casualty will be as much for Hamas
It would be nice to try to show the world
Will see how Human rights Israel
How human is violating
How is the officers violating
Killing civilian and another
On the other hand they will try to provoke
People would like more people that you too
Get involved in the war with them
Have been doing it completely for many years now
Israel understands this, this is the only reason
It is constantly being said that they
Peace corridor should be given from there
For and on the other hand we saw that America
It is also every effort that this is the battle here
This is the only reason not spreading to other parts
That America's Secretary for State is
Antony Blinkan and which is currently of Arab
He is visiting the countries in Egypt
Talking yesterday and they want
These people do not get caught in any trap of Hamas and
It should not get entangled in any war and at this time
See if you talk about Israel
They are fighting, they are fighting
We have seen in the southern region where
Hamas is attacking
If you enter and fully reed Hamas
Break the bone and we have seen another
That the area of Lebanol in the northern region
From where we saw Hizbullah to them
Trys to target and their
Israel also to sour teeth
Forces are fully prepared by their missiles
The same kind to eliminate the attack
Pradeep is also being made constant strategy
And this is the reason why now somewhere here
Which Israeli saw so much wound
He is retiring in the same way Pradeep AAP
And our videos both be safe
I will turn you again
