There is a big question about what the
United States is role here.
His and in the last 24 hours, when you
look at these Houthi strikes, they've
actively targeted U.S.
commercial vessels despite previously
saying they're only targeting vessels
headed to Israel.
Is there a question here about
effectiveness and credibility when it
comes to the American military right
now?
Well, I mean, the U.S.
went in without question.
They knew that it would be very
difficult, if not impossible, for them
to quickly stop the Houthis from
attacking international shipping.
They went in because they felt they had
no other option, that they had to show
that there's a red line, that the U.S.
still is committed to preserving freedom
of international navigation.
You know, this is not the only strait in
the world that is of concern.
The Strait of Hormuz is even more
important for energy.
And, you know, there's always an issue
there as to whether Iran, which
occasionally threat threatens to do so,
could shut that down.
So these are these are this is a
signaling exercise.
But, you know, it does put the U.S.
in a very difficult position.
Really, the strategy for the U.S.
to get this done is to
dial down the war in Gaza, because the
Houthis say that they began this in
order to get,
you know, to end the war in Gaza.
The U.S.
is trying to get the Israelis to dial
that war down.
But you had Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in Washington yesterday saying
that he's not going to stop until it's
finished and rejecting outright the US
plan for trying to sort of dial down
tensions in the Middle East by saying
that he's not interested in any kind of
Palestinian state.
