Mr. President, Joe,
I want to thank you for coming here today
and for the unequivocal support
you have given Israel during these trying
times.
A support that reflects the overwhelming
will of the American people.
I've seen your support, every day,
in the depth
and breadth of cooperation that we have
had since the beginning of this war.
A level of cooperation
that is truly unprecedented
in the history of the great alliance
between our two nations.
Terrorist group Hamas has slaughtered,
as it's been pointed out,
over 1300 people
and is not hyperbole to suggest
slaughtered, slaughtered.
Including 31 Americans
as part of that
and they've taken scores
of people hostage, including children.
You said ‘Imagine what those children,
hiding
from Hamas were thinking.’
It's beyond my comprehension
to be able to imagine
what they're thinking.
Beyond my comprehension.
They've committed evils and atrocities that
make ISIS look somewhat more rational.
Americans are grieving with you,
they really are,
and Americans are worried.
Americans are worried
because we know
this is not an easy field to navigate,
what you have to do.
But the fact is that Israel,
as they respond to these attacks,
seems to me
that they have to continue to ensure
that you have
what you need to defend yourself.
And we're going to make sure
that occurs, as you know.
And we have to also bear in mind
that Hamas does not represent
all the Palestinian people
and has brought them only suffering.
I’m deeply saddened and outraged by the
explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,
and based on what I've seen, it appears,
though, it was done by the other team,
not you.
I want to say to the people of Israel,
their courage, their commitment,
their bravery is
stunning.
It's really stunning.
I'm proud to be here. Thank you.
