the departure of this patrol of
French soldiers of the Fenule in one
villages in southern Diban
border with Israel the code of
Road is the same as in France
speed limitation no more than 40 in
city we go to 20
Kmonn also this patrol is part
of the French contingent made up of 700

Lebanese the first of my missions
me is to be the eyes of my

population of southern Lebanon in
fields of education health and
development an important challenge in
the current context with dozens of
thousands of inhabitants who fled these
last weeks the south of
Lebanon The history of Lebanon is sometimes
tragic and people keep in mind
what happened as soon as there is a

Movements with more
attention and take into account the
situation around the operating area
in our trips

time played a leading role in
breast of this United force a strength
which had no longer evolved in a context
Also explosive since 2006
