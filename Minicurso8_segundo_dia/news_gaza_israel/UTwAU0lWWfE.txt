We are determined to keep moving forward with this
It will happen wherever there is violence and it is We'll find one too
In the south, it will happen on time and in conditions
The best

To the shade
It's just
The beginning and the beginning is in the north The taste of the city
Gaza is the center of gravity of the Hamas regime and there
We chose
Act north
Right now that's how we hope as clean as possible That's possible
We are not involved because that is the goal we are
We pissed ourselves off
We know how to deal mainly with terrorists and not get hurt
Uninvolved But it will be the south turn and come
Everything is in the middle of the day, as we said
Act

We've been facing a lot of stress for weeks
Huge booms to reach a cease-fire
Humanitarian pauses and all without the release of abductees
Prime Minister He also spoke with the president
Biden also talks with all the leaders and around him
All the cabinet ministers are special that this thing is gone
Possible And that's why we're on day 42 of fighting
And we didn't agree to instruct the soldiers to stop the advice
The progress of even reaching the hands
For the central minute Is when we know we can
Release abductees, not manipulative release and not
Release for public relations purposes except
Massive release's. Our abductees will only then agree
A ceasefire will be short and limited
Because after that we will continue to obtain the fighting hands that one
This is also the continuation of the campaign for liberation
