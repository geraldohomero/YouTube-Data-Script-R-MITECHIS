remove the eye that gives me pain and
put a new and beautiful one in instead
this is what four-year-old mira from the
gaza strip told her brother
she has been suffering from cancer in
her right eye known as retinoblastoma
for five months
her mother says there is no treatment
for her in gaza
but since the palestinian authority
suspended its coordination with israel
as a result of israel's annexation plan
they can't cross the israeli gaza border
to reach a hospital in jordan
there was a need to remove the eye as
the tumor spread to the brain i expect
to lose her at any time due to the
suspended coordination and the closed
border crossings
patients need an exit permit from
israeli authorities
palestinian agencies used to coordinate
their transit with israel authorities
but that has now been stopped
it has always been difficult for medical
equipment and services such chemotherapy
to be made available in gaza but since
kobe 19 the situation has worsened the
central drugstore has less than a
month's supply of cancer drugs remaining
other treatments for cancer patients
such as radiotherapy and nuclear
medicine scanning are entirely
unavailable
before the coronavirus pandemic around
2500 people would leave gaza monthly
that figure has dropped dramatically
now israel permits around only five
people a day to leave
and human rights advocates say it's
putting people's lives at risk
in the gaza strip four patients died as
a result of their inability to reach
hospitals outside the strip and there
are hundreds of cases that were unable
to reach hospitals due to changes in the
health level and the level of
coordination with the israeli
authorities to allow the passage of
patients and their access to hospitals
outside the gaza strip this is a very
dangerous situation
little mira just wants a beautiful new
eye that works but if she doesn't get
treatment soon the outcome sadly may be
very different
