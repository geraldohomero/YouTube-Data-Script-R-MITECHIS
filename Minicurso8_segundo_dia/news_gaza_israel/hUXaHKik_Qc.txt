there this to put them home B
couple
great good afternoon uh the Secretary of
General will deliver some remarks dear
representatives of the media I want to
share with you some of the key messages
I will share with the security
Council the situation in Gaza has
reached a dangerous new
low the horrific Terror attacks by Hamas
on Israel that killed more than 1,200
people and injured thousands more last
Saturday were followed by intense
bombardment of Gaza that has already
killed 1,800 people and injured
thousands
more after days of air strikes the
Israeli Defense Forces have ordered the
Palestinians in Gaza City and its
surroundings to move to the south of the
territory moving more than 1 million
people across a densely populated war
zone to a place with no food water or
accommodation when the entire territory
is under siege is extremely dangerous
and in some cases simply not
possible I've been in constant contact
with the leaders across the region focus
on ways to reduce suffering and prevent
further dangerous escalation in the West
Bank or elsewhere in the region
especially in southern
Lebanon the exchange of fire across the
blue line is very worrying it must stop
we need immediate humanitarian access
throughout Gaza so that we can get Fel
food and water to everyone in need even
Wars have rules International
humanitarian law and human rights law
must be respected and upheld civilians
must be protected and also never use the
Shields and all hostages in Gaza must be
released immediately
it is imperative that all parties and
those who influence who have influence
over them to do everything possible to
achieve this
steps finally I want to say something
about the hatred that is being stoked by
this terrible conflict across the Middle
East and around the world de humanizing
language that incites violence is never
accepted I call on all leaders to speak
out against anti-Semitism anti-muslim
bietry and eight speech of all kinds
this is a Time for the International
Community to come together around
protecting civilians and finding a
lasting solution to this unending cycle
of death and destruction thank
