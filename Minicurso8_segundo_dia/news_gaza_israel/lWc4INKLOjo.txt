FROM THE FED'S TWO DAY MEETING
WILL BE A TEST FOR STOCKS THAT
HAVE BEEN BRUISED RECENTLY BY
HOTTER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION
REPORTS. THE UN IS STEPPING UP
ITS WARNINGS ABOUT FAMINE IN
GAZA. IT COMES AS ISRAELI FORCES
GET INTO POSITION FOR A FINAL
ASSAULT ON THE SOUTHERN CITY OF
RAFAH. FOX'S TREY YINGST REPORTS
FROM TEL AVIV AS THE FIGHTING
CONTINUES IN NORTHERN AND
CENTRAL GAZA, THE RIFT BETWEEN
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU APPEARS TO BE
DEEPENING. ON TUESDAY, NETANYAHU
BRIEFED HIS CABINET ON HIS
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT,
USING THE WORD ARGUMENT FOR THE
FIRST TIME AND FOCUSING ON THE
UPCOMING OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE
REMAINING HAMAS ELEMENTS IN THE
SOUTHERN CITY OF RAFAH, WHERE
MILLIONS OF PALESTINIANS HAVE
FLED SINCE THE START OF THE WAR.
WE HAVE AN ARGUMENT WITH THE
AMERICANS ABOUT THE NEED TO
ENTER RAFAH. WE SEE NO WAY TO
ELIMINATE HAMAS MILITARILY
WITHOUT DESTROYING THESE
REMAINING BATTALIONS. DIPLOMATS
WERE HOPING A NEW CEASEFIRE DEAL
WOULD PREVENT A LARGE SCALE
OFFENSIVE IN THE CITY, AND
NEGOTIATORS ARE STILL HOLDING
TALKS IN QATAR. BUT THERE'S BEEN
LITTLE PROGRESS REPORTED SO FAR
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT BOTH
SIDES ARE STILL AT THE TABLE. WE
ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC
BECAUSE THE TALKS HAVE RESUMED
AND THAT IS A GOOD THING, AND WE
HOPE THAT THAT CONTINUES AND WE
HOPE TO BUILD UPON THAT IN THE
OUT. ON TUESDAY, THE UN ISSUED
ITS STRONGEST WARNING YET THAT
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL GAZA ARE ON
THE BRINK OF FAMINE, SAYING
ISRAEL MUST ALLOW MORE AID INTO
THE CONFLICT ZONE AND FAILING TO
DO SO COULD BE CONSIDERED A
QUOTE, WAR CRIME. THE CLOCK IS
TICKING. EVERYONE ESPECIALLY
THOSE WITH INFLUENCE, MUST
INSIST THAT ISRAEL ACTS. ISRAELI
OFFICIALS ARE TRAVELING TO THE
WHITE HOUSE TO BRIEF
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ON
PLANS TO PROTECT CIVILIANS IN
RAFAH. IN TEL AVIV, TREY YINGST,
