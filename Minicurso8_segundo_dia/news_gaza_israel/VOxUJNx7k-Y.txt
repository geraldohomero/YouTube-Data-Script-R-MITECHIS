up to 20 trucks this has been a very
uh blunt negotiation I've had and uh so
want to get as many of the trucks out as
possible there's I guess 150 or
something there not all of them will go
the first trch if there's a second TR
see how it goes the commitment is if in
fact they cross the border the UN is
going to be on the other
[Music]
side but uh the the the point being that
um if the if Hamas confiscates it or
doesn't let it get through just
confiscates it then it's going to end
because we're not going to be sending
any humanitarian Aid to Hamas if they're
going to be confiscated that's the
commitment that I've made and uh so the
bottom line is that um LC deserves some
real credit because he was very
accommodating and quite frankly uh as
everyone I have spoken to thus far since
this trip

a political disaster is
underway and yet the security Council of
the United Nations is unable to say the
only thing that truly
matters stop the
Bloodshed I repeat stop the
Bloodshed for those who think they can
avert a humanitarian catastrophe and a
regional spell over while Israel
continues continues bombing and killing
Palestinians think
again the region is united in telling
you it is not possible listen to them
the only way to prevent both is to stop
this criminal aggression against our
[Music]
people so far this Council has not even
condemned Hamas for the atrocity it
perpetrated let alone held Hamas fully
responsible posible for the situation in
Gaza but here we are discussing
humanitarian
corridors does nobody else see how
ludicrous this
is calling for calm restraint and
ceasefires is like putting a Band-Aid on
a bullet wound such steps will not
eradicate the cancer that is Hamas
humanitarian corridors will not prevent
the next atrocity the only thing that
will is the utter obliteration of this
satanic
entity what are you doing to prevent
this
