ANOTHER ISRAELI NATIONAL ARE NOW
FREE.
SANDRA.
>> Sandra: WE WILL SEARCH FOR 
UPDATES ON THEIR STORIES.
MORGAN ORTAGUS JOINING US ON THE
BREAKING NEWS, FOUNDER OF 
POLARIS NATIONAL SECURITY, THANK
YOU FOR JOINING US.
GREAT NEWS ON THE RELEASE.
HOWEVER, WE ARE LEARNING THOSE 
HOSTAGES' HEALTH IS IN POOR 
CONDITION.
>> IT'S NOT SURPRISING, SANDRA, 
AFTER THIS MANY WEEKS AND WHO 
ONLY KNOWS WHAT TYPE OF 
CONDITIONS THEY WERE IN.
WE STILL HAVE LIKE PROBABLY AT 
LEAST 218 MORE HOSTAGES STILL AS
YOU SAW ADMIRAL KIRBY SAY, AT 
LEAST TEN AMERICANS, POTENTIALLY
MORE.
SO IT'S A DANGEROUS PLACE FOR 
THESE HOSTAGES.
AND THE OLDER PEOPLE, YOU ARE 
HAPPY THEY GET OUT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M THINKING 
ABOUT, SANDRA, THE AT LEAST 20 
CHILDREN, INCLUDING BABIES, 
1-YEAR-OLD BABIES, BABIES WHO 
ARE STILL IN DIAPERS THAT WE 
KNOW ARE BEING HELD IN CAPTIVITY
RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE NO CLUE IF THOSE BABIES 
ARE GETTING THEIR DIAPER 
CHANGED, IF THEY ARE GETTING 
FORMULA, SO PLEASE DON'T ALLOW 
HAMAS DRIBBLING OUT TWO HOSTAGES
HERE, TWO THERE, OF SOME SORT OF
SIGN THAT THEY ARE CHANGING 
THEIR WAYS.
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT BRUTALLY 
RAPED AND MUTILATED BODIES OF 
MOTHERS, OF CHILDREN, AND 
BEHEADED THEM, BURNED WHOLE 
FAMILIES ALIVE.
THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT 
DESERVE ANY SORT OF PRAISE FOR 
LETTING A COUPLE PEOPLE GO HERE 
AND THERE.
>> Bill: AND SOME REPORTS TODAY 
SHOWING VIDEO OF EVIDENCE 
EARLIER TODAY, DESCRIPTION IS 
GRUESOME.
ANOTHER QUESTION OF MILITARY 
ACTION.
JOHN KIRBY SAID THE U.S. IS NOT 
DICTATING TERMS TO ISRAEL 
FOR GROUND INVASION, AND WE HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO SEE IN THE PAST 
HOUR OR SO, THE U.S. SENT A FEW 
MILITARY ADVISERS TO ISRAEL.
AS YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER NOW, 
KNOWING THE ASSETS WE HAVE IN 
THE REGION, WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO
DRAW FROM THAT, MORGAN?
>> WELL, I THINK IT IS 
SURPRISING THAT ISRAEL HAS NOT 
RESPONDED YET, ALL WE KNOW FROM 
THE REPORTING THEY HAVE BEEN 
HELD OFF FOR WHATEVER REASON 
FROM THE U.S.
I THINK WHAT WE CAN CONTROL MORE
IS NOT THE ISRAELI RESPONSE, BUT
THE AMERICAN RESPONSE.
AND IN JUST THE PAST WEEK ALONE,
THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST NINE 
ATTACKS ON U.S. BASES OR OUR 
MILITARY FACILITIES, NINE IN ONE
WEEK AND WE HAVE
