NOT BEEN SET. TATE'S
SPOKESPERSON SAYS THE RULING
WILL BE APPEALED.
PRESIDENT BIDEN JOINED 17
OTHER WORLD LEADERS DEMANDING
HAMAS RELEASE HOSTAGES IT TOOK
MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AGO IN THE
ATTACK ON ISRAEL. THIS IS A DAY
AFTER HAMAS RELEASED PROPAGANDA
VIDEO SHOWING ONE OF FIVE
ISRAELI AMERICAN HOSTAGES STILL
BELIEVED TO BE ALIVE. WE SPOKE
TO THE MOTHER ON THE STREAM
LIVE SOMETIME AGO. NOW THERE IS
A NEW INTERVIEW. DEBORA PATTA
LEARNS HOW SHE'S DOING NOW.
Reporter: LAST TIME RACHEL
GOLDBERG POLLEN HEARD FROM HER
SON HERSCH WAS OVER 200 DAYS
AGO IN A TEXT SAYING I LOVE YOU
AS HE WAS BEING TAKEN HOSTAGE
ON OCTOBER 7. THAT IS UNTIL HE
APPEARED WITH AMPUTATED HAND,
ATTACK ON HAMAS PROPAGANDA
VIDEO.
WE ARE BOTH LEFT-HANDED. NOW
HE IS NOT LEFT-HANDED ANYMORE.
IT WAS TRULY JUST AN
OVERWHELMING MOMENT.
SHE'S URGED HER SON TO STAY
STRONG.
WE ARE TELLING YOU WE LOVE
YOU. STAY STRONG. SURVIVE.
IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL
MOMENT AS A MOTHER.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE HEARS IT
OR IF HE FEELS IT OR IF HE
KNOWS IT, BUT I AM ORDERING HIM
TO SURVIVE. SO MANY PEOPLE WERE
SO EMOTIONAL BECAUSE THEY
REALLY HAVE NOT THOUGHT HE WAS
ALIVE.
Reporter: REMARKABLY THE
ANGUISH OVER HER SON'S
ABDUCTION HAS NOT PREVENTED HER
FROM SEEING THE SUFFERING OF
OTHERS.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
INNOCENT PEOPLE IN GAZA ARE
SUFFERING. AND I KNOW ONE OF
THEM REALLY WELL. HIS NAME IS
HERSH.
Reporter: HER MESSAGE TO
THOSE NEGOTIATING A DEAL.
IT REQUIRES LOVING AND
CARING ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE MORE
THAN YOU HATE THE OTHER. LET'S
BE HUMAN. LET'S FIGURE IT OUT.
LET'S END THIS.
Reporter: IT'S ENOUGH SHE
SAID. IT'S NOW TIME FOR THE
HOSTAGES TO COME HOME. DEBORA
