SOME LOCALIZED RATES HAVE
ALREADY BEEN CONDUCTED INSIDE
OF GAZA.

JOINING US NOW, NBC NEWS
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT KYLIE
COBIELLA REPORTING ON THE
GROUND IN JERUSALEM.
KELLY, IT IS AN EXTREMELY FLUID
SITUATION THERE.
WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE
EVACUATIONS?
>> JONATHAN, WE ARE STILL
HEARING THAT THOSE BORDERS ARE
CLOSED.
WE KNOW THAT THE BORDER BETWEEN
ISRAEL AND GAZA IS CLOSED.
THAT IS IN THE NORTH.
IT HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST WEEK.
THE BORDER IN THE SOUTH,
HOWEVER, IS THE ONE THAT WE

THE BORDER WITH EGYPT.
THE RAFAH CROSSING.
ACCORDING TO REPORTS, THAT
BORDER IS STILL CLOSED.
NO ONE IS GETTING THROUGH, NOT
EVEN AMERICANS.
THE PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT WAS
SUPPOSED TO APPLY UNTIL ABOUT

PEOPLE THERE, NO MOVEMENT.
AT ALL.
THERE IS ALSO, ACCORDING TO THE
UNITED NATIONS, A PACKAGE OF
HUMANITARIAN AID WAITING ON THE
EGYPTIAN SIDE TO GET INTO GAZA.
ACCORDING TO REPORTS THERE IS
NO AGREEMENT YET TO ALLOW
HUMANITARIAN AID IN.
THE U.N. IS URGENTLY CALLING
FOR FUEL TO BE BROUGHT INTO
GAZA.
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE WATER
