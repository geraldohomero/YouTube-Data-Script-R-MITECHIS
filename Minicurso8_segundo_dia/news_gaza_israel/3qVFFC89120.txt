now travel restrictions at the canada
u.s border came up
in a u.s tv interview with the prime
minister justin trudeau was asked by
chuck todd host of nbc's meet the press
what criteria is needed to reopen the
border
obviously case counts presence of
variance uh
hospitalizations obviously as
vaccinations increase
we're all hoping for good news and to
get through this
and that's not the only thorny issue
that came up in the interview to be
broadcast sunday
the prime minister responds to renewed
calls for action
on the heels of a damning u.s
intelligence report on the murder of a
saudi journalist
ctv's tom walters has that story
a day after the u.s publicly declared
that saudi crown prince mohammed bin
salman
is responsible for murder the question
is
what now the case was not much of a
mystery
in 2018 washington post journalist jamal
khashoggi
was last seen entering the saudi embassy
in istanbul
where he was dismembered with a bone saw
a cia report released yesterday
concludes that bin salman himself
ordered the killing since then the u.s
has placed visa restrictions
on 76 saudi officials but bin salman
himself is not one of them
today president biden said there is more
to come
there'll be announcements on monday what
we're going to be doing
with saudi arabia canada took action at
the time
back in 2018 you froze arms sales to
saudi arabia following
the murder of jamal khashoggi but in an
interview for nbc's meet the press
tomorrow
prime minister trudeau did not mention
that canada's freeze
actually thought out last spring or that
his government has recommitted
to a 14 billion dollar sale of light
armored vehicles
and he made no commitment to take any
action now saudi arabia remains
a strategic partner in the region for
the u.s the question is how to punish an
ally
is saudi arabia an ally of to canada
um no uh i wouldn't i wouldn't say it
there
they're a country we do business with
self-interest whether strategic or
commercial
has always made it a delicate matter to
condemn saudi arabia's medieval approach
to human rights
but release of the cia findings creates
a new complication
sandy having declared ben selman himself
responsible for murder it's hard for the
u.s to be the champions of
justice if only his underlings are held
accountable
okay tom thank you
