fedeel ghazli is 21 years old and found
his syrian bride through the internet
they were due to marry on sunday
we have both suffered for many years but
finally we are together we want to start
our future and our life together then
everything changed we almost cancelled
the wedding but now we have decided to
just postpone it until we rebuild the
house and everything is as it was before
the family home is right behind what was
a six-story office block it was blown up
in an israeli airstrike last week and
smashed into the home where fedi and
yara were to celebrate their marriage
the wedding is on hold as the rubble is
cleared
despite almost constant tension gaza
isn't short of wedding dresses
most weekends local hotels are packed
with families it is one of the few
booming businesses during hard economic
times and the periods of fighting
between palestinians and israelis when
political disagreement develops into
open conflict the dangers are all too
apparent missiles from drones landed
here before two f-16 jets bombed this
building and partly destroyed houses
nearby including fadi's family home just
over there
ferry's fiancee bought her wedding dress
with her from idlib in syria
it wasn't damaged because she was kept
in a separate room
she arrived just three days before the
airstrike
but the family count themselves lucky
that all 14 of them escaped without any
injuries
she arrived and made us happy but i wish
she hadn't witnessed this attack because
she left war and all its misery in her
country to arrive to this misery she
suffered psychological trauma and she
cries when she's sad she told my
daughter i've come from death to death
they feel fortunate as the family's
nine-year-old daughter tala's bedroom
was almost engulfed by concrete from the
explosion her toys are intact even if
the windows aren't
as soon as the house is ready they'll
set another date for the wedding
