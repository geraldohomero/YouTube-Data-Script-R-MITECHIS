We are going to the Máximo East
Attention between Palestine and Israel
intensify the attacks and there are
Information of the last hours Leticia
Yes it is Diana until they do
a few minutes at least 400 missiles
They launched from the Gaza Strip to
Israel to the south of Israel also to the
Tel Aviv region can be seen good
houses shattered the houses but this is
then gives just an air attack
From Israel to the Gaza Strip than the
objective according to the Israeli government was
The Islamic jihad that we have told
in an organization that for part of
The Palestinians is to consider a
Resistance organization for Israel
It is considered an organization
Terrorist but what happened in that attack
Good Air murdered at least 21
Palestinians among them at least 11
civilians and among the 11 a minor girl from
age we don't always tell it now
We are seeing these missile attacks
What usually happens is that Israel
has a defense system
very important antiaree that what
achieves is to intercept or achieved at least
intercept more than 150 of these missiles
They launched from the Gaza Strip
In addition to other tens that are believed to
They even fell into their own
Strip that is to say that they did not arrive in Israel
All this occurs in the frame in addition to the
Announcement of a possible negotiation together
Egypt but in parallel they continued
We always remember these attacks
This maximum attention occurs with the
Israeli Government of the Premier Benjamin
Netañau the most right government of the
Israel's history with a position
quite anti eh Palestine so good
This of course complicates more to
close remember that what is going on the year
At least 132 were killed
Palestinians and 19
Israelis good attention that as
We say with a negotiation at the door
But for now this continues
Attention between Palestine and Israel many
Thank you
