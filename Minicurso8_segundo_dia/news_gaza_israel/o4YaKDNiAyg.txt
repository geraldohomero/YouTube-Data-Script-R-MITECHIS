israel has escalated its trade war with
the palestinians
opening up a new front in a dispute by
stopping their agricultural exports
through jordan the office of israeli
defense minister naftali bennett says
the move is part of the sanctions israel
placed on palestinians after the
palestinian authority limited the import
of cows from israel
there's currently between 11 and a half
to 14 and a half million dollars worth
of dates in storage
all of this needs to be exported to 26
countries ahead of ramadan which is in
april in may if we are unable to export
our contracts with the merchants
throughout the world will face problems
because they will look for alternatives
livestock farming is big business for
israelis
israeli cattlemen raise 150 000 head of
cattle for sale to palestine every year
according to palestinian agricultural
ministry that ban has caused israeli
british 70 million dollars in lost
earnings since october
israeli breeders say they are on the
verge of bankruptcy
this boycott
hurts our business very very much
because we are not allowed to sell it
to the palestinians
and we are not able to sell it to others
so we are stuck with a very
large
living stock what neither side wants is
another wall especially one that
frustrates palestine and israeli's trade
relationship
in 2018 the total value of israeli
export palestine was around 3.65 billion
dollars the latest palestinian sanctions
will cause israel about 300 million for
palestine export to israel are worth 970
million israeli restrictions are
expected to cause palestine around 55
million
members of the palestinian private
sector say
the motivation behind israeli's latest
restriction is political
it's a political decision because it was
issued by the minister of defense not by
the minister of economy the
representative of the private sector in
joint cooperation with palestinian
leadership will confront any israeli
political decisions affecting the
palestinian economy and preventing
palestinian exports
despite years of conflict israel is
palestine's biggest trading partner
but with this latest economic dispute
palestinians may need to look for new
markets for their products
muslim fatigue crt world
is jerusalem
