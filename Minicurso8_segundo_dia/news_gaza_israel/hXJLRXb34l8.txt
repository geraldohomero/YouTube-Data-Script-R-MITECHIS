The fighting continues inside the hospital buildings inside
The buildings in the hospital have Hamas terrorists
And Islamic Jihad who decided to entrench themselves, they are entrenched
Right now Room building area
The E.R. We're at this point evacuating the patients there
There are about 220 patients in another building we produce
They have drinks With world medical equipment that all patients
And the doctors can be sure
We keep reading every last day
For terrorists in formation to prepare Anyone who buys
Whoever's alive we go in and fight
Until he was killed
- Him
I'll recognize you
Her life is here in the camp The hospital blew you off
The building loathed the sorting we exited here
A safe out
Everything's here
The safe. Attention, we're here Holy Lamb
Let's see what
We found as you can see the office of a house manager
The patients are out You can see the famous plaza
The hospital's the Qatari building across the street and you
The ER building is here

Rooms nearby The principal's office has two rooms
Designed for the stay of terrorists
They also found mortar shells in them
Bullets and a lot of money
Terror During the night the squadron forces combined with
Division
401 Battalion, Battalion, Armor Battalion, River Battalion
We did a raid and steam during the night Of a house
Discovering an enemy to destroy an enemy
And terrorist infrastructure inside the hospital compound we are
Running full steam of Hospital by me
The 401st Brigade at this point identified quite a few armed men
And suspects who tried to escape from the hospital compound
We understand Hamas uses the population
And in the hospital infrastructure as a refuge as an infrastructure
Push
