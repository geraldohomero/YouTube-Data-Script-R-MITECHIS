HOUSE COMMITTEE IS INVESTIGATING
THE CAUSE OF THE FIRES, AS WELL
AS THE RESPONSE AND
EFFECTIVENESS OF DISASTER
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS
AGREED TO SEND A TEAM OF ISRAELI
OFFICIALS TO WASHINGTON TO TALK
ABOUT THE WAR IN GAZA. THE TALKS
MILITARY'S PLANS TO ATTACK THE
HAMAS TERRORIST GROUP IN THE
SOUTHERN CITY, SOUTHERN GAZA
CITY OF RAFAH. THAT'S WHERE
ABOUT 1.5 MILLION DISPLACED
PALESTINIANS ARE SHELTERED.
FOX'S CONNOR HANSEN REPORTS.
PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYS HE'S
COMMITTED TO LONG TERME SUPPORT
FOR ISRAEL, BUT THE
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO HEAR
FROM ISRAELI MILITARY,
INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANITARIAN
OFFICIALS ON AN UPCOMING VISIT
TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO HEAR U.S.
CONCERNS ABOUT ISRAEL'S CURRENT
RAFAH PLANNING, AND TO LAY OUT
AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH THAT
WOULD TARGET KEY HAMAS ELEMENTS
IN RAFAH AND SECURE THE
EGYPT-GAZA BORDER WITHOUT A
MAJOR GROUND INVASION. NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN
SAYS MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE
HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN RAFAH AFTER
FLEEING OTHER CITIES DESTROYED
IN THE WAR. A MAJOR GROUND
MISTAKE. IT WOULD LEAD TO MORE
INNOCENT CIVILIAN DEATHS, WORSEN
THE ALREADY DIRE HUMANITARIAN
CRISIS, DEEPEN THE ANARCHY IN
GAZA, AND FURTHER ISOLATE ISRAEL
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU RECENTLY TOLD
PRESIDENT BIDEN HE IS FOCUSED ON
HIS COUNTRY'S END GOALS THE
ELIMINATION OF HAMAS, THE
RELEASE OF ALL OUR HOSTAGES, AND
THE PROMISE THAT GAZA WILL NO
LONGER POSE A THREAT TO ISRAEL
WHILE PROVIDING THE NECESSARY
HUMANITARIAN AID THAT HELPS
ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. ISRAELI
FORCES ARE CONTINUING THEIR
MISSION IN GAZA CITY, THEY SAY
THEY HAVE LAUNCHED ANOTHER RAID
ON A HOSPITAL ACCUSING HAMAS OF
REBUILDING ITS BASE THERE.
GAZA'S HEALTH MINISTRY SAID THE
ARMY ATTACKED A PART OF THE
HOSPITAL USED FOR SPECIALIZED
SURGERIES. IRGUN, A TERROR HAMAS
MANSFI. WE WILL CONTINUE TO
STRIKE WHEREVER HAMAS TRIES TO
REGAIN ITS GRIP, ISRAELI ARMY
TROOPS ARE CONTINUING TO OPERATE
IN THE HOSPITAL. COMPOUND
PRESSURE IS ON FOR MORE AID TO
BE ALLOWED INTO GAZA, AS THE UN
FOOD AGENCY WARNS THAT FAMINE IS
IMMINENT IN SOME AREAS. IN NEW
