i appreciate peace to prosperity a
gathering of diplomats executives and
billionaires in bahrain was built as an
opportunity to promote reconciliation
between palestinians and israelis
spearheaded by us president donald trump
senior advisor and son-in-law jared
kushner the conference intended to offer
a wide-ranging package of economic
incentives and investments to end the
conflict this is about creating
opportunity for the palestinian people
this is about creating opportunity for
the people throughout the middle east
if implemented correctly and competently
the economic plan i will go through now
will lead to growth in better lives
[Music]
however the palestinian authority
boycotted the event and the israeli
government was not invited
palestinian officials have widely
derided the conference as failing to
offer sustainable solutions the economic
piece which has been
presented before repeatedly and which
has failed to materialize because it
does not deal with the real components
of peace
is being presented once again recycled
once again and presented in a very as i
said this ingenuous man it's an insult
to our intelligence
kushner's plan calls for 50 billion
dollars in investment to improve
palestinian lives
without a political roadmap however many
remain doubtful the lofty goals can be
reached this is an economic plan
that if it's implemented is obviously
going to do enormous benefit to the
palestinian people
number two
obviously it isn't a substitute for the
politics and this has got to be said
very clearly because of the way people
misinterpret things
and as the proposal does not mention
israel's blockade of gaza or the israeli
occupation of the west bank
the road to peace looks likely to remain
long and arduous
philippa we're at trt world
