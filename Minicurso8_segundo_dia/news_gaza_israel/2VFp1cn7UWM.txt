unveiled to the press even before being
proposed in the war cabinet of the first
minister The scenario of the Gaza made
The big titles in
Israelle but before that the Minister of
Defense first sets its conditions
return of Israeli hostages again
retained in the Gaza Strip
dismantling military capacities
and governance of Hamas and
elimination of military threats to
Gaza Plus Question then for Galante
to see the Mass in power since 2007
In the Gaza Strip Controlling
the enclave but no question either
for Israelis to take the
control once war
completed the inhabitants of Gaza are
Palestinians therefore of the entities
Palestinian will be in charge of
management on the condition that there is
no hostile action or threat against
the state
of Israel the Minister of Defense
sweeps the declarations of
Several government ministers
Netanahou the Minister of Security
National had noted called on Monday to a
return of Jewish colonist in the band of
Gaza after the war and encouraged the
Palestinian population to emigrate
gallant does not specify, however, who
Palestinians should administer this
territory of 2.4 million inhabitants
Some analysts evoke the return
possible of the Palestinian authority of
Mmoud Abbas which currently sits in 6
Jordan occupied but his first
minister seems not to believe it I do not
Don't think Israel will leave the band
Gaza soon Israel will create her own
civil administration that will work
under the authority of his army
of occupation therefore the question
of the day after is not clear for the
moment a very hypothetical plan therefore
While the army for the time being
Israeli continues to intensify its
military operations in the
Gaza
