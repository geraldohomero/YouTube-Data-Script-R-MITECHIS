Rodrigo Pacheco how are you very good
NIGHTS Hi Esteban with pleasure of
greet you this afternoon and no doubt then
What are put on the eyes of the world
In Israel especially after these
terrible terrorist attacks that
he never did and here is important
observe two aspects although the
markets are not registering today
let's necessarily say scenarios huh very
Neither we saw a depreciation either
of the coins against the dollar that is what
what usually happens when there is a lot
uncertainty and it is important to consider
that eh finally eh you have to put
Attention on the one hand in Saudi Arabia
Remember that today you start deducting

On the part of us fed say
by training and resources from Iran to
through the hezbollah that also made
Attacks on the northern border of Israel
From Lebanon obviously huh eh
would be looking partly to avoid being
Normalize Israel's relationships with
Other Arab countries such as Arabia
Saudi that for many decades just
For the Palestinian issue it was one of the
main obstacles for this to
give and the second component there is
What to observe is this is to say if
Israel manages to find a bond
concrete in terms of this huh then
Support for Iran good because that
You can detonate a high conflict
proportions between two countries because
They have a military power
significant one being Israel
Obviously and the other of course they will go

Hydrocarbons but how good it is
All this issue of enrichment of
uranium and the possibility that they have eh
are more advanced than
supposes that the world knows and in that
Good context because it becomes a matter
Delicate and as always the Middle East
An EH area where geopolitics
converge and always get eh
Delicate say all the panorama
linked to this is what my
Dear Esteban of course very attentive
To these issues today by the way is reported
Inflation in Mexico the truth that is
a relatively positive fact huh continues
Little by little inflation is
located in just September in 4.45
no matter how in line with what they estimated
the analysts and the underlying the one who
Discount volatility in 5.76 by.is

big hug
