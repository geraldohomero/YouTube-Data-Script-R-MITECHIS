okay that's all yep and then secondly
the Palestinians say that they are going
to introduce or get someone to introduce
on their behalf a resolution condemning
Israeli settlement activity at the UN or
they're going to introduce a resolution
at the UN that would condemn Israeli
settlement at could write what's your
position on that is this something that
the United States would support or
detail well so
we understand there is an early draft
that the Palestinians have shared
informally and York and I'm not going to
comment on what is really an informal
draft resolution nothing has been
formally introduced or circulated the
Security Council and nothing has been
introduced by a security council member
excuse me
yeah
so I mean I guess I would say that this
is not an uncommon practice
at the UN but we just don't have any
comment on like I said this is very
early early stage an uncommon practice
for the positions to work or traps to
circulate like this at a very early
stage but not there's been no formal
draft offered okay so you don't have a
position on it on address other than
beyond our general position on
settlements okay
urine today was talking about was
pushing other countries to raise
political pressure on Israel and they
say that with more than 540 demolitions
and confiscations in the occupied West
Bank so far this year and the Israeli
military has already matched or exceeded
total of 2015 and there's one do you
do you feel that that is a worrying
trend and
that well I think we've spoken
from here and elsewhere
about our concerns about ongoing
settlement activity
and that we believe they're illegitimate
and counter productive to the cause of a
peace in the Middle East and that hasn't
changed
and that doesn't change what
with the Palestinians are not trying to
again so I just want to set that apart
so that's a very draft
resolution it's not ready as we say that
ready for primetime yet so we you know
we've seen it but we're not going to
comment on at this current phone
