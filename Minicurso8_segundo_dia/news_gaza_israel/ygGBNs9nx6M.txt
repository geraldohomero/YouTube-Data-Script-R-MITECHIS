Stefan Enaro Geopolitical Consultant
collaborator of this space every week
I greet you from Acapulco in the framework of
The bank convention here from the world
Imperial hey Stefhanie what is happening
With Iraq with Iran with Israel you were
Reporting exploses that arose
Explosions
Not so Pedro is the situation is
Delicate in the middle either they are reported
Simultaneous explosions in Iraq in Iran
and in Syria at the same time allegedly
from Israel and this is delicate because in
the city of Iran that is Isaf where
They report the explosions where
has the greatest nuclear weapons of the
Persian nation and it should be noted that
just yesterday the Minister of
Iran's exterior said that if Israel
They were attacked that now their answer
It would be of maximum level are closing the
Airports in Iran are closing the
airspace diverting airplanes you have to
be pending the situation in
Middle East is delicate and already the dollar
He is appreciating his
hey value and what can you tell us
Stefhanie regarding the wars of the
water because precisely in the Middle East is
where more problems will be had for
water a lot of population will not have
water to drink will be more conflicts
But the most worrying is in the
Mexican territory for 2050 20 of the
32 entities will not have water
enough and this will make 60
by the territory the
same torque as the rest and obviously this
We will get away from peace more and more
how much
We yearn and also if this is added
that this is going to be aggravated with him
Theme of climate change because
Then the water will become
something extremely quoted and
Precious that is we saw yesterday images
from Lake Pazcuaro El Michoac√°n that has
lost 42 by its surface and
This is by illegal extractions already
They are stealing the water and this speaks to us
that water is going to be the new
grail and I think the states that are going to
have a greater problem with water
They will be Baja California Sur
Aguascalientes the State of Mexico
Sonora Chihuahua Sinaloa and Zacatecas and
Guanajuato then are the states that
more conflicts will have from here to
2050
Well, well if you allow us
We will continue talking about this topic that
It is very important Stefan during the
Next weeks thanks and greetings
Pedro slopes
