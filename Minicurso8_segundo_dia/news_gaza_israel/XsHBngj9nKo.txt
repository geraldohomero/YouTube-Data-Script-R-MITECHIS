as  I mentioned a second  
group of  Israeli hostages. 
released  by  Hamas.  
Saturday  after a fairly  
concerning  delay as  the 
Ford a ceasefire  does. 
continue  that  second  group 
made up of  eight.  
Israeli children  and five  
Israeli women what  you're  
looking at  right now 
are photos of the Israeli 
hostages  released  over  
that  two day period  and 
these are coming  in  from  
Israel. on  their Twitter or  
X page. They  posted  a photo 
of  each  of  those hostages. 
that  has been  released  so  
far.  one of  those is  Ohad  
munder  who spent his nine  
birthday  as  a hostage in  
Gaza  He  was among 
four young  children  
freed from  captivity Friday  
as  he returned with  his 
mother  and grandmother to  
Israel  on  the first day of  
the planned for day truce and

showed Ohad running down  a 
hospital  corridor. straight  
into  his father's  open  
arms  as  the pair  were. 
reunited  after almost  50  
days  without any contact his 
father  then  lifting him up  
now the hospital  and family  
have  released  this  footage 
and I do  want  to  show  
it to you.  It's  about 20  
seconds in  length. again 
that  video was released  by  
a Schneider Medical Center. 
They  provided  it  with  the 
family's approval Of  course. 
and we  do  expect  that  
third group of  hostages  
should  be  released  at some 
point today.  So  we are  
following the latest  and 
we'll bring it  to you. live  
raw and unfiltered  as  it  
does  happen. We do have  
this  live  look  right here  
over  at the  rafah Crossing  
that is where we  are seeing  
those Israeli hostages  
taken.  over  back  to  
Israel  as  they  are.  
exchanged quote unquote for 
those Palestinian prisoners 
again a live look here  as
