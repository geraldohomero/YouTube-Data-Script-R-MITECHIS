PICTURES THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE
TO BRING YOU.
THEY WERE FREEZING FOR A BIT,
BUT THERE THEY ARE AGAIN.
LIVE PICTURES FROM THE WEST BANK
WHERE IT IS 8:36, AND YOU CAN
SEE DARKNESS HAS FALLEN.
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S CROWDS OF
PEOPLE.
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE FLAGS ARE
FLYING.
THIS IS WHERE THE HUGE CROWD IS
WAITING FOR PALESTINIANS WHO
HAVE BEEN HELD BY ISRAEL ARE
BEING BROUGHT AND BEING RELEASED
AS PART OF THE DEAL THAT ALSO
SAW THE RELEASE OF 13 PRISONERS
OF HAMAS.
I ALSO WANT, AS WE'RE WATCHING
THESE PICTURES, TO TURN TO AN
UPDATE FROM OUR NBC NEWS
CORRESPONDENT DAVID NORIEGA WHO
IS IN RAMALLAH THERE WHERE THOSE
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS WERE
REPORT
REPORTEDLY BUSSED IN JUST
MOMENTS AGO.
HERE HE IS.
>> Reporter: WHAT WE'RE SEEING
NOW IS THE MOMENT IN WHICH 39
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS ARE BEING
RELEASED FROM AN ISRAELI
MILITARY PRISON THAT'S JUST DOWN
THE ROAD THAT WAY INTO THE
STREETS OF RAMALLAH AND THE
OCCUPIED WEST BANK.
THESE ARE RED CROSS BUSES
CARRYING THE PRISONERS THERE.
IS A LARGE CROWD HERE OF
PALESTINIAN RESIDENTS OF THE
WEST BANK.
MANY OF THEM ARE WAVING
PALESTINIAN FLAGS.
MANY ARE WAVING GREEN HAMAS
FLAGS AND CHANTING INTO PART OF
HAMAS.
THE PRISONERS BEING RELEASED
TODAY ARE ALL WOMEN AND TEENAGE
MALES 18 AND UNDER.
SOME WERE CONVICTED OF SERIOUS
CRIMES, INCLUDING ATTEMPTED
MURDER.
MANY WERE NEITHER CONVICTED NOR
CHARGED, BUT DETAINED UNDER
SUSPICION OF VIOLENT ACTIVITY.
THE PALESTINIANS THAT I'VE
SPOKEN TO HERE TONIGHT SAY THESE
ARRESTS ARE UNJUSTIFIED, THAT
THEY HAPPENED -- I SPOKE TO THE
FATHER OF ONE OF THESE
17-YEAR-OLD BOYS WHO SAID HE WAS
ARRESTED WITHOUT ENGAGING IN
VIOLENT ACTIVITY OR POLITICAL
ACTIVITY.
IT'S BEEN A TENSE AND CHAOTIC
EVENING AS THE CROWD HAS
ATTENTION
ATTEMPTED TO APPROACH THE
PRISON.
THEY HAVE BEEN RAPPELLED BY TEAR
