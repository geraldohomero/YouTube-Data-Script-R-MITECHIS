and quite cautious atmosphere then there
has hope of course on the side of
families of the hostages that you know
manifest
regularly every night all
Saturday evenings in Tel Aviv they hope
that this time negotiations
will succeed and that they will be able to review
their loved ones but there are also it is necessary
Well say it about the reluctance expressed
by a whole other part of the
population and until
Israeli government because
people here who are opposed to an agreement and
that it and a truce
would benefit Hamas Benjamin
Netanahou the Prime Minister must therefore
arbitrate between these two trends this
that he has expressed these last days these
last hours is that he was out of
question for Israel to release
prisoners who would have been involved
in the attacks of October 7 and
also high frames of Hamas so
Negotiation relates both to the
number of released prisoners but
also on their quality on the level
involvement they had in
attacks against Israelis
Americans you said on their side
Well put pressure on Israel for
Go to this truce as to Hamas
Of course there remains a very point
important to clarify on the side of Israel
is that Hamas so far
officially requested a total judgment
fights what the
Israeli authorities who would be ready to
a truce but especially not a stop
definitive fighting and especially not
as Hamas has left the Hamas left
Gaza St√©phane band this plan He
provides for hostage release is it
that we know exactly 4 months later
How much are still alive and detained
speak
Hamas then it's the vague the army
Israeli gave figures yesterday
So there are 136 Israelis who
officially are still held by
Hamas in Gata on these 136 Israelis
Well 32 according to the Israeli army
would have died the Israeli army has
informed families and taken
Several S 'there would still be 20
other additional Israelis who do not
would be more alive so there would be
Between 4 between 80 and 100 Israelis who
would still be detained in the band of
Gaza
