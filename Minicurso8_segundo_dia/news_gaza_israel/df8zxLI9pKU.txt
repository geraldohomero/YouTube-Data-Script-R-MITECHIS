HOSTAGES YESTERDAY AND ISRAEL
LAUNCHES MAJOR GROUND A FENCIVE,
WEIGHING THAT DECISION STILL.
LEST GO TO TREY YINGST LIVE IN
ISRAEL ON THE FRONT LINES.
REPORTER: DANA, GOOD MORNING.
WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS AND
LEARNING FROM THE ISRAELI
MILITARY AT THIS HOUR THAT
THEY'VE TAKEN OUT THREE DEPUTY
COMMANDERS OF HAMAS INSIDE THE
GAZA STRIP USING PRECISION
STRIKES.
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT'S
YET ANOTHER INDICATION THE
ISRAELIS ARE GOING FOR THE TOP
OF HAMAS LEADERSHIP AHEAD OF
WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A GROUND
OPERATION INTO THE STRIP.
YOU MENTIONED OVERNIGHT 400 AIR
STRIKES TARGETING BOTH HAMAS AND
ISLAMIC JIHAD CELLS INSIDE GAZA
AND INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE IS
SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE STRIP
AND ISRAELIS ARE TELLING PEOPLE
TO CONTINUE MOVING SOUTH AND
GETTING OUT OF THE WAY IN THE
NORTH.
CALLING FOR PEOPLE TO GIVE ANY
INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE ABOUT
THE HOSTAGES TO THE ZITI
REALLIES AND OFFERING A MONETARY
REWARD AND SAFE PASSAGE IF THAT
INFORMATION IS CON IF I WERED.
WE HAVE VIDEO OF ONE OF THE
HOSTAGES RELEASED YESTERDAY AND
ISRAELI CITIZEN AND 85-YEAR-OLD
WOMAN FROM THE TOWN WHO SPOKE
TODAY IN TEL AVIV FROM A
HOSPITAL.
>> THEY MOVED USTION TO OPENING
OF THE TUNNEL AND ON THE
MOTORCYCLE AND LEGS ON ONE SIDE
AND BODY ON THE OTHER SIDE.
THEY HIT ME AND DIDN'T BREAK MY
RIBS BUT HURT ME A LOT IN THE
AREA MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO
BREATHE.
>> THE OTHER HOSTAGES AND 220 OF
THEM BEING HELD AND ARE BEING
STREETED BY HAMAS.
OFFICIALS IN DOHA REACTING TO
THE RELEASE AND THIS.
>> WE RELEASE THEM AND THEY
ANNOUNCED THAT THAT NOW THEY'RE
GUTIERREZED IN DIFFERENT
LOCATION -- DISTRIBUTED IN
DIFFERENT AREAS AND ISRAEL
KILLED 22 OF THEM BECAUSE OF
DESTRUCTION IT'S CAUSED AND
THEREFORE IF SHE WAS KEEN ON
THEIR SAFETY, IF THE EUROPEANS
AND AMERICANS ARE KEEN ON THEIR
SIDE, LET THEM FORCE ISRAEL TO
STOP IT IS AGGRESSION.
TO STOP THIS GENOCIDE AND BRUTAL
WAR CRIMES WHICH ARE COMMITTED
EVERY DAY.
TAY HAVE PROVIDED MEDICINE AND
FOOD.
A LITTLE BIT TO THESE HOSTAGES
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE
HUMANITARIANS BUT BECAUSE THEY
WANT THESE PEOPLE TO SURVIVE.
IT'S THE ONLY BARGAINING CHIP
THAT HAMAS HAS LEFT AGAINST
ISRAEL.
