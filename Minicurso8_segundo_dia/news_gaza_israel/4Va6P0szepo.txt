maya buraveda once wanted to become a
hospital secretary
now she spends most of her time in bed a
bandage covering the eye she lost while
protesting against the gaza blockade
i regularly took part in the protest and
was injured several times
the last time was on december 6th i was
protesting peacefully at the time
without posing any danger to any soldier
first the soldier fired tear gas
directly at me then he was pointing at
my face then after the place became calm
in a moment of treachery he fired a
rubber bullet directly at me he meant to
hit the eye
abu veda is just one of thousands
attacked by israeli forces during
demonstrations the protest gained
momentum after u.s president donald
trump recognized the city of jerusalem
as israel's permanent capital
palestinians regard east jerusalem as
the capital of a future state and a 1980
u.n resolution has already declared
israel's occupation of the city as null
and void
despite international condemnation of
what the united nations has called
excessive use of force against civilians
in gaza by israeli forces things have
remained unchanged
except for those left with permanent
scars
the injury has affected my life i lost
my job i used to work daily it has
affected my household financially i got
separated from my wife because of the
injury and this is what happened to me
it's left many of those who are part of
the protest disillusioned and bitter
the result frankly is not worth the cost
the result was also not guaranteed
that goal of lifting the seeds and
alleviating tough conditions so far we
can't say these protests have achieved
their goals even at this hefty cost
but a heavy price to pay without
reaching a goal until this point that is
a bad thing
it's also left those permanently injured
as a burden on others and their own life
in tatters
