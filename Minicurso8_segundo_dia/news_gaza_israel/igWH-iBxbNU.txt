more than 40 kilm from the Gaza Strip
Rockets can still fire at Israeli cities
or bases most are shot down by the
Israelis famed defense system but some
landed here in a village in the desert
near the Israeli city of
beeva the village is unrecognized by the
government and sparsely populated by BN
families they are neither Israeli nor
Palestinian but they are in the line of
fire children died when this man's yard
was hit including two of his
sons it happened on a Saturday we were
safe until 6:00 in the morning when the
first Missile hit the whole family woke
up from the noise and we gathered so
everyone was saying thanks for being
alive after 40 minutes as the adults
discussed the attack another rocket
landed killing two 16-year-old boys and
two
11-year-olds they were two of ibrahim's
sons and two of his
nephews and after two months of war in
Gaza thousands of children are dead
UNICEF says Gaza is once again the
world's most dangerous place to be a
child and as battles resume in force
after a week-long ceasefire hospitals in
Gaza are overwhelmed without the
resources or even safe places to treat
the injured during the 7-Day break more
than 100 hostages held in Gaza were
released including 30 children according
to UNICEF while Israel released about
240 detainees nearly 45% under 18 years
old according to the New York
Times but the ceasefire ended with
renewed attacks in Gaza and a new round
of skyrocketing deaths UNICEF says they
expect hundreds of children to die every
every day neither side has shown a
Reason for Hope for another ceasefire
soon in Israeli cities and towns in the
occupied West Bank and here in villages
between the two residents say despite
the conflict or sometimes because of the
conflict they are determined not to
leave we thank God and we will not run
away we are part of this place and we
will remain here until God's
will
mashallah he says this land lies between
an Israeli city and a military Airfield
but it is far enough from both that he
cannot guess where the rockets that
killed his sons were
aimed his children he emphasizes were no
more involved in the making of this war
than the children in Gaza Heather
