forty-year-old palestinian sadat grape
lives in the village of beit itza in the
occupy west bank with his family
he has four children and works for
palestinian authority
his father built the house in 1967.
the family also claims ownership of the
land from as far back as the ottoman era
since 1967 settlement blocks were built
around the house which is considered
illegal by the international community
in 2006 israeli authorities built a six
meter high security fence around the
grape family to isolate them from the
settlers
he says his children are paying the
price
the children are psychologically tired
they feel like they are in a prison they
see settler kids playing freely while
they are confined only when they visit
relatives away from the house they feel
free
when the fence was first built the
entrance was completely blocked but then
salad won a legal battle in an israeli
court and was able to open it
but security cameras installed by
israeli authorities watched them all the
time
are you angry and bother being watched
our every behavior is calculated
sadat has hung blue triplings on the
fence for a bit of privacy from the
settlers
israel used metal security fences to
isolate the garib family from nearby
jewish settlers in beit it's a village
but sarat says these fences won't stop
other palestinians in the village from
showing solidarity with the family
during what he calls israeli assaults
we have stood with the gareeb family all
the time beginning in 1982 till they
were surrounded by the fence the
residents of the village have been
helping the family by taking out the
fence about 50 to 60 percent of the
youth in the village have been arrested
by israeli forces because they've shown
solidarity with the garib family
sadat says israeli settlers had offered
to buy the home from him and his father
but the family turned them down many
times
they could have lived in a better place
if they sold the house but sadat says
they will never leave the place and
patiently wait for the occupation to end
the world occupied west bank
