the Prime Minister Netanyahu has said
that Israel will decide whether and how
to respond to
Iran's missile and drone strikes on
Israelis he's also brushed off calls for
restrain from close allies including the

as West Asia Teeters on the edge of an
allout War let's rewind to the events
early this month that set the stage for
this perilous
situation on April 1st Iranian Embassy
in Damascus was attacked resulting in
the death of a top Iranian General
Israel was immediately blamed for the
assault in the past Israeli forces have
carried out attacks against high value
Iranian targets however this time Teran
decided to respond directly
shattering the delicate balance that had
previously defined the relationship
between the two West Asian
fors Israel has vowed to respond to
Iran's unprecedented attack though not
revealing how it will do
so Iran's president wants that even the
tiniest invasion of its territory would
bring a massive and harsh response
pushing the region to the
brink I don't want to agerate but we are
on the hedge of a war a origional war in
the Middle East which will be sending
shock waves to the rest of the world and
in particular to

restraint but the Israeli Prime Minister

in defending is is and I say this for
both the verbal support and support in
actions they also have all kinds of
proposals and advice I appreciate it but
I want to be clear we will make our
decisions on our own and the state of
Israel will do what it needs to defend
itself now it all depends how the
Israeli leadership makes its strategic
calculations this time what's worrying
Washington is that its long-term Ally
Israel chose to to keep it in dark about
its role in Damascus strike this lack of
transparency has only heightened the
tensions as Washington finds itself
drawn into a conflict it may have sought
