N
FOR ISRAEL PUBLICLY SUGGESTED
THAT ISRAEL HAS A PLAN TO
EVACUATE MANY OF THE MORE THAN
ONE MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE FLED
TO SOUTHERN DE AZA.
THIS COMES AS THE U.S. CONTINUES
TO CALL ON ISRAEL TO ALLOW MORE
HUMANITARIAN AID INTO THE AREA.
WHAT PLANT DOES ISRAEL HAVE WHEN
IT COMES TO ATTACKING RAFAH AND
THEN MOVING CIVILIANS OUT OF
HARM'S WAY?
>> U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THERE IS
NO PLAN.
THE TOP MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID
TODAY THAT THEY HAVE A PLAN TO
EVACUATE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF
GAZANS WHO HAVE FLED.
THEY WOULD BE EVACUATED TO
HUMANITARIAN ISLANDS IN GAZAN.
HE GAVE NO MORE DETAIL THAN
THAT.
THE U.S. OFFICIALS I'VE SPOKEN
TO ARE VERY SKEPTICAL THAT THIS
IS ACTUALLY A PLAN.
>> THEY ARE CAST TO BE IF THERE
IS GOING TO BE MILITARY
OPERATIONS IN RAFAH A CLEAR AND
IMPLEMENTABLE PLAN TO GET
CIVILIANS OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND
PROVIDE FOR THEM.
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT PLAN.
IS IT POSSIBLE?
IT IS POSSIBLE.
BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO
SEE IT.
AND TO MAKE SURE IT IS SOMETHING
THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED.
>> U.S. OFFICIALS I'VE SPOKEN TO
ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THERE WOULD
EVER BE A PLAN THAT ISRAEL HAS
TO EVACUATE ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
THEY DO BELIEVE ISRAEL IS
SERIOUS ABOUT GOING INTO RAFAH
BECAUSE THE FINAL FOUR
BATTALIONS OF HAMAS ARE THERE.
ISRAEL SAYS THEY MUST BE
DEFEATED.
WHICH LED TO WARNINGS ABOUT WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN IF ISRAEL GOES INTO
RAFAH AND WHAT MULTIPLE
OFFICIALS SAY ARE CONSIDERATIONS
WHAT HAPPENS.
THERE COULD BE VOTES IN THE
SECURITY COUNCIL TO CONDITIONING
THE USE AND SALE OF WEAPONS TO
ISRAEL.
BUT WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM THAT.
>> THE U.S. IS STILL TRYING TO
GET A HOSTAGE DEAL.
WHAT IS THE LATEST?
THERE HAS BEEN AN EFFORT IN THE
REGION TRYING TO GET A PASSIVE
FORWARD.
WHAT U.S. OFFICIALS FEAR IS THAT
HAMAS IS BIDING TIME, HOPING
DURING RAMADAN THAT ISRAEL WILL
MAKE A MOVE THAT WOULD INFLAME
OPINION AND ALLEVIATE SOME OF
THE PRESSURE THAT IS BEING PUT
ON HAMAS, ESPECIALLY BY QATAR
RIGHT NOW.
PART OF THAT IS FOR LOSS ONCE
THE WORLD -- HAMAS ONCE THE
WORLD TO FOCUS ON THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.
>> ONE THAT IS VERY REAL.
>> ESPECIALLY ABOUT FOOD.
THEY SAY ALL OF THE 2.2 MILLION
PEOPLE IN GAZAN ARE IN FOOD
PRICES.
ONE QUARTER OF GAZANS IS ONE
