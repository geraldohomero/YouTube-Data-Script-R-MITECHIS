LIKED -- THAT SHE COULD JUST
HEAR SHOOTING, LIKE ALL OVER THE
SCHOOL.
>> Akshay: CTV'S RICHARD MADAN
IS FOLLOWING THIS STORY FOR US.
RICHARD, WHAT A TRAGEDY THIS
MORNING IN NASHVILLE.
>> Richard: YEAH.
IT IS.
AND AN ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR ONE,
UNFORTUNATELY, IN THIS COUNTRY,
WITH THE GUN CRISIS REALLY OUT
OF CONTROL.
I BELIEVE THIS IS THE 129th
MASS SHOOTING THIS YEAR ALONE.
A MASS SHOOTING DEFINED AS FIVE
OR MORE PEOPLE.
IN THIS CASE, THERE'S AT LEAST
SEVEN, POSSIBLY EIGHT, AS THE
INVESTIGATORS LOOK AT THE SCENE
AND SCOUR TO SEE WHAT POSSIBLY
CAUSED THIS HORRENDOUS MOOSE
SHOOTING IN NASHVILLE AT THAT
PRIVATE SCHOOL, AND THIS IS A
VERY SMALL CHRISTIAN SCHOOL.
THE WEBSITE SAYS ROUGHLY 200
STUDENTS ATTEND OF THE
TEACHER-STUDENT RATIO IS 8-1, SO
THIS IS A VERY TIGHT-KNIT
SCHOOL, AND I CAN JUST IMAGINE
THE HEARTBREAK AND ANXIETY MANY
PARENTS ARE FEELING IN THAT AREA
AND INDEED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS
AMERICA SUFFERS ANOTHER
UNBELIEVABLY SAD MASS SHOOTING
THAT'S ENTIRELY PREVENTIBLE.
WE'RE WAITING ON WORD BY
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, WHO WILL BE
ADDRESSING THE NATION SHORTLY AT
AN EVENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, SO
WE'RE GONNA STAND BY TO HEAR
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING EARLIER
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
BRIEFED AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS
ARE ON-SCENE TO ASSIST THE
INVESTIGATION.
>> Akshay: THIS IS SO SAD.
THREE CHILDREN, THREE ADULTS WHO
HAVE BEEN KILLED, AND OF COURSE,
THE SUSPECT AS WELL.
WHAT TO WE KNOW ABOUT THE
SUSPECT IN THIS CASE, RICHARD?
>> Richard: AT THIS POINT, WE
DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE THAN WHAT
THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE SAID:
IT APPEARS TO BE A 28-YEAR-OLD
FEMALE.
THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS MOTIVE.
WHAT DROVE THIS SHOOTER TO STORM
INTO THIS PRIVATE ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL AND OPEN FIRE?
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY QUESTIONS
INVESTIGATORS ARE POURING
THROUGH AS THEY COMB THE SCENE,
ALONG WITH AID FROM FEDERAL
AGENTS.
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY
PREVENTIBLE TRAGEDY, AND ONE
THAT WE'VE SEEN REPEAT LID HERE
IN THE U.S.
>> Akshay: ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
OF COURSE, KEEPING A CLOSE EYE
ON WHAT THE P
