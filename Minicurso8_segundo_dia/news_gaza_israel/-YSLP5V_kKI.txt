excited

with their parents or with a confirmed

to
the decision to vaccinate a dolce age
group was made last week following what
the ministry described as a lengthy
discussion from experts on the safety of
the vaccines
according to a study that reviewed the
cases the second dose of the covet
vaccine was linked to cases
of mycocarditis or heart inflammation in
males aged 16 to 30
with the risk decreasing with age most
cases linked to the vaccine were mild
and lasted only a few days
the health ministry is directing the
campaign mainly at dolphins in the
high-risk category such as those
suffering from chronic diseases
and respiratory illnesses the job
however will be optional for healthy
teenagers
as of now
