Notice that two army planes of
Our country went to rescue
Our compatriots to Israel when
The first flight arrived there was a woman who
He had a moving gesture when he stepped on
Mexican soil our reporter David

Sedano Herminia originally from Michoacán
He was the first person to descend from
Mexican Air Force plane that
He left Israel in rescue mission and
Because of his emotion he incó to kiss the
Mexican soil that emotion of already
get off from seeing to see who is then
to kiss the Mexican soil first
for this for the emotion of having
returned from having returned this
Here the plane 737 800 registration 3528 of
The Mexican Air Force landed at
19:05 on the air base track
Military number one in Santa Lucía state

David B Curion of the city of Telavid
Faithful Catholic made for the first oon
His VI Israel to know the places in
Where was Jesus and the war came
When he was on the mount of the
Olivos as the impression that where we
grabbed was on the mount of olive trees in
Hexam in Heeman where Jesus Christ
cried and spilled blood this was
where we were in a mass in an hour
Santa and is where when we left they were
They gave us the news we were in
War and I never imagined that
That was going to grab that there
Hermina traveled only with her friends and
group companions who made the
Pilgrimage People of the Third
Age and adults from Sinaloa
narrated acan who suddenly saw each other
surrounded by terrorism ever very
very fatal because they tell us about
Let's take refuge to the hotel
Let's not leave if there has not been
your responsibility because it is a lot
as the pressure of one huh and well it was
very very very stressful now the
concern to know what they are still
Many Mexican pilgrims who
They remain in Israel in the middle of the
Attacks to the civilian population
concern that I would like
As they rescued me they will rescue them
all of them to all and but through
You do that management that there is
What to rescue them for image David
