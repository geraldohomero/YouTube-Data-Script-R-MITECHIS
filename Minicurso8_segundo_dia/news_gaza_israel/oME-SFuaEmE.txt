 
OF THIS TODAY ON THE WEATHER 
CHANNEL .  ANNE-MARIE, BACK TO 
YOU. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, JORDAN. 
>>>  TURNING BACK TO THE 
CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST,  
ISRAEL  CONTINUES TO ATTACK AND 
THERE IS NEW CONCERNS ABOUT 
VIOLENCE PAY ISRAEL SAID IT 
WOULD CARRY OUT STRIKES  IN 
LEBANON AND IAN LEE HAS MORE ON 
THE ESCALATING CONFLICT. 
>> Reporter: FEARS OF WAR ON 
THE BORDER IN THE TOP GENERAL  
INSPECTED YESTERDAY AND SAID 
HIS TROOPS ALREADY. 
ISRAEL FORCES  AND HEZBOLLAH 
TRADE FIRE ON A DAILY BASIS. 
TENSIONS ARE HIGH AFTER THE 
EXPLOSION IN BEIRUT TUESDAY. 
LAST NIGHT  THE VOWED REVENGE 
IN THESE THREATS ACROSS THE 
REGION. 
>> WE REMAIN CONCERNED, AS WE 
HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE RISK OF THE 
CONFLICT SPREADING.  
>> Reporter:  HERE IN THE 
OCCUPIED WEST BANK CITY THERE 
IS A GENERAL STRIKE. 
PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED . I ASKED 
THIS MAN WHAT HE THINGS OF THE 
KILLING AND HE SAID IT WAS A 
COWARDLY ATTACK AND NETANYAHU 
HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THE NEXT 
STAGE OF THE WAR . NEARLY 3 
MONTHS LATER, MUCH OF GAZA IS 
REDUCED TO RUBBLE AND ISRAEL 
CONTINUES TO EXPAND OPERATIONS, 
LEAVING PALESTINIANS KNOW WHERE 
TO GO . THE UNITED STATES IS 
WORKING HARD TO PREVENT THIS 
WAR FROM SPREADING. 
SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY 
BLINKEN IS ONCE AGAIN VISITING 
THE REGION OF THE WHITE HOUSE 
PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO 
INCREASE HUMANITARIAN AID . 
>> THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS 
HEADING TO THE REGION AGAIN. 
YOU IDENTIFIED MULTIPLE AREAS 
OF CONCERN. WHICH WOULD BE THE 
PRIOR TO THIS TIME AROUND?  
>> Reporter: SECRETARY OF STATE 
ANTONY BLINKEN IS TRYING  TO 
CONTIN THE BOYS IN GAZA TO 
MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T SPREAD TO 
OTHER PARTS OF THE REGION. 
TRYING TO UNITE EVERYONE ABOUT 
THE EFFORT AND TRYING TO KEEP 
THE REGION CALM.  ANOTHER THING 
THAT WE ARE EXPECTING FROM 
SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY 
BLINKEN IS MORE PRESSURE ON 
ISRAEL. 
THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO SEE 
ISRAEL SCALE BACK THE INTENSITY 
OF THE WAR  TO GO TO A MORE 
SURGICAL OPERATION AGAINST 
HAMAS. 
ISRAEL SAID THEY WOULD CONTINUE 
THIS WAR  UNTIL HAMAS IS 
DESTROYED . ANOTHER THING WE 
ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE 
LOOKING FOR IS THE DAY AFTER TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T 
HAPPEN AGAIN.
