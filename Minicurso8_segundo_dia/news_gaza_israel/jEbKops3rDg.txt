Listen to Cyril a situation
always very tense since you have it
said a dozen rockets were
drawn this morning on the localities of
North notably in Bettilel Kyouval
Mayayan Barour but also Kiryatch Mona
Kiryat Mona which is very often targeted
recently of the locality which is at
Barely 2 km from the border with the
Lebanon most of these rockets have
been intercepted but one of them
came across a house in Kiryat Mona
Without doing any injured and a little later
It is not the Rbola who has
claimed attacks but it is the
Hamas the Ezeddin Alkassam brigades so
Hamas' military branch Hamas
who told him that he had drawn a
quarantine of rockets and that one
of them had struck a base of
Ts of obviously
contradiction by the Israeli army and
A little later Tsal announced that he
had retaliated by targeting the source of
Army shots also announced that it
had targeted resbola positions at
Sud Lebanon We are talking about warehouse
ammunition of weapons production
military buildings therefore all these
infrastructure has been targeted
in the region to row so we see
Ciril that there is an intensification of
attacks on the northern border of Israel
since it is no longer just the
Rzbola who attacks northern Israel but
also the Ramas the Ramas which we know has
increased his presence in Lebanon and
parallel with the chief of staff of
The Israeli army Herti Alevi has a
again warned the Rbola
an additional RC warning
Alevier was visiting yesterday in the
localities in the north of Israel with the chief
of the northern command of the general
Horri Gordine and for Herti in Eevi it is
Clear the Rbola decided to join the
Ramas after the October 7 attack and
For that he will have to pay a very
heavy and he assured that tsal
made the right decisions to
Ensure the return of residents to their homes
Moved residents we talk about 80,000
inhabitants of the north who were moved
who have still not returned to
them and that thanks to these lebol actions
is closer to the border with
Israel and he added that Tsal will do
all the efforts necessary for
ensure the safety of its
residents
