With the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas
There is a lot of upheaval around the world
Due to this war, the world today two poles
I see Arab countries on one side
Standing against Israel and Russia
And if China is getting rich, then the same
Most western countries with America
Started in support of Israel
India has a middle way regarding this war
It is clear that Israel on Gaza
Arab countries are of Israel because of the attack of Israel
Russia and China are against are against
Humas is against Israel when Hamas
Israel was attacked by both countries
Hamas condemned this attack though
Now these two countries stand with Arab countries
Looks like
Russia and China are in the last few decades
China has become much better than Israel
Had invest in a large number of in Israel
Even after this, Russia and
To ignore Arab countries for China
It is not easy because Arab country Gaza Strip
Constant questions about Israel's attacks
Picking up and this military campaign from Israel
Russia is appealing to stop
And also fully supported Arab World from China
Russia is actually getting running with Ukraine
There is a lot of different after the battle
So there is a seeker to China Arab World
Want to fulfill strategic ambition
Let me tell you that Israel in the United Nations
The proposal that came on 11 November against
There were 145 votes in it, while only
Seven votes were cast against it in which
America was also involved, while voting on it
During this time 18 countries were absent
Voting during the proposal is clear
That Global South Arab World South America
And many countries in Europe stand against Israel
Russia and China are seen to take advantage of this
Want and showing a different talk to America
Want to perform great mobilization in the world
Although running between Israel and Hamas
How much Russia and China will be able to benefit in war
This is in the trough of the future but 7
After Hamas's attack on Israel on October
A lot has changed in the world
Times is Navana Bharat Digital
