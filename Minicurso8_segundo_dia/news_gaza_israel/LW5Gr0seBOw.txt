N
FREDERICTON SEES AND IT'S QUITE
COMMON, 1 OF THE REASON WHY WE
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REACT AS
QUICKLY AS WE DID IN JUST THE
LAST DAY OR SO, IS BECAUSE WE
HAVE PLENTY OF CONTINGENCY PLANS
IN THE WORKS AND IN FACT, A LOT
OF IT COMPLETE, BECAUSE WE WERE,
AND AS I SAID MANY TIMES FROM
THE PODIUM, WATCHING
CONSISTENTLY THE SECURITY
SITUATION ON THE GROUND.
SO I CAN GIVE YOU A BRIEF
UPDATED FEW ADDITIONAL DETAILS,
SINCE YESTERDAY.
NOW, AS I DO THIS, I THINK YOU
CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I'M NOT
GOING TO HAVE EVERY DETAIL THAT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO.
THERE IS OPERATIONAL SECURITY
THAT STILL GOING TO BE A CONCERN
AND WE ARE GOING TO OBSERVE THAT
HERE, JUST LIKE WE HAVE FOR THE
ENTIRE DRAWDOWN PROCESS.
I CAN TELL YOU A COUPLE OF
THINGS.
FIRST US FORCES AFGHANISTAN
FORWARD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE
SECURITY AT THE CABELL AIRPORT,
AND AT THE EMBASSY.
THESE ARE THE EXISTING SECURITY
ELEMENTS THAT WERE ALREADY IN
CABELL.
IT IS COMPRISED OF ATTACKED AND
LIST AVIATION SECURITY PERSONNEL
AND INTELLIGENCE SURROUNDING
RECONNAISSANCE EFFORTS THAT ARE
ALREADY THERE AT THE AIRPORT,
AND THEY STAY THERE, THEY ARE
STILL GOING-- DOING THEIR JOBS
IN TERMS OF INTERNAL SECURITY
THERE AT THE INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT.
THE TROOP MOVEMENTS THAT WE
MENTIONED YESTERDAY ARE
HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK.
3 BATTALIONS ARE PREPARING TO
MOVE FROM THEIR CURRENT
LOCATIONS IN THE CENTRAL COMMAND
AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY TO
CABELL.
THEY CONSIST OF A MARINE
BATTALION THAT WAS ALREADY
PRESTAGED IN THE REGION, AND HAS
LIFTED SUSTAINED CAPABILITIES,
AND ANOTHER MATURE -- MARINE
INFANTRY BATTALION FROM A MARINE
EXPEDITIONARY UNIT, AND THE U.S.
ARMY INFANTRY BATTALION.
NOW, SOME ELEMENTS OF 1 OF THE
MARINE INFANTRY BATTALIONS ARE
ALREADY THERE, IN CABELL, JUST
BELIEVE ME, THEY ARE THERE.
THE REST OF THEIR FORCES WILL
CONTINUE TO FLOW OVER THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS, AND I EXPECT TO
THAT BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND,
THE BULK OF THE 3,000 THAT WE
TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY WILL BE
IN PLACE.
PROBABLY NOT ALL BUT THE BOLT.
AND DUE TO THIS 82nd DIVISIO
