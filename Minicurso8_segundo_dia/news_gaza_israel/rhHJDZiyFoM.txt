There is not really a lot of
development if not the fact that this
soldier fell in Zeitun a district of
the city of Gaza in the northern sector of
The Gaza Strip on which the army
assumes operational control since
now more than 2 months old and yet he
there is uh a kind of insurrection I
would say terrorist cells from Hamas
which operates in groups of 2 tr or even 10
people
who harrass Israeli troops
who are on the ground and the army
Israeli is forced to make
maneuvers
targeted operations on these terrorists
The Zaitun district had been invested
in January and there is a
months and a half later and again he
For a week now or
even maybe a week and a half of
very close intense fights in this
district of the city of Gaza and therefore
losses in human life obviously on the side
of the Israeli army as on the side
Palestinian of course the problem
It is
that it shows in a certain way that
Ramas does not really commit
frontal against the Israeli army
undoubtedly to preserve his strength
No doubt to hope that the storm
will spend a beautiful day and that they will be able to
militarily reconstitute
that administering what is
obviously completely opposite the
goals from the Israeli army as they
are explained as an L motivates when
Prime Minister Benyamin Netaniaahou
talks about the total destruction of
the military and civil infrastructure of
Hamas in the Gaza Strip all
So is what is at stake an hour
current and Hamas wants to try to
preserve your forces for the day after
And so there are effects
harraaking which are sometimes deadly
like today
But if Hamas is no longer at
Order of 12 battalions in the
northern sector it would seem to remain
according to security sources that there is
about 5,000 Hamas fighters who
are still operational on an e of
Guer and no longer on a military mode
Organized thank you very much
