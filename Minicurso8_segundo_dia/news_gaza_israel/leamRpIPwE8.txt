>> Steve: WE'RE BACK WITH A FOX
NEWS ALERT.
THE UNITED STATES HAS LAUNCHED A
DRONE STRIKE IN NORTHERN IRAQ
KILLING FIVE IRANIAN PROXY
FIGHTERS, MEANWHILE IN THE RED
SEA, THE USS CARNEY SHOOTING
DOWN THREE DRONES COMING FROM
IRAN-BACKED HOUTHI REBELS ON
SUNDAY.
CHECK BACK IN WITH TREY YINGST
LIVE IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL WITH THE
LATEST.
WHAT IS GOING ON, TREY?
>> YEAH, CAN YOU HEAR IN THE
DISTANCE A LOT OF OUTGOING
ARTILLERY FIRE.
THE ISRAELIS ARE TARGETING THE
NORTHERN PART OF THE GAZA STRIP
WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE A LARGE
FIRE MISSION, LIKELY HITTING THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.
ONE OF THE LAST STRONGHOLDS IN
NORTHERN GAZA FOR HAMAS
FIGHTERS.
THEY HAVE BEEN GOING AFTER
LEADERSHIP THERE OVER THE PAST
SEVERAL DAYS.
WE ALSO CAN REPORT VIRILE FORCES
ARE OPERATING ON THE GROUND
CALLED KHAN YUNIS.
TELLING CIVILIANS PREVIOUSLY
USING THE ROAD TO MOVE FROM THE
NORTHERN PART OF GAZA TO THE
SOUTH.
NOT TO USE THAT EVACUATION
CORRIDOR RIGHT NOW.
THEY ARE POINTING THEM TO THE
SEE TO EVACUATE CLOSE TO THEIR.
THERE IS CLEARLY SOME
SIGNIFICANT GROUND FIGHTING
TAKING PLACE.
AND THEY SAY THEY ARE PAUSING
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THAT
SOUTHERN CITY OF RAFAH TO ALLOW
FOR HUMANITARIAN EVACUATION TO
GET AS MANY CIVILIANS OUT OF THE
WAY RIGHT NOW.
THIS COMES AS THE ISRAELIS ARE
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE HOSTAGES
THAT WERE HELD INSIDE GAZA.
AS YOU CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT
ARTILLERY IN THE STANCE.
I DO WANT YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN
TO THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT WHO HAD THIS TO SAY
ABOUT WHAT THEY LEARNED.
>> SO TRAUMA MOO TIDES BY OVER
50 DAYS OF CAPTIVITY THAT SHE
REFUSES TO LET GO OF HER MOTHER
EVEN TO LET HER GO TO THE
BATHROOM AT HOME.
DOCTORS ARE ATTESTING TO THE
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HEALTH OF
THESE SURVIVORS, SAYING THEY
HAVE, QUOTE, NEVER SEEN SUCH
TERRIBLE HYGIENE AS THE
CONDITIONS IN WHICH HAMAS
RETURNED THE HOSTAGES.
>> AS THE ISRAELIS CONTINUE TO
SEARCH FOR THE HOSTAGES STILL
INSIDE GAZA.
THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT
COMES NEXT FOR THE GROUND
OPERATION.
THEY ARE NOW PUTTING PRESSURE ON
THE NORTHERN PART, THE CENTRAL
PART, AND THE SOUTHERN PART OF
THE GAZA STRIP.
YOU HAVE GOT 2 MILLION CIVILIANS
THAT OUTGOING ARTILLERY RIGHT
NOW TARGETING THE NORTHERN PART
OF GAZA BUT, AGAIN, THE QUESTION
HERE IS WHERE WILL THOSE
CIVILIANS GO AS THE GROUND AND
AIR SEPARATIONS EXPA
