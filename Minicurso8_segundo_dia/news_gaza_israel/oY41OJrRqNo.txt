clashes have broken out every night
since the start of the holy month of
ramadan
this after authority set up a barricade
at damascus gate a traditional
gathering spot a far-right jewish group
meanwhile
were blocked after leading a march of
hundreds of protesters chanting arabs
get out for more on this story we can go
across the france 24's iris macklin
standing by
in jerusalem for us iris what started
all of this
you know it's quite interesting it's
difficult to
put your finger on anything other than
the fact that there's an
underlying tension here all the time and
all you need is a small match for
it to burst into flame and so what we
saw was that
palestinians were not allowed to come
and pray at al-aqsa during ramadan
in the numbers that they usually do that
was covered related we saw palestinian
youth who
after the iftar the breakfast meal in
the evening in ramadan
always hang out at the damascus gate
that was closed to them
they didn't like that and their response
was to find
um israelis often ultra-orthodox jews
who were in the old city going to pray
they'd beat them up
and they'd upload those photos to
tick-tock that brought the police to
them
and that brought the um the right-wing
israeli groups the ultra-nationalist
groups to them too
so every day this week we've seen in
increasing numbers and increasing
nastiness
uh confrontations between the two street
fights i'd call them
um and then last night which was the
largest night so far
the police separated the two groups and
they were injured on both sides
and is this all likely to escalate
further
it's very hard to predict i would say at
the moment
certainly on the jewish side um there
were two to three hundred protesters
they're marginalized
they're not mainstream but if you know
it doesn't take much here that's the
thing if this continues night after
night you could bring other people
in and i think that's the danger when it
stops being marginalized youth on each
side
and if there's any other reason for
example let's say the cancellation
or the postponement of elections in the
palestinian authority that's something
that is being spoken about
that could be a match that would start
something much bigger
