more anguish
and now more death a scene all too
familiar here
and sadly almost inevitable where a
series of events have brought
tensions to boiling point
[Applause]
following days of violence in jerusalem
more confrontations
early monday hundreds were injured in
clashes with israeli police
at the alaska mosque islam's third
holiest site
sitting on judaism's sacred temple mount
worshipers stayed after morning prayers
to defend the mosque against a march of
jewish activists marking jerusalem day
the anniversary of israel's annexation
of the east of the city
the march was rerouted monday was also a
day where an israeli
court was due to hear the case of the
proposed eviction of palestinian
families
in the nearby sheikh jarrah neighborhood
the hearing
was postponed i think the temple mount
is the place where nationalism and
religion meet
this applies to jews as well as
muslims and it's a tinderbox to put it
bluntly
some zionist israeli lawmakers headed
into sheikh jarrah
ramping up tensions further they don't
accept the fact that jews
can be can go and on their holiest site
the temple mount we are standing with
palestinian families
in gerard against
the evacuation plan and then
later in the day rockets fired from gaza
toward jerusalem
leading to israeli air strikes in
response
killing gazans including children and a
hamas commander
at a jerusalem day event israeli prime
minister benjamin netanyahu warned
the current confrontation may last a
while
this latest crisis arguably a political
gift for the long-time leader
facing corruption charges and clinging
on to power after
another inconclusive election redmond
