it was a busy day for israeli diplomacy
german foreign minister hekomas paid a
visit
the main item on his agenda was israel's
plan to seize large parts of the west
bank it wants to annex palestinian lands
where jewish settlements have been built
after a meeting with israeli's new
foreign minister gabiash kanasi the
german diplomat called the plant
annexation illegal but stopped short of
threatening sanctions
together with the european union we
believe an annexation would not be
compatible with international law that's
why we continue to support a mutual
two-state solution
it's not only germany and the european
union calling an annexation illegal
the organization of islamic cooperation
has also condemned it
we retariate the organization's position
and total support for the palestinian
people in their just struggle to regain
their legitimate rights those include
the right of return and forming an
independent sovereign state on the
borders of june 4th 1967
with east jerusalem as their capital
israelis neighbors have also warned
against annexation
jordan and egypt are the only two arab
states that have peace treaties and
diplomatic relations with israel egypt's
foreign minister warner's annexation
could spark never dangerous round of
violence in the region jordan shares 300
kilometer border with israel it's
threatened to review its peace
agreements with israel if the annexation
goes through
former israeli diplomat along leo says
what jordan decides to do will be the
most crucial reaction for israel the
diplomatic link
i don't think jordan can afford breaking
it
but if they will it's an earthquake
because this will affect egypt too the
rest of the world doesn't matter so much
europe
is paralyzed because of the east-west
relations in europe
uh
and also because germany is leading
europe now and they're leading the
security now and german foreign policy
is always paralyzed
when it comes to actions against israel
what lands will be annexed is uncertain
yet
but israeli media reports that starting
july the first prime minister benimi
netanyahu will delay most of the land
seizures and will enact parts of the
occupied west bank gradually
another question remaining is exactly
how the international community will
respond muslim fathers trt world
occupied is jerusalem
