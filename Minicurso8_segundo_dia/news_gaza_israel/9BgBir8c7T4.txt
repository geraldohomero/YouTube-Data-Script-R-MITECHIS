LOT GOING ON ACROSS THE REGION,
NONE OF IT PARTICULARLY GOOD.
>> NO.
AND WE HAVE THE MAJOR NEWS OUT
OF FLORIDA AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL
DEVELOPMENTS IN TRUMP'S TRIALS
BUT FIRST GO TO ISRAEL.
THE WORLD CENTRAL AID KITCHEN
ORGANIZATION SAID SEVEN WORKERS
WERE KILLED YESTERDAY IN AN
ISRAELI AIR STRIKE IN GAZA.
IN A STATEMENT THE CHARITY SAID
A CONVOY CARRYING WORKERS WAS
STRUCK LEAVING A WAREHOUSE WHERE
AIDE WAS DROPPED OFF.
AMONG THOSE KILLED WAS AN
AMERICAN WHO POSSESSED DUAL
CITIZENSHIP WITH CANADA.
THE ORGANIZATION SAID IT IS
PAUSING ITS OPERATIONS IN THE
REGION.
THE IDF SAID IT WAS CONDUCTING A
THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE TRAGIC
INCIDENT.
MEANWHILE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
REPORTS IRANIAN OFFICIALS CLAIM
TWO GENERALS AND FIVE OFFICERS
WERE KILLED IN AN AIR STRIKE IN
SYRIA YESTERDAY.
THE TIMES OF ISRAEL REPORTS ONE
OF THOSE KILLS WAS AN IRAN
REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORE SENIOR
MOST OFFICIAL IN SYRIA.
FOUR ISRAELI OFFICIALS CONFIRMED
ISRAEL LAUNCHED THE STRIKE,
ISRAEL HAS NOT OFFICIALLY
COMMENTED.
IT HAPPENED THE SAME DAY ISRAEL
AND THE U.S. MET FOR VIRTUAL
TALKS TO DISCUSS ALTERNATIVES TO
A GROUND INVASION OF RAFAH.
LET'S BRING IN COLUMNIST DAVID
IGNATIUS.
BREAK DOWN WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
AT THE SAME TIME OF ALL OF THIS
WE'RE SUPPLYING MILITARY AID TO
ISRAEL, IS THIS BECOMING MORE
COMPLICATED FOR THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION?
>> LET ME JUST SAY A WORD ABOUT
THE TRAGIC DEATHS OF THE WORLD
CENTRAL KITCHEN VOLUNTEERS.
TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS WITH CHEF
JOSE ANDRES WHO RUNS THIS
WONDERFUL CHARITABLE
ORGANIZATION AND HE WAS
PASSIONATE.
OCCASIONALLY TO THE POINT OF
TEARS IN SPEAKING ABOUT THE
HUMANITARIAN NEED OF THE PEOPLE
HIS WORKERS WERE GOING TO SERVE
IN GAZA.
IT'S A TRAGEDY TO SEE THESE
