one issue was this issue of settler
violence which is not really discussed
within israeli society and what i saw
through my view from the operations room
was time and again how
acts of violence against palestinians
are just under rug swept and
and covered up by the military that
doesn't enforce the law on violent
settlers so the fact that you're
in occup that you're occupying
palestinian territory that's the
root of the problem there cannot be an
occupation that will be moral or that
you know will conduct itself in a good
way
it's the you know the problem is
inherent in in the mission and the
mission is
occupying people without without them
having rights and dignity and without
them
be you know choosing to be under this uh
control
you've witnessed abuses then or you've
witnessed things you're
unhappy with have you been a part of
that yourself and that you reflected on
afterwards
i've gotten orders and given orders to
my own soldiers that i
later regretted i'll give you an example
of something very systematic
there were a couple of times where my
commanders gave us a box of flashbang
grenades
and they just told us to start throwing
them out of the driving car
when i asked why they told us to make
the palestinians understand who owns
this place
did you feel that you're being that the
officers
and the israeli army were asking you to
do something that you obviously felt
really uncomfortable with but you were
not in a position to say no
when he was in the army i think that for
the most cases i did feel comfortable
with what i was doing and that's because
i was convinced that it was for the
security of israel and what we do in
breaking the silence is ask
questions far beyond just security like
what is the moral price
for that security is that the kind of
security we want to live with as a
society
now i know that that isn't what i want
my
society to be doing and i know that it
that the occupation isn't justified in
any moral terms so from
my own experiences i know that this
occupation needs to end i know that it
has nothing to do with the morality we
expect from ourselves
