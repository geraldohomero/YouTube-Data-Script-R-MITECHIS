We continue talking about this situation
this war that is being lived between
Israel and the group never and also
Hezbollah are different the powers that
They are also part of this conflict and
Who spoke was the Minister of Defense
by Israel Joab Galant that said so much
Never like Ges Bol√° will take advantage of the
Ramadan date to destabilize and
What he said promptly is that they are going to
seek to turn it into a second phase
of the plan that began on October 7 with
emphasis on the mountain of the temple and
Jerusalem Joab Galant is the Minister of
Defense as I said and estimated that Iran
Never and Jesus will use this month
Sacred the Sacred Month of Islam the
Ramadan to generate violence in S
Jordan and in Jerusalem that are the ones
The main objective of
It is never to take the Ramadan and convert it
In a second phase of the plan that began
On October 7 with emphasis on the mountain
of the temple and in Jerusalem was what
The official said the Israelis call
Mount of the temple to what the Palestinians
They consider the esplanade of the mosques
where is the Alcaza mosque in
The old city of Jerusalem this
busy is the most sacred place
For Judaism and is third place
most sacred for Muslims the site
most emblematic of the Palestinian conflict
Israel last week never urged
The Palestinians of East Jerusalem and
sis Jordan to rebel before any
criminal measure that prohibits entry
In the Alcaz Mosque the main
Objective of ever was what
Galant said is being amplified by
Iran and Jebol we should never give it
that has not been able to achieve since the
Beginning of the war was also part
What he said when warning
irresponsible statements that could
be
