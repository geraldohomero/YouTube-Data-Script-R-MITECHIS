 MILITANT FROM HEZBOLLAH FIRING 
 ROCKETS INTO NORTHERN ISRAEL.
 STUART: GOT IT.
 THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED.
 VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS 
 MET WITH NETANYAHU'S RIVAL AT 
 THE WHITE HOUSE MONDAY.
 SHE ONCE AGAIN CALLED FOR A 
 CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA.
 KT MCFARLAND, WHAT IS AMERICA'S
 POLICY WITH ISRAEL, AND WHO 
 MAKES IT?
 THE PRESIDENT OR THE VICE 
 PRESIDENT?
 >> Reporter: THIS IS MADE BY 
 THE CAMPAIGN.
 THE PRO-PALESTINIAN MUSLIM 
 POPULATION, UNTIL PRESIDENT 
 BIDEN, IN THE GENERAL ELECTION.
 AND THEY HAVE A GOOD 
 RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL.
 AND GET DEMOCRAT VOTERS IN 
 THOSE SWING STATES.
 AND A BIGGER WAR IN THE MIDDLE 
 EAST.
 STUART: GENERAL JACKING IS 
 RETIRED, 4-STAR GENERAL, THEY 
 GET A BETTER DEAL IF -- 
 >> USED PRESSURE UNTIL THE 
 ISRAELIS TO GET THE HOSTAGES 
 OUT.
 I DO THINK THERE WILL BE A 
 DEAL.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY WHICH 
 HAMAS KNOWS THAT ISRAEL WILL 
 BEGIN COMBAT OPERATIONS AND 
 
                             
 RAFFA.
 THEY ARE DOWN TO THE FINAL 
 POINTS.
 HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE BECAUSE 
 IT IS IN BOTH PARTIES 
 INTERESTS.
 STUART: WHAT DO YOU THINK WE 
 SHOULD DO?
 TELL THE ISRAELIS DO WHAT YOU 
 GOT TO DO TO BEAT HAMAS OR 
 PULLBACK?
 WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
 KT:IT IS THE BIN LADEN 
 STRATEGY.
 THEY WANT TO PREVENT AN ISRAELI
 VICTORY TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.
 AFTER SEPTEMBER 11TH AMERICAN 
 FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN, AND 
 THREE MONTHS AT A LAMINATED 90%
 OF AL QAEDA, THEY WENT ACROSS 
 TO PAKISTAN WHERE THEY 
 REGROUPED, RESUPPLIED, 
 RECALCULATED AND 20 YEARS, THAT
 IS WHAT HAMAS WANTS TO DO, IT 
 WINS BY LOSING.
 IT JUST NEEDS TO STAY ALIVE TO 
 FIGHT ANOTHER DAY AND WENT TO 
 PREVENT ISRAEL OR DELAY ISRAEL 
 FROM GOING INTO RADDA
  BECAUSE THAT COULD FINISH OFF 
 THE LEADERSHIP.
 STUART: WHEN WILL THE 
 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COME 
 AROUND THE AND SAY 
 HOSTAGETAKING IS IMMORAL, 
 WRONG, DISGUSTING, WILL IT SAY 
 ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
 >> NOT IF IT IS ISRAELI 
 HOSTAGES.
 THEY'VE BEEN HOSTILE THROUGHOUT
 AND THAT'S PART OF HAMAS.
 THEY MIGHT BEAT THEM IN THE 
 COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.
 THAT'S WHY THE LONGER THIS 
 GOES, THE MORE CASUALTIES WHICH
 HAMAS IS HAPPY TO HAVE, THEY 
 WANT TO MAKE ISRAEL LOOK LIKE 
 THE BAD GUY.
 STUART: IT IS JUST DISGUSTING 
 IN MY OPINIO
