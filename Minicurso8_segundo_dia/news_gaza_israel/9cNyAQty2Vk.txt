The Alchifa Hospital crosses a serious
crisis the largest medical complex in
Gaza is the target according to Hamas
of Israeli attacks repeated
thousands of people are blocked
trapped fighting that
concentrate in the heart of the city of Gaza
result of the deaths of the wounded and
out of breath of breath lacking
material and especially fuel for
feed the generators who
provide electricity to the army
Israeli claims to have deposited 300 L
fuel in front of the hospital for
urgent medical needs and point of
finger the Hamas that would prevent the hospital
receive
help they offered to take
300 l at 2 a.m. and put them in
middle of the road far from the hospital
under the bombings of planes and
tank they told us to come with a
ambulance and take the fuel
I proposed to send it by
The intermediary of the Red Cross but
The hospital needs a good amount
the larger we need 8 to
10,000 l of fuel per day the 300 L
That is not enough for what this
either the hospital calls organizations
international and government
Egyptian to evacuate civilians at most
quickly the Israeli army claims that the
Hamas has placed centers of
command under hospitals while
ensuring everything you need
To save them
civilians we opened roads
Between northern and southern hospitals
We discuss with directors
hospitals and offer them to
helping to move is patients to
their safety the residents of the band
North listen to Tsal calls and
run south although Hamas F
Everything for
retain on the 36 hospitals in the band
of Gaza only 20 still work
According to the U in the south also the situation
stays tense like here in Hanunes where the
