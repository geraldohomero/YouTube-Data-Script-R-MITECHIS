Iran the Iranian authorities therefore
begin to speak and therefore the
authorities administer any attack not
only domicile but any attack in
general coming from outside according to a
army spokesperson in fact the
explosion noises that we heard at
Hispon was due to the entry into action of
anti-aircraft defense system against
Suspicious flying objects uh rather
Iranian media had claimed that
Three small flying objects uh had
was therefore shot in the Isparan region
In the mouths of the Iranians it designates
rather not drones but
hichots or quadcopters therefore
small flying objects uh you have to know
that in the past Iran had affirmed
that
Uh an industrial site had been
struck with a hichot in this
Same region disappearing so we are there
For the moment therefore the authorities
demisen any attack and say say
that even the activity therefore traffic
Aerial as well interior
that international has become normal again and
that all airports in Tran but also
in the provinces have resumed their activities
After a suspension of about 2 hours
So for Tran everything is normal and therefore
There has been no attack since
The exterior Siavoch he has a lot
question this last heur disappearing
Why is Isparant why we have
might as well
Isparant it's very simple it is
Really the heart uh of industry
Iranian nuclear there is also
Natin entertainment which is the most
Great Sitite of the country's closet
even shelters other sites
nuclear there is also it is
also a very
very important but there are also
very important military bases at
Ispaan and also missile bases
Uh, which are located in the region
therefore what does what makes
of paran therefore a potential C for
Israel but also possibly
United States in the event of war or
open conflict
