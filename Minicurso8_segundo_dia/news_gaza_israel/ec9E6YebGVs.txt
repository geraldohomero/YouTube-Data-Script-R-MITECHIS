Operations have been canceled or whether it
Companies south their cargo ships

Which can cause a new disaster

Companies to avoid land attacks
From the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea from Ira Rile

Through the continent through a long way
Sending ships and because of this

It is deserted because now the Red Sea
Completeer ship Israel's sports via Israeli
