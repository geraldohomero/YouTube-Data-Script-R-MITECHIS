this is as close as allah now comes to
the board of fence
he's afraid of what might happen if he
gets any closer
on the first day of the gaza strips
great march of return march the 30th
last year he was shot by an israeli
sniper and lost his leg

i feel afraid because i heard the same
bullet sound when i was injured it
reminds me of the pain
it reminds me of what i went through and
the wound i had on the first day
allah is one of the thousands of
palestinians to be injured by israeli
forces over the last 14 months
more than 250 palestinians have been
killed
at the protests people from gaza have
been calling for the right for
palestinian refugees to return to the
land their ancestors lived on across the
border in what today is israel
they also want an end to the israeli-led
blockade on the territory
but israel calls the protesters
dangerous
and says gaza's ruler hamas a group
israel considers a terrorist
organization is the main driver behind
them
i don't know if any army would do
anything differently if you had to
protect your border against people who
say we're going to destroy you and we're
going to flood into your country you try
other means you try all sorts of means
you try
non-lethal means and they don't work so
you're left with
bad choices
but those choices hurt people like allah
who's a cyclist
before losing his leg he was a member of
the palestinian national cycling team
training for the asian games
it would have been an opportunity for
him to finally take a trip outside the
small confines of the gaza strip
but instead he's had to adjust his
thinking
i couldn't represent palestine with two
legs
but hopefully i can do it with one
of course allat still has hopes and
dreams but
living in gaza
they're hard to fulfill
abu bakr
