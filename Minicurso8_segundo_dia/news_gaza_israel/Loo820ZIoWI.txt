Israel has given Gaza Strip to several days
Aerial attacks are surrounded by all sides
After now preparation for the fight on the ground
Israel is doing the seventh day of war
Restored 750 military bases of Gaza
Has given its tank for ground proceedings
Despite all this on the border
This war is not easy for Israel
Is his fight not just with Hamas
There are many enemies on his own boundaries
One such one is hovering from all sides
The danger is lebbing, yes there may be good
The fight is not going straight but the atmosphere
Lebanese is completely rusty
Terrorist organization Hizbullah is also in this war
It is desperate to jump like this like this
The organization also has the support of Iran
Right now helping Hamas but of war
This organization has not landed on the field at the moment
Right now only on the border but at any time
It can get into the war of Israel
Political and military leaders where next
If you are considering the step, then their
Jums are also resting on Hizbullah
Palestine in Lebanon at the time of prayer
Performed vigorous in support
Women also participated in this way Israel
Lebanon burning in the fire of revenge against
There has been a big threat to him

Have paid but this time the challenge is bigger
So he is not just seeing the Gaza Strip
Keeping but the tricks of every enemy
Trying to understand and that
This is the reason why
Israel made an air attack from Syria
This ruined the main air arms
Israeli after Hamas's attack on Israel
Army was the first aerial attack on Syria
After Israel's attacks, the capital Damascus and
At airports in northern city Aleppo
Syria had to stop flying at this time
It has happened to Israel from Muslim countries
Talking about attacking those countries

Is Israel to his enemies
