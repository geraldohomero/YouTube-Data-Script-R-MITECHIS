palestinian journalist mohamed el deje
was in gaza to cover protesters at the
great march of return
he says he wanted to report on how
israeli forces were trying to disable
protesters by shooting them below the
knees with live ammunition
then
an explosive bullet shattered both of
his legs
i was a little bit away from the
dividing fence suddenly i was shot it
hit my right leg and went into my left
leg at that moment i felt electricity
through my whole body it was constant
pain i tried to resist and stand up but
i couldn't
since march palestinians have been
protesting in gaza every week
according to the palestinian health
ministry almost 6 000 of the protesters
who've been shot by israeli forces have
been hit in the lower leg
the israeli army says it opens fire as a
last resort against palestinians
throwing rocks grenades and fire bombs
and it says aiming for the legs is an
act of restraint
but adults aren't the only targets
we document about
95
cases who were shot by the israeli
forces by using explosive bullets
they were underwent to
amputation
surgery and this number is including 17
children but the humanitarian
organization doctors without borders
says explosive bullets are not a form of
restraint and cause wounds and fractures
that can easily get infected aid groups
say the israeli military is violating
international law by using live
ammunition which they say amounts to
excessive force and they say it's often
used against peaceful protesters
we were hanging out and we found a place
to sit i was lighting a cigarette and
suddenly i was shot i blacked out and
woke up in the hospital
muhammad says he was clearly marked as a
member of the press on the day he was
shot and he has something to say to the
international community
my message to them is to open
investigations into the crimes against
the palestinians by the israeli
occupation especially regarding
intentional injuries to any part of the
body legs torso or head
he won't be able to cover more protests
anytime soon and many more won't even be
able to protest at all
