for years
Year especially since the Israeli Proclamation
on
1948 which sparked conflicts
afterwards including occupation
Palestine but until Muhammed was aged
23 years of war this time
the first time you are talking about people who
Witnessed many wars in their lives but
This time it is different and it is more
Cruel many innocent people are dying and
