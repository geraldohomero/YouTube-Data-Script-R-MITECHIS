children executed in front of their
parents and so many taken hostage in
Gaza we have to
ask indeed it must be
asked where is the
outrage where is the revulsion where is
the rejection where is the explicit
condemnation of these
Horrors we must affirm the right of Any
Nation to defend itself and to prevent
such horror from repeating itself no
member of this Council no nation in this
entire body could or would tolerate the
slaughter of its
people as this Council and the UN
General Assembly have repeatedly
affirmed all acts of terrorism are
unlawful and
unjustifiable they're unlawful and
unjustifiable whether they target people
in Nairobi or Bali in Luxor Istanbul or
Mumbai in New York or kubet or cubet
Berry they're unlawful and
unjustifiable whether they're carried
out by ISIS by boo Haram by al-shabab by
lashar TBA or by
Hamas they're unlawful and
unjustifiable whether victims are
targeted for their faith their ethnicity
their nationality or any other
reason and this Council has a
responsibility to denounce member states
that arm that fund and train Hamas or
any other terrorist group that carries
out such horrific
acts let's not forget that among the
more than 1,400 people that Hamas killed
on October 7 were citizens from more
than 30 UN member States including many
of the members around this very table
the victims included at least 33
American
citizens every one of us has a stake
every one of us has a responsibility in
defeating
terrorism
second we all agree on the vital need to
protect
civilians as President Biden has made
clear from the outset of this crisis
while Israel has the right indeed the
obligation to defend
itself
