WE APPRECIATE YOUR JOINING US
THIS MORNING.
>> YES, MA'AM.
>> THANKS.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
>>> RICHARD AND MARTIN, IN TERMS
OF THE HOPE FOR THESE HOSTAGES,
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLE
SITUATION.
WITH THESE REPORTS ESPECIALLY
NOW THAT SOME MAY HAVE ALREADY
PERISHED.
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE.
MARTIN WILL KNOW MORE THE
DETAILS THAN I WILL.
BUT ISRAEL HAS A LONG HISTORY OF
BEING WILLING TO EXCHANGE IN
ORDER TO GET ITS PEOPLE BACK.
>> THEY WANT 1,000 PRISONERS FOR
ONE.
>> IT'S ONE-SIDED.
I ACTUALLY THINK BEFORE THIS
IS -- YOU HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE
THAN I DO AT THIS, I'M
CURIOUS -- BUT I THINK THERE
WILL BE EXCHANGES.
>> REALLY?
>> I THINK THERE IS A DECENT
CHANCE.
LOOK, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO LOSE THEIR LIVES, I
UNDERSTAND THAT.
IT'S JUST GOING TO ADD TO THE
TRAGEDY.
BUT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT
HAMAS TOOK SO MANY HOSTAGES,
AGAIN, WAS TO SET UP SOME
EXCHANGE.
>> HAVE POWER.
>> AGAIN, I THINK ISRAEL WILL BE
WILLING TO, DESPITE HOW AWFUL
IT'S BEEN AND HOW EVIL HAMAS HAS
BEEN.
I STILL THINK THERE WOULD BE A
WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT IN ORDER
TO SAVE HUMAN LIFE.
>> MARTIN?
>> FIRST, WHEN HAMAS TODAY SAYS
THAT 13 HOSTAGES ARE BEING
KILLED, IT MAY BE TRUE, IT MAY
NOT BE TRUE.
COULD BE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE,
WE DON'T KNOW.
>> YEAH.
>> YEAH, ISRAEL IS HOLDING 5,000
PALESTINIAN SECURITY PRISONERS
IN ITS JAILS.
PLENTY MORE PALESTINIANS.
MORE SECURITY REASONS, 5,000
PEOPLE, OF WHOM ONLY 183 COME
FROM GAZA.
IF THERE IS A RELEASE, BY THE
WAY, THAT MEANS ONLY 183 FROM
GAZA.
THAT MEANS THE REST WILL GO HOME
TO THE WEST BANK.
YOU HAVE, LIKE, 4,800 ODD
RELEASED PRISONERS GOING TO THE
WEST BANK, AND MANY OF THOSE
WILL REVERT TO THEIR OLD WAYS.
THIS IS A REAL THREAT TO ISRAEL
IF IT GOESZ THROUGH.
I AGREE WITH RICHARD.
EXACTLY, HAMAS TOOK THOSE
HOSTAGES IN ORDER TO, AS THEY
SAID OPENLY, TO FREE ALL THEIR
