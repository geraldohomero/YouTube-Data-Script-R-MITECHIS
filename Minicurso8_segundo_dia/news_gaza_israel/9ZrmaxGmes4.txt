The march began in Tel Aviv five days ago with 
around 100 people but this was the size of the  
crowd arriving in Jerusalem. 
Thousands joining the final  
stretch of the 70 kilometre walk 
For families of hostages, it felt  
as though an entire nation was behind them. 
The whole Israel around us. The whole citizens  
of Israel is behind us, with us and this is a 
force. This is what will count in the end. 
 
The human convoy converging on the Israeli 
Prime Minister's office...their message clear. 
 
'Bring them home' 
This is the largest the rally since  
the hostages were taken by Hamas. 
A sign of the increasing  
pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu.
Stevie Kerem: It’s impossible that there  
are 240 kidnapped people and the government, our 
government isn’t talking to them, isn’t telling  
them what’s going on, what’s on the table, 
what’s on offer, what are the reasons for and  
against. Nothing! Nobody is talking to them.    
Families have urged the Israeli government to do  
everything possible to return their loved 
ones. For some, this includes a prisoner  
swap --- others want a ceasefire.
That's what this crowd in Tel  
Aviv is calling for.  
The US - which along with  
Qatar is seeking to negotiate a deal - 
says there would be a "significant pause"  
in fighting if hostages are released.
President Joe Biden has acknowledged he's  
"hopeful" of reaching an outcome --  
he's now turning to Gaza's future.
 
In an opinion piece published in 
the Washington Post he wrote: 
 
But Prime Minister Netanyahu has made clear 
the Palestinian Authority "in its current  
form" cannot guarantee security.
A long-held concern, including  
among these Holocaust survivors who 
gathered at a memorial in Paris.
 
In the Jewish life, it’s not ‘never 
again’ , it’s ‘always again.']]    
 
They say they won't let history repeat itself.
