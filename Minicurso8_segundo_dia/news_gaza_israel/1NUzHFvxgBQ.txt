under intense pressure this is the
director speaking live now at the
shiffer hospital let's listen
in during particularly during the last
two days where no communication and no
internet they have demolished more than
32,000

the civilians the residential areas
and different social
categories when it comes to the Medical
Teams more than
116 medical staff have lost their
lives the civil defense units have lost
18 of their men the journalist who cover
the
war have been also targeted 35

bombarding all the community with
without

880 government building and other social
organization the occupation has
destroyed since the start of the war
