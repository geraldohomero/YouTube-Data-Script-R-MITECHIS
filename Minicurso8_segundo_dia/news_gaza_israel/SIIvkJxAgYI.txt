a wakeup call before a day of
fasting but this Ramadan the Century's
old tradition rings out differently in
nablas we remind people of what's
happening in Gaza to remember they sleep
without breakfast without homes without
anything fear is everywhere in Naas
Israel forces have arrested and tortured
so many
these are the Masarati or drummers they
used to March through the old city
Before Dawn but with an increased
Israeli military presence it's too
dangerous so they remain on the
outskirts trying to bring joy to a
grieving
community in the past 2 years Israeli
forces have killed more than 140
Palestinians in
nablas during Ramadan the old city is
famous across the occupied West Bank for
its thousands of twinkling lights and
lanterns every year we put up
decorations and clean the streets to
observe Ramadan this year we didn't
because of what's happening in Gaza and
those who have been killed in
nablas as daylight arrives and fasting
begins instead of traditional
decorations the streets are full of
placards images of young Palestinians
killed by Israeli forces it's not just
the lack of decorations usually during
Ramadan thousands of Palestines and
tourists will pour into the city often
to buy these seasonal sweets the cues
would be long and the streets bustling
now look it's easy to move around and
the atmosphere is markedly different
tucked away in a maze of Alleyways are
the sweet shops treats that are a
Mainstay on dinner
tables we've been here for more than 50
years but now streets looks sad there
are no decorations and we miss the young
men who were killed they are all
family shops here are also known for
this cheesy dessert canfa but with few
customers businesses are
struggling the war in Gaza changed the
situation in Naas we had 70% more
business before the economic situation
is tough and the city is
sad people here say the holy month is
even more significant this year a fast
to empathize with those hungry and
suffering in Gaza luran Al jazer nablas
