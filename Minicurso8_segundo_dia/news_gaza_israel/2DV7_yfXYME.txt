Well it is really terrible because
There is also so much material of this
war that one can listen to how
Only the screams for example of
pain the cry of the victims of this
Conflict that eh is permanently
climbing we continue reviewing the figure
Dead and injured a follow -up that
It becomes difficult sometimes because I know
It permanently updates this
Information during the last hours
They registered new air attacks on
The Gaza Strip are Israeli attacks
A man was literally talent to the
bodies of his cousin and daughter
pregnant who died in an attack
Israeli aerial were tieding the part
from above his car and this did
Before embarking on a trip to the
North of Gaza in this attack in question
The images are terrible is really
E can hurt sensitivity because
They are real images are not images that
They are taken daily there that are collected
To be able to show the world what it is like
The situation at this time there in the
gauze strip for that is
impressionable dozens of people
The last air attack died in this
residents say they cannot bury
to the dead in the cemeteries because
The bombings continue and one does not
You can surely move on the fanja of
Gaza then there are many who are
fleeing directly or how did this
man carrying the bodies of his
deceased relatives to another part of
This territory the forces of Israel
They aim to locate and
disable the vast network of tunnels of
The militants ever under this
enclave just what is believed to
there are and that's why bombings
The
next phase of an Israeli offensive
who has killed thousands of Palestinians is
continue with more bombing with which
This postcard we are seeing now
can be replicated during the next
days
