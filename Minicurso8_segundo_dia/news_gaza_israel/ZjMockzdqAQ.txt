Help victims how to help
civilians without strengthening the diets that
oppress this question all
humanitarian workers pose it is
particularly sensitive in the band
of Gaza in France she divides
political representatives of different
edges as at
Senate the inhabitants of Gaza cannot
have the double pain already they live
under dictatorship of Hamas we are for
Maintaining union aid
European as soon as aid have
no vocation of something other than helping
civilian populations the hospitals ensure
Electricity or food scure
Otherwise you add despair to
Despair you can't pay the rope
with which we are going to be hanged is a
good thing to suspend the aid it
You have to see how to help the population
civilian but differently and not to help
Terrorists the European Union is
the biggest contributor to support
Palestinians' financiers according to the
European service for action
Outdoor 1Dillard2000 â‚¬ are planned
for the period 2021-2024 half of
this instead of sleep has already been paid in
2021 and 2022 The managers assure it
No euro is paid directly to
Hamas but but how to make sure that
Concrete humanitarian impact surpasses
some perverse effects like when
Palestinian local agents are
works assistance programs in
schools financed through the UN with
attempts to indoor the
youth what would happen if the
main donors decide to stop
to pay it is that the right
humanitarian and Geneva conventions
oblige the occupying power to
Guarantee the well-being of gold populations
It is not Israel who pays it is the
is Europe and C therefore sets out
stop what will happen
normally it is up to Israel to pay
Obviously Israel will not want to pay
for some of other actors should
intervene like the Arab countries which
have the means and which give less than
Westerners at the rescue office and
of the United Nations for
Palestine refugees to the nearby
East
