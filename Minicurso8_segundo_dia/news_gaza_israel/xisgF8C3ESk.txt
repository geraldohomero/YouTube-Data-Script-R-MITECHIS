AUDIENCE.
THE VICTIMS INCLUDE A 33-YEAR-
OLD AMERICAN CANADIAN CITIZEN.
>> PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CALLED
THE CHEF TO SAY HE WAS
HEARTBROKEN OVER THE ATTACK AND
AID WORKERS MUST BE PROTECTED.
WHAT ELSE DO WE HEAR FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THIS ?
>> YOU TOOK THE WORDS FROM
KIRBY.
THE PRESIDENT WAS OUTRAGED AND
THERE WAS A STATEMENT RELEASED
SAYING AS MUCH.
IT IS THE IMPACT ON
HUMANITARIAN AID WORKERS, 200
AID WORKERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN
GAZA SINCE THE START OF THIS
WAR.
NOW SIX MONTHS IN.
THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY WANT TO
SEE AN INVESTIGATION. IT HAS TO
BE SWIFT AND BRING
ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE FINDINGS
MUST BE PUBLIC.
MUST BE PUBLIC.
THEN THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE
AID WORKERS.
LET ME READ IT TO YOU.
IT IS SHARPER IN TONE THAN WHAT
WE HAVE HEARD.
ISRAEL HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH TO
PROTECT AID WORKERS.
INCIDENTS LIKE YESTERDAY'S
SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.
THEY HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH TO
PROTECT CIVILIANS. THE
PRESIDENT COMMUNICATING HIS
DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE
SITUATION TAKING PLACE THERE.
THERE IS AN AMERICAN TEAM IN
CAIRO AND WORKING ON AN
IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE.
TO THIS POINT, THEY HAVE BEEN
RELUCTANT TO CALL FOR A
PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE BECAUSE IT
IS A TOP PRIORITY TO SUPPORT
THEIR RIGHT TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES AND GETTING THE
HOSTAGES, INCLUDING AMERICANS,
HOME.
>> DO THEY PLAN TO HOLD THEM
ACCOUNTABLE SPECIFICALLY.
YOU MENTIONED 200 OR MORE
GROUPS OR WORKERS. DOES THIS
AIRSTRIKE -- IS IT DIFFERENT?
WILL SOMETHING COME OF IT?
>> THERE DIFFERENT THINGS.
THERE IS A LOUD MEGAPHONE.
HE IS AN INTERNATIONAL FIGURE
IN THIS IS GOD'S ATTENTION.
IT WILL MAINTAIN A LOT OF FOCUS
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
HE WILL SAY THINGS PUBLICLY AND
PERHAPS IN AN INTERVIEW.
AS IT RELATES TO OUR POSITION,
THEY ARE NOT CALLING FOR HIS
PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE.
A LOT OF THE FOCUS BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES AND ISRAELI
OFFICIALS IS ON WHAT HAPPENS
NEXT IN THE CITY, SOUTHERN
BORDER CITIES HAVE 1 MILLION
PALESTINIANS CRAMMED IN THERE
WITH DESPERATE CONDITIONS.
THE U.S. HAS MADE CLEAR THAT
THE ISRAELIS DESIRE TO GO IN
THE ISRAELIS DESIRE TO GO IN
THERE AND ANYWAY WOULD BE
UNACCEPTABLE.
THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO PUSH
FORWARD.
YOU CAN KEEP AN EYE ON THE
GROWING PRESSURE FOR CONDITION
TO BE PLACED ON THE ISRAELIS AS
