IT'S HARDER TO DENY THE
OPTICS.
THE AMERICAN EVACUATION IN
KABUL VERSUS THE ONE IN 1975,
THE FALL OF SAIGON.
SO AFTER BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
SPENT, 158 CANADIAN LIVES
LOST AND SCORES OF SOLDIERS
STILL BEARING THE SCARS,
AFGHANISTAN IS BACK TO WHERE
IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO.
AND AFGHAN ALLIES, WHO
ASSISTED THE CANADIAN
MISSION,
IF THEY CAN'T GET TO THE
AIRPORT, THEY'VE GONE
UNDERGROUND.
>> WE CAN HEAR GUNSHOTS AND
FIRING.
MOST OF THE PLACES IS TAKEN
BY TALIBAN AND MOST OF
CHECKPOINTS EVERYWHERE.
>> Sandie: AND THEY'RE
RUNNING OUT OF PLACES TO
HIDE.
CTV'S MELANIE NAGY HAS THAT
STORY.
>> DANGER FOR US.
I NEED HELP, PLEASE.
HELP.
>> Reporter: AN URGENT CALL
FROM KABUL.
YOU'RE IN HIDING RIGHT NOW.
>> RIGHT NOW I AM HIDING IN
MY HOME WITH MY FAMILY, WITH
MY TWO CHILDREN.
>> Reporter: ON THE LINE IS
A MAN NAMED OBAYIR.
>> I NEED HELP.
EMERGENCY HELP FROM CANADA,
FROM CANADA'S GOVERNMENT.
>> Reporter: HE SAYS HE
SERVED MORE THAN A YEAR AS
AN INTERPRETER FOR THE
CANADIAN ARMED FORCES.
WITH THE TALIBAN NOW IN HIS
HOME CITY, HE FEARS FOR HIS
LIFE AND THAT OF HIS FAMILY,
ALL BECAUSE HE HELPED
CANADA'S MISSION IN
AFGHANISTAN.
>> I FEAR FOR YOU THAT THEY
WILL KILL MY FAMILY MEMBERS
OR THEY WILL KILL ME.
>> Reporter: THERE ARE 1,000
INTERPRETERS AND FAMILIES IN
KABUL.
MANY TODAY RUSHED TO THE
AIRPORT,
TO THE AREA WHERE MILITARY
PLANES TYPICALLY PARK IN A
DESPERATE BID TO ESCAPE.
>> PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE
THE INNER GATES TO THE
KARZAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT,
WITH NO CLEAR PLAN ON WHAT
TO DO.
>> Reporter: GETTING
CLARIFICATION NOW
COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT
CANADA HAS CLOSED THE
EMBASSY.
WHEN ASKED TODAY HOW EXACTLY
HE'LL EVACUATE CANADIAN
ALLIES STILL IN THE CAPITAL,
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS SHORT
ON DETAILS.
>> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau:
WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO
PROCESS PEOPLE SEEKING TO
FLEE AFGHANISTAN.
>> Reporter: SYED SHAH WANTS
ANSWERS.
THE AFGHAN INTERPRETER NOW
LIVES IN TORONTO.
BUT HIS YOUNGER BROTHERS,
ONE OF WHICH HE SAYS WORKED
FOR CANADA, ARE IN KABUL.
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO
DO.
>> Reporter: ON FRIDAY
OTTAWA ANNOUNCED IT'S
ACCEPTING UP TO 20,000
AFGHAN REFUGEES BUT NO TIME
LINE WAS GIVEN.
AND THAT WORRIES SHAH.
>> WE HOPE THAT THEY ARE
COMING SO WE TOLD THEM TO
