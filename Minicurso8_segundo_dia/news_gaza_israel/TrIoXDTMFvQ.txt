How did you live the day they started
The bombings and well every day
later as the day they started
The bombings woke me up eh
It was really terrible, I have a lot of anxiety
a lot of despair
eh especially at night when I saw
that the sky illuminated and then that
Glass trembled by the impact of
Missiles exploited in the air do not eh the
truth is a quite strong feeling
I had never lived and I hope
it will never come back
repeat it how the return process was
To Colombia and what are your sensations
Today once you are in your country
Well, I initially in my networks
social I made a video and then I asked
my friends to label me and what
label the
Eh Foreign Ministry of Colombia and then
Some of them for their relationships
They wrote to the Foreign Ministry and
Also in fabric I was in
Fabric I wrote to the consulate they
They answered and then
eh practically the next day already
I was ready and two days after
We could return that is yesterday
We return today in the early morning
We return Roberto once I was
would like to ask you as last
Ask when you were there in Israel and
I was of course on the first day
that we fit when you counted us
When the bombings and all began
This situation that you were eh
counting what else you could detail
What you lived in in those days huh how
people behaved in the place where
You were what the feeling was
GENERAL Well, I was in cloth
In in the Jerusalem Beach sector and
well
eh practically the city was alone
There was no one on the beach nobody
I went running to jog
The only thing that was open were the
stores the supermarkets of the rest
trade restaurants absolutely everything
closed and a feeling of solitude h and
In fact I as a foreigner for my color
of skin because I was also afraid of
Exit I don't know, maybe someone comes
And then attentive to and then really
handles a lot of anxiety because huh you don't know
Eh how to handle this type of
No pressures and
because apart from that huh that you are in a
moment thinking about something and suddenly
The explosion sounds and how again
It reminds you that you are at war that
You are at war and above all that you are
tied in the country because airlines
Well, they canceled flight and effectively
many Colombians and many people who
We were beyond another because we stayed
trapped in the country
