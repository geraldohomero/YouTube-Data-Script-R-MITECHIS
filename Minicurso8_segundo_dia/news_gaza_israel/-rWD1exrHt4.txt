STUART: THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT
CHIEFS, GENERAL CHARLES BROWN,
GAVE A STERN WARNING TO IRAN.
HE'S TELLING THEM, DO NOT GET
INVOLVED IN THE WAR.
FORMER PENTAGON OFFICIAL BRETT
SADLER IS WITH ME NOW.
IN YOUR JUDGMENT, ARE WE CLOSE
TO WAR WITH IRAN?
>> I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS,
NO, UNLESS IRAN ACTUALLY TAKES A
PROVOCATIVE ACTION AND CROSSES A
RED E LINE LIKE ATTACKING U.S.
FORCES IN THE PERSIAN GULF.
STUART: WELL, IN THE PAST
PRESIDENT TRUMP LAID DOWN A RED
LINE WITH IRAN.
THEY CROSSED IT, AND HE HE
KNOCKED OFF THEIR TERROR LEADER.
I MEAN, THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE
RESPONSE.
WHAT RED LINES HAVE WE LAID DOWN
WITH IRAN NOW UNDER PRESIDENT
BIDEN?
>> WELL, I THINK THE KILLING OF
SOLEIMANI IS AN INTERESTING AND
SEPARATE CASE.
THAT WAS THE GENTLEMAN THAT HAD
LED TERROR OPERATIONS AND PROXY
WARS THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST
AND KILLED MANY HUNDREDS OF
AMERICANS THROUGHOUT OUR
INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ.
AND SO HIS DAY WAS COMING, AND
TRUMP THANKFULLY TACK THAT, AND
IT SENT -- TOOK THAT, AND IT
SENT A VERY CLEAR SIGNAL TO
TEHRAN THAT THE UNITED STATES
WASN'T GOING TO TOLERATE IT.
WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR AND SEND A
SIMILAR SIGNAL AGAIN NOW IF WE
START TO HEAR OR FIND OUT THAT
HEZBOLLAH OR HAMAS ARE PLANNING
RETALIATORY ACTIONS OR ACTIONS
AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD.
ALREADY IN GAZA THEY'VE KILLED
OVER 20 AMERICAN CITIZENS, SO
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE U.S.
TAKE RETALIATORY ACTIONS AGAINST
A HAMAS SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE
ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICANS.
STUART: BUT WILL PRESIDENT BIDEN
SHOW THAT KIND OF STRENGTH TO GO
AFTER IRAN IF THEY CROSS ONE OF
THESE RED LINES?
WILL WE DO IT?
>> WELL, THE TRACK RECORD'S NOT
VERY GOOD IN THAT REGARD.
ONE, WE'RE CONTINUALLY GETTING
REPORTS THAT MEMBERS OF HIS
ADMINISTRATION ARE VERY
FAVORABLE THIS LEANING TOWARDS
IRAN'S INTERESTS AND NOT U.S.
INTERESTS.
WE'RE ALSO CONTINUE CANALLY
BEING REMINDED OF HIS INABILITY
TO TAKE STRONG ACTION OR TO
SIGNAL COMMITMENTS.
IT GOT US INTO, IT GAVE RUSSIA A
GREEN LIGHT TO INVADE IN
FEBRUARY OF '22 UKRAINE.
AND IT ALL STARTS WITH THE
DISASTROUS WITHDRAWAL FROM
AFGHANISTAN.
IT SIGNALED THE U.S. DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT ITS ALLIES OR ITS OWN
CITIZENS WHEN THEY WERE UNDER
DIRECT THREAT DISCOVER SEAS.
SO THE TRACK RECORD'S NOT CLEAR.
STUART: OKAY, BRENT, WE HAVE T
