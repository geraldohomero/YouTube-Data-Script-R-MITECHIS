that early Dromi joins us live from
Jerusalem he was spokesperson for former
Israeli Prime Minister's it's aqua beam
and Shimon Peres thanks ever so much for
joining us Netanyahu's sending a clear
message to the UN security council
members isn't he
yes I accept that
I here in Israel we have mixed feelings
about this resolution and especially
about the UN position because what to
okay mr. Obama so long to do that if he
really felt a bit way to do it just
before mr. Trump is taking over who
already said he's going to have a
different policy is really confusing us
and in the meantime our prime minister
is summoning ambassador etc but this
causes a lot of confusion here
you talk about a lot of confusion so it
is a really inflammatory issue these
settlements and what what could happen
next where do you see it going well
depends if Prime Minister Netanyahu
succumbs to the pressures of the far
right in his government because they are
already calls to a next at least part of
the areas which will only cause more
condemnation in the world so I hope that
once after a week or two when
the dust settles mmm we'll go back to a
very are cautioned cautious policy
because there is no point in really
rubbing in the in the face of the world
right now
you talk about this condemnation in the
world but a couple of months ago
Netanyahu predicted that the tone was
changing that anti-israel sentiment was
going to change is it well
we need to make a reality check to
decide it some of us believe that his
rhetoric are a bit
distance from ray from the from his
accomplishments so
and some of us doubt if he's
going to Congress against the world of
mr. Obama was right move or if a
regulation law which tried to bypass the
laws of the country about the
territory or a
land property
was the right thing to do so
there's a lot of rhetoric from the Prime
Minister right now not much
success I i I'm afraid
okay well you redraw me thank you ever
so much for your insight there
