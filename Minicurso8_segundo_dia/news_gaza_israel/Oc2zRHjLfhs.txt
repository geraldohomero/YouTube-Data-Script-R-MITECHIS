TOM:
PAUL, WHERE DO WE STAND IN TERMS OF THESE CEASE-FIRE TALKS?
RAMADAN HAS STARTED.
HOW DANGEROUS IS THIS MOMENT?
>> THERE WERE HIGH HOPES AS
CEASE-FIRE WOULD BE IN PLACE
FOR THE START OF RAMADAN.
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED.
TALKS ARE CONTINUING, NOT ON A
FORMAL IN PERSON CAPACITY.
THERE WERE NEGOTIATORS FROM THE
MEDIATORS AND HAMAS IN CAIRO,
BUT THEY HAVE LEFT.
THERE IS A CHANCE WE COULD GET
AS CEASE-FIRE SOMETIME DURING
THIS MONTH.
THERE IS NO INEVITABILITY, BUT
I THINK IT IS SOMETHING ISRAEL
IS PREPARED TO ACCEPT IF IT IS
ALONG THE BROAD LINES THAT HAVE
BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY, WHICH
IS ROUGHLY A SIX WEEK TRUCE IN
EXCHANGE FOR 40 HOSTAGES STILL
HELD BY HAMAS ARE BEING
RELEASED FROM GAZA. TOM:
WHAT I HEAR THE U.S.
PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT RED
LINES IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT
RED LINES ARTICULATED BY FORMER
US
PRESIDENTS IN SYRIA, BUT WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT A HISTORIC ALLY.
HOW BAD ARE TENSIONS BETWEEN
BIDEN AND NETANYAHU FOR BIDEN
TO BE USING THIS LANGUAGE?
>> THOSE TENSIONS ARE GROWING
AND GROWING PRETTY RAPIDLY, AND
UNTIL NOW BIDEN AND THE U.S.
HAVE NOT TOTALLY RULED OUT
ISRAEL ATTACKING RAFAH.
THEY SAID IT CANNOT HAPPEN
UNDER THE CURRENT
CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH MEANS THE
ONE MILLION PLUS CIVILIANS THAT
FLED TO RAFAH HAD TO BE ALLOWED
OUT FIRST, AND ISRAEL PLEDGE
THAT WOULD HAPPEN, THAT THEY
WOULD OPEN A SAFE CORRIDOR TO
ENABLE THEM TO LEAVE BEFORE AN
ASSAULT ON THE CITY, WHICH IS
THOUGHT TO HOLD 5000 TO 8000
HAMAS FIGHTERS BUT YESTERDAY IT
SEEMED TO BE ROLLED OUT
ALTOGETHER.
I THINK AT THAT IS A HARDENING
OF THE US STANCE. THE US
NOW BELIEVES ISRAEL SHOULD NOT
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ATTACK
ROUGH -- RAFAH.
THE OTHER QUESTION IS WHAT
LEVERAGE DOES THE US
HAVE TO STOP AN ATTACK ON RAFAH
IF ISRAEL PUSHES AHEAD WITH ITS
PLAN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD
SAY IT HAS VERY LITTLE.
THERE IS NOTHING BIDEN AND THE
US CAN DO TO STOP IT.
