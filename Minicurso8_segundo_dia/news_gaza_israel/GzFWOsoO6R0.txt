Israeli forces waiting for political order
To attack the gaz and when
This march will start something towards Gaja then
Can not be done until political
Order does not get another on my left side
Big ground cameraman value will show you
How to have hundreds of tanks as well as
Infantry career vehicles you have
Soldiers here too
Will be seen which are fully prepared
And deployed but until Benjamin
Order from the government from Netanyahu
Can't find it to go towards the gaz
Till they will not move forward, there is a clear message that
Not only preparation is not only deployed
Rather too much readiness here
Visited with infect tanks
In my cameraman, you are that one
Trench of small soil
He is also made, he will show a lot
It is important that even though hundreds of tanks
Here are there but any on these tanks
There is no kind of attack at this location
There is no kind of attack, that's why this way
Many five seven soldiers to you this whole ground
Shown even providing security to
If you give it, it is obvious that Israel
Israeli Defense Forces still on land
It seems that such attacks can happen and
Some Hamas terrorists still land in Israel
But that's why protection should be provided in this way
Till then these tanks and heavy
Machinery is ahead of Israeli Defense Forces
Until a political order will increase
This order is not received from the government
Because the deployment and preparation of ABP
News to you continuously for the last five days
It is showing but it is very complicated
There will be a decision when to move forward
Because when you move forward in large numbers
With hundreds of tanks and infantry
Obviously with career vehicles
It is a matter that you also have a collet damage and
The chances of loss are very high
And that's why after all calculations
Diplomatic Political on Ground in
Situation guns situation to all this
Completely understanding and calculations
Later, this forces will be well
Will order them from the government
I will get blessings with the cameraman value
