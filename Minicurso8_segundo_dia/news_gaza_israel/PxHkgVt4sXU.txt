with respect to my
conversations with uh Minister Jai
Shanker uh we reviewed uh uh the General

System the state of
multilateralism uh the fact that
multilateralism had come under
increasing
pressure
um uh the

Gaza to a lesser degree in
Ukraine uh the political situation in
Haiti which remains a matter of
concern uh given haes descent into law
into
lawlessness uh
uh over the last 2 or 3 years in

terrorism but it did it was mentioned in
the
conversation uh in the context of uh
promoting International Peace and

meeting very
engaging um and I look forward to
continuing and deepening the relations
between the general assembly and the
