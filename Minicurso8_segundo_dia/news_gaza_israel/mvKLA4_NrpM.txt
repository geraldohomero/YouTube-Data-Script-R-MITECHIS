 
LARGER PORTION OF PALESTINIAN 
PRISONERS, IF THAT'S WHAT IT 
TAKES TO GET THE REST OF THESE 
HOSTAGES HOME. 
>>> MORE THAN 200 PALESTINIAN 
PRISONERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN 
EXCHANGE FOR IS REALLY HOSTAGES 
HELD BY HAMAS. 
AND THESE SWAPS HAVE 
HIGHLIGHTED THE CASE OF 
PALESTINIANS HELD IN ISRAELI 
PRISONS. 
ISRAELI PRISONS ARE CURRENTLY 
HOUSING AT LEAST 7000 
PALESTINIANS ACCORDING TO A 
PALESTINIAN PRISONER RIGHTS 
GROUP. 
MORE THAN 2000 OF THOSE 
DETAINEES ARE BEING HELD UNDER 
A POLICY CALLED ADMINISTRATIVE 
DETENTION. 
THAT ALLOWS ISRAELI AUTHORITIES 
TO INCARCERATE PALESTINIANS 
WITHOUT CHARGE OR TRIAL. 
THESE HOLDS CAN BE RENEWED 
INDEFINITELY, SOME INDIVIDUALS 
HAVE BEEN HELD FOR YEARS 
WITHOUT BEING CHARGE BUT MOST 
OF THE PEOPLE BEING RELEASED OR 
IMPRISONED FOR A SHORTER AMOUNT

DETENTION. 
PALESTINIANS UNDER THE AGE OF 
18 ARE NOT EXEMPT, AND THE LIST 
OF PRISONERS SLATED FOR 
POSSIBLE RELEASE INCLUDES AT 
LEAST 124 TEENAGERS. 
AN AVERAGE OF 500 TO 700 MINORS 
ARE HELD IN MILITARY DETENTION. 
ISRAEL IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW 
COUNTRIES THAT PROSECUTES 
MINORS IN MILITARY COURTS. 
THE MOST COMMON CHARGE FOR 
PALESTINIANS UNDER 18 IS 
STONETHROWING WHICH COULD CARRY 
UP TO A 20 YEAR PRISON 
SENTENCE. 
STONETHROWING IS ALSO ONE OF 
THE MOST PROMINENT CHARGES 
FILED AGAINST THE 300 PRISONERS 
THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR 
RELEASE DURING THE HOSTAGE 
SWAP. 
OTHER MORE SERIOUS CRIMES FILED 
AGAINST THE PRISONERS INCLUDE 
THREATENING SECURITY, ILLEGALLY 
ENTERING ISRAEL AND SUPPORTING 
TERRORISM. 
SEVERAL WERE ALSO CHARGED WITH 
TTEMPTED MURDER FOR ATTACKS ON 
ISRAELI FORCES. 
AND IN RESPONSE TO CRITICISM 
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE 
DETENTION POLICY, ISRAEL HAS
