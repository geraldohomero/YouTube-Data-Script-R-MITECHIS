Thus Biden yesterday wanted to breastfeed that
4 -hour Israeli breaks are already
above the table and that are the result
of American diplomacy has said
Biden Israeli breaks is 4 hours
They are already reality and has said biden ha
said the White House are the result of
Diplomacy
American in a clear environment in the
that you begin to see how the United States
You also want to deflate photography
that he goes in the Middle East what he has
surprised this morning from
Netanyahu Netanyahu has said that the
according to Saudi Arabia with whom
Saudi Arabia and they have broken relationships
diplomatic is still possible and has
said Netan Yahu after a victory
against you have every time I say
this
Netanyahu you have to put an annex not
A GLOSE DO NOT GLOSAR MAN GET
The victory against ever when over
All its leaders are in Qatar
seems
complicated after a victory
against it would never be more feasible for such
so that Netanyahu is saying or
is tensioning that relationship between Iran
and Saudi Arabia marking a path
Intentified by intentional Netanahu
By Israel in which he is putting
above the world
Arab that with whom he will be able to reach
historical agreements is precisely
Saudi Arabia
And in this environment we see the photograph of
Cor the DMU this shows us that
Nor will they go and Saudi Arabia despite
The diplomatic rupture of Saudi Arabia
Israel are so
Eh close as expected precisely
Alejania makes him help
Close the hormuz strait but
After a victory it will be more
feasible Netanyahu said the relationship
A historical agreement with Saudi Arabia
especially to link the economic
Saudi Arabia oil and that gas where
Great deposits have been found
where in Gaza and where that exit to
Mediterranean can be a point
Neuralgic business for Israel but
also for Saudi Arabia arriving at
Europe taking advantage of the space eh that the
sanctions have left after
Sanctions to Russia in such a way that
We have a clear photograph in which
The economic reappears in what
geopolitical as a fundamental element
hidden
