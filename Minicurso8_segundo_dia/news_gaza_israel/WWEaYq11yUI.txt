I got it.

Emphasize and draw a line.
I'm a correspondent in Washington.
The US State Department
Although it is being reported closely,
He said he did not have information.
It's still too early to reveal the cause of the explosion
I did.
At the same time, the cause of the explosion and the United States are related.
Regarding the suspicion that it was a clear line, I drew a clear line.
I talked about some irresponsible arguments I saw

Something will happen before and after the commander's memorial service
Signs were not recognized in advance
Added.
Some kind of violence before and after the Solaymani memorial service
There is no sign that the situation will happen.
I couldn't.

It is a retaliation and is attacking private ships in the Red Sea
For the Yemen Huti rebels, 12 countries, including the United States,

I made a statement.
Even many other countries that have not participated in the statement
