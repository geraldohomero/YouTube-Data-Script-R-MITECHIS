RAFAH.
TODAY NETANYAHU SAID NO FORCE IN
THE WORLD WILL STOP US
JOINING ME NOW FROM TEL AVIV I
OUR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEIN
HERE
WHAT ARE THE REMAINING OBSTACLES
IN THE PEACE TALKS
HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT THE TW
SIDES WILL WORK THROUGH THEM
>> Reporter: WELL, YOU MENTIONED
ONE OF THEM AND WE SPOKE TO ON
OF OUR SOURCES CLOSE TO PRIM
MINISTER'S OFFICE, BRIEFED O
THE WAR CABINET AND WHAT THE
SAID IS THE RETURN O
PALESTINIANS TOTHE NORTH IS ON
OF THE STICKING POINTS THAT
HAMAS REPRESENTATIVE WOULD HAV
WANTED, A COMPLETELY LIMITLESS
OF ALL OF THE PAL STINNIANS TO
THE GAZA STRIP
AND ISRAELIS WANTED A LIMITE
NUMBER TO RETURN WITH STRICT
SECURITY CHECKS.
AND THERE ARE MANY MOR
DISAGREEMENTS, NAMELY HOW LONG
THE CEASE FIRE WOULD LAST, AND
HOW MANY HOSTAGES CAN AND WOUL
BE RELEASED.
THE TWO SIDES APPEAR TO BE FAR
APART.
WE ARE HEARING CONFLICTING
REPORTS.
OVER THE WEEKEND, THERE WERE
SOME OF THE PARTICIPANTS FLOATED
BY EGYPTIAN MEDIA, QUOTED AS
SAYING WE HAD MADE MORE PROGRESS
THIS TIME AROUND THAN IN
PREVIOUS ROUNDS.
IT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF HAMA
WE UNDER
AND WE ARE WAITING FOR THEIR
UNDERSTAND TO THE PROPOSAL THA
WAS PUT FORTH IN CAIRO
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE WILL KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON
>> AS YOU KEEP A CLOSE EYE O
THAT, WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT
ISRAEL'S PLANS FOR RAFAH AND
WHETHER THEY HAVE A MRN TO
PROTECT THE MILLIONS O
CIVILIANS THAT ARE SHELTERIN
THERE?
>> Reporter: SO, WE DO KNOW THAT
RHETORICALLY, AT LEAST, TH
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU, THE DEFENSE MINISTER,
ARE STILL VERY MUCH VOWING TO GO
AHEAD WITH THE RAFAH OFFENSIVE
THAT BIDEN HAS SAID PUBLICLY I
NOT A GOOD IDEA.
HOWEVER, WITH THE RETREAT OF
STROOPZ IN THE SOUTH OVER TH
WEEKEND AND THE FACT THAT TH
CEASE FIRE NEGOTIATIONS AR
STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE,
HOPEFULLY, AND THAT ANY CEAS
FIRE OF COURSE WOULD DELAY A
FULL SCALE GROUND OFFENSIVE IN
RAFAH DOESN'T SEEM AS THOUGH
ANYTHING IS IMMINENT
OF CIVILIANS, PALESTINIANS WIL
TELL YOU THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT WIL
PROTECT CIVILIANS.
THEY WILL POINT TO HOW THEY HAVE
BEEN TREATED IN THE GAZA STRIP
TO HOW THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO GO
TO SAFE ZONES THAT WER
SUBSEQUENTLY BOMBED.
SO THEREFORE, THERE IS ZER
TRUST ON THE PALESTINIAN SIDE.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT, THAT TH
