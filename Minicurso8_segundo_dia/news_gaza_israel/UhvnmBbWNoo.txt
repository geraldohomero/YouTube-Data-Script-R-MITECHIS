times of
War both women and men are required to
serve for at least 24 to 32 months there
are however a few exceptions including
religious women married individuals and
those deemed mentally and medically
unfit we have mobilized more than
300,000 Reserve troops which to put into
context is more than we have ever done
before in such a short period of
time a father here promises his son he
will be back soon as the war rages the
human cost is
unprecedented innocent civilians from
both Israel and Gaza are the worst
hit the UN Chief has called for a
two-state agreement between the two
sides but given the situation on the
ground it seems like a pip dream for now
till such time young adults 20y olds
