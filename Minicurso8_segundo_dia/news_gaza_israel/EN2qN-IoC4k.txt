>> John: TREY YINGST IN THE 
SOUTHERN PART OF ISRAEL AS THE 
ACTION CONTINUES.
THANK YOU.
>> Sandra: WILDFIRES STARTED BY 
GUNFIRE BREAKING OUT IN SOUTHERN
LEBANON AS CLASHES BETWEEN THE 
IDF AND HEZBOLLAH INTENSIFY.
IT COMES AS IRANIAN TERROR 
PROXIES ESCALATE THREATS AGAINST
THE U.S. AND ALLIES IN THE 
REGION.
GREG PALKOT IS LIVE IN NORTHERN 
ISRAEL.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US AT THIS 
HOUR?
>> THE LATEST WE HEARD WERE 
SMALL ARMS FIRE, NOT TOO FAR 
AWAY FROM US, WE ARE AGAINST THE
ISRAEL-LEBANON BORDER.
ESCALATING, AND THE LAST 24 
HOURS, FOUR HEZBOLLAH ROCKETS 
WERE FIRED NOT FAR FROM US, GOT 
TEN RETURN BLASTS FROM NEARBY 
ISRAELI ARTILLERY.
BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN KEEPING THE
SCRIMMAGES BASICALLY NEAR THE 
BORDER, BUT THERE ARE REPORTS OF
ISRAEL LAUNCHING FIGHTER JET AND
DRONE STRIKES DEEPER INTO 
LEBANON AS THE TOLL GROWS.
46 HEZBOLLAH FIGHTERS KILLED IN 
THE LAST TWO WEEKS, AT LEAST SIX
ISRAELI SOLDIERS ALONG WITH 
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.
A VERY TELLING PICTURE JUST 
RELEASED, A MEETING IN BEIRUT, 
LEBANON, BETWEEN A TOP HAMAS 
OFFICIAL, LEADER OF ANOTHER 
MILITANT GROUP AND THE HEAD OF 
HEZBOLLAH.
BEHIND THEM, PICTURES OF PAST 
AND PRESENT LEADERS, AND 
BENEFACTOR, IRAN.
BENNY GANTZ IN THE ISRAEL WAR 
CABINET SAID ABOUT THE FIGHT 
WITH HEZBOLLAH.
>> THE IDF HAVE A THICK AND VERY
STRONG SHIELD ALONG THE ENTIRE 
NORTHERN BORDER ON ALL ITS 
FRONTS.
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CASUALTIES
TO HEZBOLLAH.
I SUGGEST TO OUR ENEMY NOT TO 
GET CONFUSED.
OUR POWER IS TREMENDOUS, READY 
TO LAUNCH AND THEY BETTER 
BEWARE.
>> AGAIN, SANDRA, IT'S NOT A 
FULL SCALE WAR BUT THE 
SCRIMMAGES ARE DEADLY AND TYING 
UP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ISRAELI 
SOLDIERS IN THIS REGION, AND 
FORCING NOW ESTIMATED ABOUT 
200,000 CIVILIANS TO FLEE ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER.
TROUBLE BREWING.
