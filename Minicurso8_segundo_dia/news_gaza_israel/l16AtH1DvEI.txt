FRANCIS.
CHIEF INTERNATIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT PAUL WORKMAN IS 
SPANNING BY IN ROME WITH MORE.
HELLO TO YOU.
WHAT IS THE SCENE WHERE YOU ARE 
THIS MORNING?  
>> Reporter:  GOOD MORNING.
WELL, A STEADY LINE OF PEOPLE 
GOING IN AND OUT OF THE 
BASILICA, ST. PETERS, BEHIND ME 
HERE.
AS YOU SAID ABOUT 65,000 PEOPLE 
PASSED IN TORONTO OF THE BODY 
YESTERDAY.
PROBABLY THEY WILL HAVE A 
SIMILAR NUMBER TODAY.
IT DOES SEEM TO BE MORE THAN THE
VATICAN EXPECTED.
IT IS REALLY MATTER OF FACT 
HERE.
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF EMOTION 
ATTACHED TO THIS.
OF COURSE, POPE BENEDICT WAS IN 
RETIREMENT FOR A DECADE.
HE DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT PRETTY 
MUCH FOR MOST CATHOLICS SO THOSE
WHO HAVE COME HERE TODAY, ARE 
PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS POPE OR 
THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE HERE AS 
TOURISTS AND ARE TAKING THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE -- TO TAKE 
PART IN THE DEATH OF A POPE FOR 
THAT PARTICULAR REASON, WHETHER 
IT IS SPIRITUAL OR HISTORIC.
THE VIEWING GOES ON FOR QUITE A 
NUMBER OF HOURS.  
OVER AT ABOUT 7:00 IN THE 
EVENING.  
THERE WILL BE BE ANOTHER DAY 
TOMORROW BEFORE THURSDAY ICE 
FUNERAL.
AS I SAID QUITE MATTER OF FACT 
BECAUSE THIS POPE BEN TICKET 
DIDN'T TOUCH PEOPLE IN THE SAME 
WAY THAT JOHN PAUL II DID OR 
POPE FRANCIS NOW DID.
BOTH VERY CHARISMATIC FOLKS.
BENEDICT WAS KNOWN AS A GREAT 
THEOLOGIAN.
THE GREATEST THING ABOUT HIS 
PAPACY IS HE RETIRED A DECADE 
AGO.
HAVING TWO HOPES INSIDE THE 
VATICAN AT THE SAME TIME.
>> Marcia: RIGHT.
NOW WE HAVE POPE BENEDICT WHO 
WILL BE REMEMBERED BY ANOTHER 
POPE ON THURSDAY.
TELL US MORE ABOUT THE FUNERAL 
PREPARATIONS AND WHAT WE CAN BE 
EXPECT.
>> THAT IS RIGHT.
POPE FRANCIS WILL LEAD MASS FOR 
THE PERSON HE SUCCEEDEDED WHICH 
IS QUITE FASCINATING AGAIN.
IT WILL BE A TYPICAL HIGH MASS 
OF THE BODY WILL BE BROUGHT OUT 
OF ST. PETER'S.
PROBABLY WITH THE CEREMONY SOME 
TIME AROUND 9:00 IN THE MORNING 
ON THURSDAY.
POPE BENEDICT ASKEDED TO HAVE A 
SIMPLE AND SOMBRE FUNERAL.
IT IS PRETTY HARD TO DO THAT 
WHEN THE SETTING IS THE MAJESTY,
MAJESTIC ST. PETER'S BASILICA.
IT WILL BE AN HOUR.
THERE BE OFFICIAL DELEGATIONSES 
FROM GERMANY WHERE POPE BENEDICT
CAME FROM AND ITALY AS THE HOST 
COUNTRY OF THE VET VATICAN 
ITSELF.
