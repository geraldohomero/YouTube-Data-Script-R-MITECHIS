in the words of the United Nations the
Gaza Strip has now become a hell
hole yet the only way to send in
humanitarian Aid is
shut 100 trucks packed with desperately
needed supplies waiting at the Rafa
Crossing in Egypt where they've been
stuck for days and it was here that the
UN Secretary General decided to ditch
the diplomacy
from a Podium erected in front of the
gate Behind These
Walls we have 2 million
people that is suffering
enormously that has no water no food no
medicine no fool moderation replaced
with exasperation here as the Egyptians
and Israelis disagree on the number and
content of Aid shipments these trucks
are not just
trucks they are a
Lifeline they are the difference between
life and death for so many people in
Gaza International Aid agencies have
become increasingly alarmed and their
language increasingly strident un
experts calling Israel Siege and
bombardment unspeakably cruel in Gaza
City the blast from an Israeli air
strike destroyed the hall and Scout
Center at an Orthodox Church the
Christian Community had been using them
as
shelters put your hand under Salim said
one as parishioners tried to extract
their friends and loved ones from the
rubble this man had lost his
life God has deserted us said
some
some like this father of
three look at this child do you think he
deserve to die said Aram
manuri he showed our team pictures of
his children Maji Julie and swella all
three died in the
blast this is a crime it's a crime
against humanity this F-16 airplane
through these things knowing there were
people down there they did it with
hatred no one in Gaza feels safe but
being in the church gave us the feeling
that we were close to
God Israel says it doesn't Target
civilians as it seeks to destroy
Hamas but that means little to the
congregation of St pierus now living
their own kind of hell John Sparks Sky
