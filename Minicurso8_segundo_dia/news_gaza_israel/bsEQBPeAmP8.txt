>> Ainsley: FOX NEWS ALERT.
FIRES ARE BURNING IN THE WEST 
BANK AS MAJOR PROTEST ERUPTING 
IN THAT AREA.
>> Brian: JONATHAN HUNT IS LIVE 
IN THAT AREA.
>> Jonathan: PROTESTERS ON THEIR
WAY HERE.
WE ARE IN THE CENTER OF 
RAMALLAH.
THEY ARE MOVING TO THE EDGE OF 
RAMALLAH.
WE CAN SHOW YOU THAT THE INITIAL
PROTESTS HAVE SET FIRES DOWN IN 
FRONT OF US THERE.
THOSE ARE TIRES, WHICH IS ONE 
THING THEY FREQUENTLY DO TO SEND
SMOKE UP.
LOOK FURTHER TO THE RIGHT THERE,
THOSE BUILDINGS IN FRONT OF US, 
THAT IS IDF HEADQUARTERS HERE.
RIGHT BEHIND THAT, IN FACT, IS 
ONE OF THE JEWISH SETTLEMENTS 
THAT SIT ON THE EDGE OF 
RAMALLAH.
WHAT WE EXPECT THE HUNDREDS OF 
PROTESTERS TO DO, COME DOWN TO 
WHERE YOU ARE SEEING THE FIRES 
BURNING AND TRADITIONALLY THEY 
GATHER IN FRONT OF US AND BEGIN 
THROWING STONES TOWARD ANY 
SOLDIERS COMING FROM THE BASE OR
OUTSIDE THE BASE.
PASSIONS RUN HIGH HERE AFTER 
FRIDAY, BUT IN THE WAKE OF WHAT 
HAPPENED SINCE OCTOBER 7, 
PALESTINIANS WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
ARE FURIOUS.
IF YOU PUT TO THEM THE BARRITY 
AND HORRIFIC NATURE OF THE 
ATTACK OF OCTOBER 7 OF HAMAS, 
THEY SAY, CIVILIANS SHOULD NOT 
HAVE BEEN KILLED BUT BELIEVE 
HAMAS'S FIGHT IS JUSTIFIED.
WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO 
POLITICALLY CONNECTED PEOPLE 
THAT SAY PALESTINIANS ARE 
RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE WITH THE
PALESTINIAN THAT GOVERNS IN 
RAMALLAH AND THE WEST BANK.
IF THERE WAS AN ELECTION HELD 
NOW THEY BELIEVE THAT HAMAS 
WOULD WIN IT.
JUST IMAGINE HOW FRIGHTEN A 
PROSPECT THAT IS FOR ANYONE IN 
ISRAEL.
WE'RE BEING TOLD BY PEOPLE THAT 
KNOW THE SITUATION THAT ISLAMIC 
JIHAD IS GAINING STRENGTH, TOO, 
IN THE FURTHER PART OF THE WEST 
BANK AROUND CITIES LIKE JANINE.
LAST NIGHT NINE PALESTINIANS 
WERE KILLED IN ISSUE CLAS WITH 
THE IDF.
THAT IS HERE IN THE WEST BANK.
WE ARE WAITING FOR WHAT IS 
LIKELY TO BE ANOTHER PASSION 
AETS, POSSIBLY VIOLETE
