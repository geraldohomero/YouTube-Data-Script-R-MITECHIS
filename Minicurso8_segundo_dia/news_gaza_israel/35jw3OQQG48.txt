E
HOUSE.
GOT IT.
DO YOU THINK THE JEWISH
COMMUNITY TYPICALLY VOTING
DEMOCRAT WILL CHANGE?
>> YEAH, STU,S THAT HAS BEEN THE
CASE BUT THE TREND LINES ARE
MOVING TOWARDS THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY AND SO FOR EXAMPLE, IN
2016, PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT 24% OF
THE NATIONAL JEWISH VOTE.
IN 2020 DURING HIS REELECTION,
HE GOT 30% OF THE NATIONAL
JEWISH VOTE AND LAST YEAR IN
2022, RON DESANTIS GOT 45% OF
THE JEWISH VOTE IN FLORIDA AND
LEE ZELDIN GOT 46% OF THE JEWISH
VOTE IN NEW YORK.
THE TREND LINES ARE IMPROVING
AND GETTING GOOD FOR THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND WE VERY
MUCH EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE
INTO THE NEXT ELECTION AS WELL.
STUART: SO YOU SHOULD BECAUSE
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS SPLIT AND
THERE'S FAR TOO MANY AN SEMITES
ON THE LEFT OF THE PARTY.
YOUR GROUP IS COSPONSORING THE
NEXT DEBATE.
HOW BIG OF A ROLE WILL IS IT
PLAY, MIAMI NOVEMBER 8, HOW BIG
A ROLE WILL THE WAR FLAY >> I
FULLY EXPECT FOREIGN POLICY AND
AMERICA'S ROLE IN THE WORLD WILL
BE A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE
DEBATE.
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO
COSPONSORING THE DEBATE AND
FIRST TIME A JEWISH ORGANIZATION
COSPONSORED A NATIONAL
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AND IT'S
REALLY EXCITING AND A GREAT LEAN
IN FROM THE RNC TO REALLY
ELEVATE THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AND
OUR VOICES AS THE HORRIFIC
EVENTS OF OCTOBER 7 IN ISRAEL
HAVE UNFOLDED, AND WE'RE VERY
EXCITED TO HEAR OUR CANDIDATES
VISION FOR WHAT AMERICA'S ROLE
IN THE WORLD IS MOVING FORWARD.
STUART: DID YOU ASK FOR A
POSITION IN THE DEBATE?
>> IT HAD BEEN A CONVERSATION
ONGOING IN THE SUMMER AND EVENTS
IN ISRAEL CAME TO LIGHT, THIS
ORGANIZATION, THE RNC DECIDED IT
WAS IMPORTANT TO ELEVATE RJC AND
JEWISH VOICES IN THE COMMUNITY
TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ISSUES
WERE GIVEN A PLATFORM AND
BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT OF THE
NEXT IMPORTANT DEBATE ON
NOVEMBER 8 IN MIAMI.
STUART: ARE YOU VIEWS GETTING A
BIG ENOUGH PLATFORM IN >> I DO.
I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LED
BY CHAIRWOMAN MCDANIELS AND A
CREATED JOB MAKING SURE THE RJC
AND JEWISH VOICES ARE HEARD IN
THE GOP AS OPPOSED TO
UNFORTUNATELY THE OTHER SIDE
THAT SEEMS TO ELEVATE ALL THE
SONG SORTS OF PEOPLE.
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE
NEXT DEBATE ON NOVEMBER 8.
STUART: SAM, THANK
