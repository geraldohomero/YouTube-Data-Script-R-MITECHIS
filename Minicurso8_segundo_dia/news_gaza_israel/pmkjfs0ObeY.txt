>>> IN GAZA FIGHTING IS 
ESCALATING BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 
HAMAS . THE FIGHTING RIGHT NOW 
REMAINS FOCUSED ON THE CITY IN 
THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE AREA 
THAT IS CROWDED WITH CIVILIANS. 
THIS COMES AS SECRETARY OF 
STATE ANTONY BLINKEN CRITICIZED 
THE HANDLING OF THE WAR BY 
ISRAEL. 
>> AS WE STAND  HERE IT IS 
IMPERATIVE THAT ISRAEL  PUT A 
PREMIUM ON CIVILIAN PROTECTION. 
THERE REMAINS A GAP BETWEEN 
WHAT I SAID, THE INTENT TO 
PROTECT CIVILIANS, AND THE 
RESULTS WE SEE ON THE GROUND. 
>> A VIDEO SHOWS SOLDIERS 
DETAINING MEN AND GUNPOINT 
JOINING IS NOW FROM JERUSALEM 
IS PAUL ADAMS. WAS CAN YOU TELL 
US ABOUT THE LATEST OPERATIONS 
ON THE GROUND IN GAZA? 
>> YOU MENTIONED THE LARGEST 
CITY AND THE IDF SAID WE LOST A 
RAPID AND POWERFUL AND FOCUSED 
OPERATION. THIS IS GOING VERY 
QUICKLY.  THEY BELIEVE IT IS A 
STRONGHOLD OF HAMAS , WHICH IS 
HOW THEY DESCRIBED REMAINING 
AREAS WHERE THERE IS ALSO 
INTENSE FIGHTING GOING ON. 
>> THERE IS A VIDEO THAT SHOWS 
SOLDIERS DETAINING MEN  AND 
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? 
>> Reporter: THIS SEEMED TO 
HAVE BEEN FILMED YESTERDAY AND 
IT IS SHOCKING  FOR THOSE OF US 
WHO ARE NOT IN THE MILITARY TO 
SEE THAT. THEY LOOK HUMILIATED, 
BUT BEAR IN MIND THIS IS AN 
INTENSE BOTTLE IN A CIVIL 
ENVIRONMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
CITY IN AN AREA WITH HAVE BEEN 
WARNING THE POPULATION TO LEAVE 
THEY HAVE ROUNDED UP ANY BY 
TEENAGED MEN THAT THEY CAN FIND
. THEY ARE STARTING TO REALLY 
SOME AND AMONG THOSE SEEN OR 
PALESTINIAN JOURNALISTS AND 
THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE 
CRITICIZED FOR THIS APPROACH 
BUT THEY DO START TO RELEASE 
THE NOW. 
>> THERE IS TALK ABOUT OPENING 
UP ANOTHER CROSSING INTO GAZA 
AND WE HOPE THIS WOULD MEAN THE 
ABILITY TO BRING MORE AID AND I 
DO NOT THINK WE HAVE THE WORDS 
ANYMORE. WE ARE KIND OF RUNNING 
OUT OF WORDS. WHAT IS THE 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS LIKE IN GAZA
? 
>> Reporter: A REPRESENTATIVE 
SAID  85% OF THE POPULATION HAD 
BEEN DISPLACED AND A HUGE 
PROPORTION OF THOSE ARE CRAMMED 
INTO THIS AREA AND I THINK THIS 
TALK ABOUT OPENING A NEW 
CROSSING IS A LITTLE BIT 
MISLEADING AND THIS WOULD ALLOW 
MORE TO GO IN BUT THEY ARE NOT 
TALKING ABOUT OPENING A SECOND 
POINT INTO GAZA. THEY DO NOW 
THAT THERE IS PRESSURE FROM THE 
UNITED STATES TO TRY AND MAKE 
THE SITUATION BETTER
