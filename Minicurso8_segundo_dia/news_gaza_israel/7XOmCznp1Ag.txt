jabalia refugee camp in North Gaza where
the war never seems to
end Israel has been dropping bombs here
for
weeks this woman keeps saying they
bombed us they bombed
us look this is my uncle salum record
this let people
see there's no dignity in a like
this these men say more bodies are
buried under the
rubble the UN says nowhere is
safe and across Gaza desperate demand
for food water and medicine it's hard to
find and cost a
fortune I go to the market looking for
canned food but where do I get the money
to buy it Israelis forced us from one
place to another and now I can't survive
I can't get food for my
children but on the edge of Gaza a small
sign of Hope Israel's Kum Shalom border
crossing Aid trucks are now entering
from here dozens a
day B Hass says this week Israeli forces
killed the head of the Crossing on the
Gaza side in an air strike
the IDF attacked Hamas militants that
came with weapons to our border the IDF
does everything in our power from one
hand to uh reach our objectives of
demolishing the terror regime of Hamas
while operating this large scale
humanitarian
operation but to gazans this isn't
enough they want Karam Shalom Crossing
fully opened it is the main commercial
Crossing into Gaza it's the only one
that can take hundreds and thousands of
trucks into Gaza to try and help the
situation there help must come fast but
diplomats have dithered after a week of
debate the UN Security Council has
finally passed a resolution to increase
Aid to Gaza but not to end the war today
this Council called for Urgent steps to
immediately allow safe unhindered and
expanded humanitarian access and to
create the conditions for a sustainable
sensation of
hostilities it's not far enough for the
UN Secretary General a humanitarian
ceasefire is the only way to begin to
meet the desperate needs of people in
Gaza and end their ongoing
nightmare back in Gaza people wait for
food they wait for the war to end and
the longer it drags on the more they
lose
