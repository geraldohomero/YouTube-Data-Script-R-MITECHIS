S
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.
>>> WE WANT TO GET MORE ON THE
SITUATION ON THE GROUND IN
UKRAINE, DANIELLE JOINS ME NOW
FROM KYIV AND THANK YOU VERY
MUCH AND NOW, WE WERE SAYING
THERE IS A DEADLINE YET ANOTHER
DEADLINE HAS COME AND GONE THEY
GAVE EVERYONE OF US HOLD UP IN
THIS COMPLEX THE FIRST TO LEAVE
OR GIVE UP WE COULD BE HAVE TO
THOUSAND CIVILIANS, WHAT CAN YOU
TELL US ABOUT THAT?
>> COMING OUT OF MARIUPOL TODAY
THIS WAS MADE BY ONE OF THE
MARINE COMMANDERS, HE SAYS THEY
ARE OUTNUMBERED 10 TO ONE BY THE
RUSSIANS.
HE ALSO CLAIMS THERE IS 500
WOUNDED SOLDIERS, WE DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS
THERE ARE, ACCORDING TO THE
RUSSIANS IT'S AROUND 2500 ON TOP
OF THAT A FEW HUNDRED FOREIGN
FIGHTERS, IN THIS VIDEO HE IS
ASKING THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY FOR HELP AND IS ASKING
WORLD LEADERS FOR AN EXTRACTION
PLAN TO THE -- BE EVACUATED
ALONG WITH CIVILIANS BUT ALSO
SAID THEY WERE NOT READY TO
SURRENDER.
THAT DEADLINE WAS AT 7:00 AM
EASTERN IT CAME AND WENT IN
THERE IS NO SIGNS THEY WILL
COMPLY THAT HAS BEEN THE STORY
OF THIS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL
DAYS, THERE WAS AN ULTIMATUM ON
SUNDAY AND ANOTHER ONE YESTERDAY
AND A CLEAR MESSAGE FROM
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY THAT IF THESE
SOLDIERS ARE KILLED THAT COULD
PUT AN END ALTOGETHER TO THE
PEACE TALKS.
C WHAT WE KNOW WHAT THE PEACE
TALKS AT THIS POINT?
>> I THINK AS LONG AS THE
SITUATION IS CATASTROPHIC IN
MARIUPOL, AS LONG AS THEY TRY TO
ESTABLISH EVENT TARRYING
CORRIDOR BECAUSE IT THERE WAS
TALK YESTERDAY BY THE RUSSIANS
THAT THEY HAD IN FACT AGREED TO
HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR WITH 6000
PEOPLE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
EVACUATED TODAY STARTING AT 2:0E
HOURS AGO WE ARE NOT THE
STATUSES JUST YET YOU KNOW, I
THINK UNTIL THERE IS PROGRESS
THESE PEACE TALKS MIGHT NOT GO
VERY FAR AND THE KREMLIN SAYS IT
IS NOW IN UKRAINE THAT THEY HAVE
PASSED THIS DOCUMENT ON THAT
PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HAS JUST SAID
HE HAS NOT HEARD ABOUT AND NOT
SEEN BUT HE DID SAY IN THE PAST
HOUR BEVERLY, HE SAID HE REMAINS
READY TO WALK PETE W.'S IN
EXCHANGE FOR SAFE PASSAGE FOR
CIVILIANS AND TROOPS OUT OF
MARIUPOL BUT THE RUSSIANS HAVE
SAID THE UKRAINIANS ARE
INCONSISTENT AND NOT RELIABLE
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE PEACE
TALKS WOULD AGAIN, I THINK
UNLESS WE SEE PROGRESS IN
MARIUPOL THESE PEA
