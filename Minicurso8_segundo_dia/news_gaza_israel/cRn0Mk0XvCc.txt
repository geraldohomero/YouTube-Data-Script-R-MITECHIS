>> Charles: YOU'RE NOW SEEING 
THE FIRST IMAGES OF TWO AMERICAN
HOSTAGES JUST RELEASED.
HEZBOLLAH IS REPORTEDLY WARNING 
ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES 
THAT THE IRAN BACKED MIDDLE AND 
THE GROUP IS THOUSANDS TIME 
STRONGER THAN BEFORE.
I WANT TO GO TO GREG PALKOT WHO 
IS ON THE ISRAELI LEBANON BORDER
WITH THE VERY LATEST.
GREG?
>> HI, CHARLES.
FIRST TO THE STRIKING IMAGES AND
THAT STRIKING NEWS THE FOLKS IN 
NORTHERN ISRAEL, THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY, THE STATES AND BEYOND.
OF COURSE TAKEN BY THIS 
INFORMATION THAT TWO OF THE 200 
PLUS HOSTAGES THAT THE HAMAS 
MILITANTS HAD TAKEN ARE NOW 
BEING RELEASED.
IT'S BELIEVE THAT JUDITH RAANAN 
AND HER DAUGHTER, 17-YEAR-OLD 
NATALIE RAANAN ARE NOW IN THE 
SAFE HANDS OF THE ISRAELI 
MILITARY.
THEY WERE RELEASED BY HAMAS OR 
THE WHATEVER REASON.
BUT THEY ARE OUT NOW.
THEY SAY FOR HUMANITARIAN 
REASONS.
THE KEY THING IS TWO OF THE 
CAPTIVES SAFELY BACK AMONG THE 
AUTHORITIES HERE IN ISRAEL.
AS WE WATCH AND LISTEN HERE ON 
THIS BORDER, CHARLES AND IT'S 
BECOMING INCREASINGLY ACTIVE, 
THROUGHOUT THIS DAY, WE HAVE 
SEEN 30 MISSILES FIRED AT ISRAEL
OUTGOING BLASTS.
WE JUST HEARD ONE FROM THE 
ISRAELI ARTILLERY POSITION NEAR 
US.
DRONES OVERHEAD.
MILITANT MOTORS UP AND DOWN THIS
BORDER HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE BY 
THE HEZBOLLAH MILITANTS AS THEY 
TRY TO FORM A SECOND FRONT.
ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT WORNING 
AND EVACUATION AND CLASHES IN A 
SUBSTANTIAL TOWN.
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE SAW. 
>> HERE IN THE BORDER TOWN, 
AUTHORITIES ARE NOW TELLING 
PEOPLE TO LEAVE.
TERROR IS CREEPING IN ON ALL 
SIDES.
YESTERDAY SAW SIX MIDDLE ABOUT 
THE ROCKETS RAIN DOWN ON THE 
TOWN.
THREE WERE INJURED.
TODAY A MIDDLE AND THE CAME 
ACROSS THE BORDER AND SHOOT AND 
INJURED AN ISRAELI SOLDIER.
THE THINKING IS THE UPTICK IN 
HEZBOLLAH AND ITS ALLIES ARE 
FIGHTING DUE TO THE LOOMING DUE 
TO THE INVASION DOWN SOUTH.
>> GET OUT.
DON'T TAKE A RISK.
WE'RE IN A WAR AREA, A LOT OF 
BOMB.
A LOT OF TERROR ATTACK.
>> LOTS OF BOMBS, LOTS OF TERROR
ATTACKS.
THE MAYOR OF SHIMONA TOLD US 
THAT HE FEELS THEY'RE NOT 
FIGHTING HAMAS OR HEZBOLLAH.
THEY'RE FIGHTING IRAN.
IN FACT, THAT'S WIDELY THOUGHT 
TO BE THE CASE, THAT THAT IS THE
BENEFACTOR OF THESE TWO GROUPS
