 STUART: THE MARKET SELLING OFF 
 A LITTLE.
 DOWN 150 ON THE DOW 
 INDUSTRIALS, A FORMER NATIONAL 
 SECURITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL JOINS
 ME NOW.
 THEY PRESIDENT TRIED TO LAY 
 DOWN A REDLINE, DON'T, DON'T, 
 DON'T.
 MY QUESTION, WILL THE IRANIANS 
 BELIEVE HE IS CAPABLE OF 
 ENFORCING THAT REDLINE?
 >> IT IS DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, 
 AND IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE 
 SITUATION YOU ARE LOOKING AT 
 THE PRESS BOARD, THIS IS THE 
 DAY THAT HE ALLOWED THE MISSILE
 EMBARGO TO LIFT.
 OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, DOING
 OTHER THINGS IN THE REGION TO 
 IGNORE AIR RANDIAN REPORTS, 
 POTENTIALLY IRAN BACKED 
 MILITIAS HITTING US BASES WITH 
 JOAN STRIKES, IRAN IS TESTING 
 HIM AT IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
 RESPONSE, IT'S A BIFURCATED 
 POLICY, IF YOU GET MORE 
 INVOLVED IN WHAT YOU CREATED 
 MAYBE WE WILL THINK ABOUT DOING
 SOMETHING TO YOU BUT FOR NOW, 
 BACK OFF, YOU CAN HAVE TENS OF 
 BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, YOUR OIL 
 CAN FLOW TO CHINA AND ALLOW 
 RESTRICTIONS TO EXPIRE.
 WHAT'S THE MESSAGE THEY ARE 
 GETTING?
 ARE WE IN AN APPEASEMENT PASTOR
 OR A DETERRENCE POSTURE?
 STUART: WHAT SHOULD THE POSTURE
 BE?
 REIMPOSE OIL SANCTIONS 
 IRANIANS?
 COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY?
 >> FIRST THING, IRAN IS 
 ACCOUNTABLE HERE, IRAN IS 
 COMPLICIT.
 HE HAS NOT SAID WE ARE LOCKING 
 DOWN NOT JUST THE $6 BILLION IN
 QATAR BUT THE $10 BILLION 
 SITTING IN OMAN AS WELL.
 HE DIDN'T SAY WE WILL CRACK 
 DOWN ON THE OIL SANCTIONS AND 
 STOP THE FLOW OF OIL TO CHINA.
 HE'S TRYING TO SEPARATE IRAN, 
 TWO POLICIES THAT CONTRADICT 
 THEMSELVES, GIVING A GREEN 
 LIGHT TO GO AFTER HAMAS BUT IN 
 THE SAME SPEECH SAYS GO SLOW, 
 THINK ABOUT IT, OPEN THE 
 FLOODGATES, TO SUBSIDIZE HAMAS.
 A LOT OF MIXED MESSAGES, IT 
 SHOWS AND ADMINISTRATION 
 STRUGGLING TO MAKE ITS POLICY, 
 WHAT WAS CAUSED BY THAT POLICY?
 I AM OUT OF TI
