Let me start with what happened in the
Middle East conflict with the step
Rafá unfortunately was one of the
places we were talking about
trying not to happen what
Unfortunately it happened as I tell you
In the Egypt border area in this
Case Israel attacked Rafá's passage through
where gaza humanitarian aid enters
Israeli army attacked the area of Rafá
This is the cold step between Israel and
Egypt where trucks from
Humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip
where there is a lot of population
Palestine that was displaced from her home
According to the Gazatí Agency the attacks
Aerreos left 14 dead five children
There are also dozens of injured people
For the bombings to the houses of
families the combat planes of
occupation bombed intense and
violently several neighborhoods of the
city south of the Gaza Strip and the
Occupation Artillery shot tens
of rockets against eastern areas
From the city this said the agency in addition
A bloody day left a balance of
approximately 130 gazatí dead in
total from the north and south of Gaza de
This way the total number of
Deaths amounts to
27840 last figure is the occupation
Israelí committed 15 massacres against
Families in the 30 -dead gauze strip
170 injured this said the ministry in
A statement in which he counted 67,000
In addition, it is estimated that
bodies of some or about 8,000 victims
They are still under the rubble
and that Israeli troops prevent
ambulances and equipment
Civil Protection can arrive in this
I frame the attacks by drones
Israelis in alleys and also streets
of the western region of the city of
Gaza generated a number of deaths that
It cannot yet be determined in the wing
Western the Israeli army affirmed
that stopped two militiamen who
supposedly participated in the massacre
perpetrated by ever on October 7,
2023 with dozens of others
suspicious
