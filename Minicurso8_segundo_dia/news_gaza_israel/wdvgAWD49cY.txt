Unfortunately we have to go to
Middle East because the
Israeli bombings on the strip of
Gaza in the early hours of the day
Today happened again in a
sector that left 19 dead people
The local press also says that it happened
In another in another part of the territory
who says that this is only in Rafá that
It is in the south of the Palestinian enclave there
also 24 people
Unfortunately they died when
two homes were bombarded
This day we are talking about areas
Residential also not the coordinator
United Nations Humanitarian for
occupied Palestinian territories warned
that the current situation is the formula
Perfect for the emergence of a
epidemic health disaster this of the
resurgence of some diseases and
obviously a critical situation in
epidemiological matter is another of the
factors that obviously affect life
of refugees and people who
they had to be displaced and the
World Health Organization too
I have an important focus on this issue
not because obviously the
supplies and medications eh the
International concern at this time
reached the point that Joe Biden the
President of the United States Country
that militarily supports Israel issued
Yesterday your hardest reprimand until the
Date because he pointed out that the bombing
Israeli indiscriminate against Gaza
Weakens your international support this was
what the president of the States said
United is not a minor fact and that is why
adds the Russian request to a high fire
and the non -binding vote of the
United Nations General Assembly
that this week he voted overwhelmingly to
please eh this call to cease the
hostilities and while the army
Israelí Well Enf
growing pressures not to reduce
deaths in their ranks are already 115 dead and
Also to free the regions that
They are still in the hands of
never
