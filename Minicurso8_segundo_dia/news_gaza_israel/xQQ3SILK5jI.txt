Israel evacuated the city of Kiryatchmona
on the border with Lebanon after Ti
Rock shots on the Hebrew state
a city of approximately 25,000 inhabitants per
International Redoute Community
always an overflow of the conflict between
Lebanese Hzbollah supported by Iran
and the Israeli army we find our
Special Méineet envoy to Haa to the north
of Israel why the terrestrial offensive
announced within 24 hours by the
Israeli Prime Minister Netaniahou
has still not started that the
the reasons for this
Delay well listen to Judit is the
question everyone arises here in
Israel and obviously abroad then
The Israeli Defense Minister yesterday
went to the positions with
soldiers who are near the border
with Gaza and and he had this sentence which
made a lot of ink flow here this
who sees Gaza from afar the veron of
The interior then question arose
to know if this speech was
performative if it meant that
The terrestrial offensive was imminent
Nothing is less certain you said it
It's been several days that all
world awaits this terrestrial offensive
which was pushed hand and hand of times
officially in the first 48
hours for humanitarian reasons
eh the official speech of
government was to say that he
left more time to
populations of northern Gaza to
move south and then there was
Information with words
Israeli superior officers who
say it was mainly for
meteorological reasons that he
did not advance on the territory of
Gaza and then after arose the
indeed question of the capacity of
Is the Israeli army in my
measurement in terms of intelligence
indeed but also in terms
logistics to lead this offensive
terrestrial and then the question of
diplomacy that is to say that the more the
time spends more it plays against
Netaniaou and against the Israeli army
since the chancelleries are worried
actually repercussions that this
could have internationally then
in the fog of war what
I tend to say is that we know
only one thing and it is that we do not
know nothing so these are the next
days obviously who will allow us
to see a little more clearly on
This terrestrial offensive thank you very much
Mélina Ette for all your details
for having been with us thank you to you
