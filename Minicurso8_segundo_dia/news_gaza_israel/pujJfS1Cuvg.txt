Admiral Kirby.
Fantastic to catch up with you, sir.
Busy weekend, I'm sure, for you and the
administration.
Let's get straight into it.
We've heard from Iran.
At least they've indicated the matter
can be deemed concluded.
I think we all want to know, Admiral
Kirby, whether Israel has indicated the
same thing.
I won't speak for the Israelis.
I think you can understand that.
I believe the war cabinet is still
deliberating and making their decisions.
The president had a very good
conversation with the prime minister
right after or towards the end of the
attacks on Saturday night.
And the president was was very direct
that this was a huge success, that that
Israel can be proud, that it doesn't
stand alone and that it has superior
military capability.
Iran utterly failed in what they were
trying to achieve, and that that success
alone sends a strong message to Iran and
to the region about Israel's place
there.
So can we just define success?
How can we define the weekend's events
as a success to see the first direct
strikes coming from Iranian soil on
Israel?
How is that a success in any way, shape
or form?
Let's let's talk about what didn't
happen.
Not not, no.
Hardly any damage.
And the only impacts were to an air base
in central Israel.
No real casualties except, sadly, a
young civilian girl was critically
injured.
And the vast majority, as the IDF have
said, 99% of what Iran threw up in the
air drones and missiles never landed,
either failed or actually got shot down.
So that's what didn't happen.
And what did happen was Israel proved it
has superior military capability.
And just as critically, they don't stand
alone that the United States the United
States stands with them.
I think people are maybe
not cognizant of the fact that the
president put U.S.
forces in harm's way to help defend
Israel.
For the first time, American fighter
pilots in the air shooting things down
that were heading towards Israel.
That's that.
And they were extraordinarily successful
in doing so.
I think that's significant.
