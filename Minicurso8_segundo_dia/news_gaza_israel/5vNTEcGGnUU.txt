Following the abhorrent Hamas attacks on 7 
October, the wholesale destruction of Gaza  
and the number of civilian casualties in such a 
short period are totally unprecedented during my  
mandate. This includes 152 of our own UN 
staff members — a heart-breaking tragedy  
for our organization, for their families, 
and for those they were serving in Gaza.
 
While humanitarian workers are doing their best to 
deliver relief, they face constant bombardments,  
daily dangers to themselves and their 
families, and the enormous constraints  
posed by damaged roads, communication 
blackouts and access denials. Meanwhile,  
disease and anger are deepening. People 
are dying not only from bombs and bullets,  
but from lack of food and clean water, 
hospitals without power and medicine,  
and gruelling journeys to ever-smaller slivers 
of land to escape the fighting. This must stop.
 
The refusal to accept the two-state 
solution for Israelis and Palestinians,  
and the denial of the right to statehood for the 
Palestinian people, are unacceptable. This would  
indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become 
a major threat to global peace and security;  
exacerbate polarization; and embolden extremists 
everywhere. The right of the Palestinian people to  
build their own state must be recognized by all.
I will not relent in my call for an immediate  
humanitarian ceasefire and the immediate and 
unconditional release of all hostages. And we  
must do all we can to prevent spillover of this 
conflict across the region — in the West Bank,  
across the Blue Line between Israel and 
Lebanon, and in Syria, Iraq and the Red Sea.
