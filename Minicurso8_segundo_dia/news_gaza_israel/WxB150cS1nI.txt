Pooja is fixed now as if it is fixed
How much can the scope of war move forward
It is visible and some things would have happened
Are we need to do antcipation
Not because she looks on the ground
The way we are watching mobilization
The way the ground forces is a gaze of Israel
The way on the border, the way his diplode is
His tank is a deployment there
If there is diplode there, it is certain that
Gaz has to be targeted and in Gaz
Israel is being said again and again
There is no option for them to ground them
Have to invent and one thing I have to do
Let me tell you more of the help of human help
India has sent it a big aspect
Even the trucks who are the truck towards the gaz
They are entering from the Egyptian Rafa border
All these factor are human help there
People are still going towards South
One issue of hostage has not been able to go there
It is all the issue that Israel is right now
Preventing the operation from launching but
If you see if the statements are coming
The information war is completely
Peak is on and Israel is constantly saying this
If he will remain after the operation, then all this
There are indications that they are telling that Israel
Preparation is complete only some road from the side
There are blocks and some strategies and
That is why this time is very time
It is important and further development
