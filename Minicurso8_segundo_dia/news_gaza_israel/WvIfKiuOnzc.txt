the most powerful man in the world lands
in Israel on
Wednesday President Joe Biden arrives in
Tel Aviv at a time when Israel's tank
regiments are mared along the Gaza
Frontier primed and ready to roll
in when he lands nearly 2 weeks in a
historic escalation between the Hamas
and Israel he brings with him a handful
of deep anxieties
Biden was
unequivocal about his solidarity with
Israel from the
start bloody hands of the terrorist
organization amas a group whose stated
purpose for being is to kill
Jews this was an act of sheer
evil more than 1,000 civilians
slaughtered not just SK slaughtered in
Israel among them at least 14 American
citizens
killed Biden's visit to Israel will be
an incredibly delicate tit trop walk as
the President of the United States he
must come across as nothing but
unambiguously supportive of Israel
empathetic to its anger and
understanding of the steps it is now
taking it matters that Americans see
what's
happening I mean I I I've been doing
this a long
time I never really thought that I would
see and have
confirmed pictures of
terrorists beheading
children I never thought I'd
ever
anyway at the same time with the looming
election in the United States the Israel
Gaza conflict widening into more parts
of the Middle East will mean the United
States has no choice but to get
embroiled the most powerful nation in
the history of that the world and the
history history of the world the history
of the world we can take care of both of
these and still maintain our overall
International defense make no mistake
Biden's response to the Israel Hamas
crisis was the most visible from the
get-go it was on day one itself that he
ordered America's largest warship the
USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier
battle group into Waters of the coast of
Israel as a show of support solidarity
and to beef up intelligence assistance
to the Israeli
military Biden visit to Israel would
have strategic importance for entire
Middle
East the world already has one big war
on its hands in Ukraine a second could
plunge the world into a crisis that goes
beyond just
