You'll see here. I haven't seen the media in my eyes yet
The cameras are Hamas terrorists
Some of them participated on October 7th. There are fighters here
Loaded There is a strong sense of leadership here
In the end, there are terrorists who killed families
Kids don't come to this drain We are
Rim
Stand up
They're hard on all of us, but we're not fighters
A sword and we're not like that Exactly what distinguishes
- You

Fonis Benny Sulla on October and Kedd
It's fine
The cold Fabric that cloth applies
The creek to stress this way. You know everyone
Telling the truth
But it's a terrorist's. The truth is surprising though
The rain is full of people Come open sheep put
Tens of thousands of people from all over the world have fled
People are actually getting out and leaving
Everything
Check out what’s beautiful and what’s happening here
Very, very good mind Someone who has a connection
A family connection, of course, if he does
This was immediately taken to the side We are
And we've been narrow here until now. We've been out for almost a day
400 A company that is either terrorist operatives or affiliated with the Rur
A stranger and Otherwise all the funny things that look
To you, brother, we're as if these poor people are the first ones
They hurt these war pictures - Nothing
It's just that this thing burns the people that they are
They know what it means to be with Israel
It is a war and that is what is happening here
I think these people understand well
What the devil did to them What costs them on the 7th
In October, some of the people here were happy
On that day, but today, they understand very well what it's like
This thing will turn on their heads
