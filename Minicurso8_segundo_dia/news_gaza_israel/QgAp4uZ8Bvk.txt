EGYPT TO DELIVER LIMITED
HUMANITARIAN AID TO GAZA. IT IS
THE FIRST EASE UP IN THE 10
DAY SIEGE OF THE TERRITORY
FOLLOWING A DEADLY HAMAS TERROR
ATTACK.
AS THE WAR INTENSIFIES WITH
EACH PASSING DAY IN THE MIDDLE
EAST, IN THE CITY BOTH
PRO-PALESTINIAN AND PRO-IS
REALLY RALLIES ARE GROWING IN
SIZE.
MANHATTAN HEAR CBS 2'S JOHN
DIAS LIVE IN TIMES SQUARE. WHAT
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT TODAY'S
RALLY?
Reporter: LATER ON TODAY,
THE STREETS HERE IN TIMES
SQUARE WILL BE PACKED FULL OF
PEOPLE OUT HERE SUPPORTING
RALLY ACTUALLY WILL BE A UNIQUE
ONE. LATER THIS MORNING, 15
BILLBOARDS HERE IN TIMES
SQUARE, THEY WILL LIGHT UP WITH
HOSTAGE, THESE PRISONERS OF
WAR, AND ALSO HOLOGRAMS WILL BE
OUT HERE OF THEIR FAMILIES
DEMANDING THEIR RELEASE.
I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GOING
TO SEE THEM.
PARALYZING FEELING FOR THOSE
WHO HAVE LOVED ONES BEING HELD
HOSTAGE BY HAMAS ALONG THE GAZA
ON THE EAST SIDE, DOZENS OF
FLYERS WERE HELD UP SHOWCASING
NAMES AND FACES OF THE ALMOST
200 PEOPLE THOUGHT TO BE IN
CAPTIVE.
PRIORITIZE THE HOSTAGES .
PRIORITIZE THE LIVES OF ALL THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUGHT IN THE
CROSSHAIRS OF BAD ACTORS.
Reporter: THE RALLY WAS
HOSTED BY SEVERAL GROUPS,
INCLUDING THE AMERICAN JEWISH
COMMITTEE AND THE YOU JC
FEDERATION OF NEW YORK. THERE
WERE PRAYERS. BUT CALLS FOR
ACTION WERE ALSO HEARD LOUDLY,
LIKE THIS ONE FROM MANHATTAN
BOROUGH PRESIDENT MARK LEVINE.
WE ARE DEMANDING THE
IMMEDIATE AND AN UNCONDITIONAL
RELEASE OF EVERY SINGLE HOSTAGE
HELD BY HAMAS. EVERY MAN AND
WOMAN, EVERY CHILD, EVERY
ONE , WE WANT THEM HOME
SAFELY.
Reporter: I WAS LATER IN
QUEENS , A MASSIVE CROWD
RALLIED TO DOWN STEINWAY STREET
IN ASTORIA FOR BLOCKS ON END,
CALLING ATTENTION TO THE LIVES
LOST IN GAZA THIS WEEK AND THE
ONGOING EXTREMITIES PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH.
WE ARE HERE, THEIR VOICE. WE
ARE HERE TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE.
WE ARE HERE TO MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT PALESTINE
HAS TO BE FREED.
Reporter: SINCE THE WAR
BROKE OUT, THEY TELL US ATTACKS
AGAINST THEIR PEOPLE HAVE
SURGED ACROSS AMERICA.
I'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN
KIND OF HATRED TOWARDS MUSLIMS
RELATED WITH THAT.
Reporter: BACK HERE LIVE IN
TIMES SQUARE, WE ARE TOLD MAYOR
ERIC ADAMS WILL ALSO BE AT
TONIGHT RALLY. HE'S ALREADY
SHOWN SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. FOR
NOW, LIVE THIS MORNING FROM
TIMES SQUARE, JOHN DIAS, CBS 2
