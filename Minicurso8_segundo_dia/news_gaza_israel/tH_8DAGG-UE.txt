at times the Janine refugee camp seems
like it's been hit by an
earthquake for
locals signs of Destruction are more
like scars in their fight against the
Israeli
occupation there's not a single building
around here that doesn't have bullet
holes or hasn't been hit by shrapnel
this neighborhood specifically is often
targeted by the Israeli military it's
where most of the militants were born
and where their families still
live and those homes are destroyed as
punishment for carrying out what Israel
says are Terror
attacks welc come to C we search the
freedom various armed Palestinian
factions roam the
streets Mahmud Abu talal was once a
fighter himself
[Music]
now he guides a new
generation teaching young men how to hit
run and disappear when Israeli soldiers
enter the
camp Janine is Ground Zero for the
Palestinian resistance in the West Bank
but Israel sees it as a hot bed of
terrorists with a growing arsenal of
weapons
as night falls the fighters emerge ready
to clash with Israeli forces J abdalah
is with Islamic Jihad which is backed by
Iran and whose fighters in Gaza took
part in the October 7th
attacks it's also the dominant force in
Janine his Allegiance is based more on
funding than ideology he tells us
Islamic Jihad is providing most of the
money and weapons what is your
[Music]
goal abdalah is 25 and like many here a
former
prisoner they know their M16 rifles are
no match against Israeli drones and
heavy armor but they refuse to stand by
when Israeli Special Forces raid their
camp
this was the scene hours
earlier since October 7th Israeli
incursions have been more frequent and
more violent this video was seen around
the world two boys 8 and 15 years old
shot Not Dead in broad
daylight we want to live in this region
two states but there is no security and
Beast to Israeli people without
insecurity and Beast to Palestinian
people in Gaza in J in Jerusalem
everywhere those killed are revered as
Martyrs their images hang everywhere as
tributes
