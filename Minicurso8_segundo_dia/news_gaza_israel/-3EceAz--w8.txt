this
life and I mean this literally when the
pure unadulterated evil is Unleashed on
this
world the people of Israel live through
one such moment this

terrorist organization ofas a group
whose stated purpose for being is to
kill Jews

evil more than 1,000 civilians
slaughtered not just killed slaughtered
in
Israel among them at least 14 American
citizens
killed parents butchered using their
bodies to try to protect their
children stomach turning reports of
being babies being killed entire family
slain young people massacred while
attending a musical festival to
celebrate peace to celebrate
peace women raped assaulted paraded as
trophies
families hid Their Fear for hours and
hours desperately trying to keep their
children quiet to avoid drawing
attention and thousands of
wounded alive but carrying with them the
bullet holes and the shrap the wounds
and the memory of what they
endured you all know these traumas never
go
away there's still so many families
desperately waiting to hear the fate of
their loved ones not knowing if they're
alive or dead or
hostages infants in their mother's arms

threatened to execute in violation of
every code of human
morality it's

Terrorism but sadly for the Jewish
people it's not

surface painful memories and the scars
left by a millennia of anti-Semitism and
genocide of the Jewish
people so in this
moment we must be Crystal Clear we stand
