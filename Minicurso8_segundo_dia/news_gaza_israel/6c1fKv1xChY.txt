meanwhile the israeli prime minister
benjamin netanyahu has said that the
golan heights
will remain under israeli sovereignty
the golan heights was and will remain
part of the state of israel
with or without an agreement we are not
withdrawing from the golan heights
this will remain a sovereign part of the
state of israel
now his statement of course comes the
day after the u.s secretary of state
anthony blinken was remarked that
stopped shot
of recognizing the claim lincoln said on
monday that he saw control of the
plateau that is the golan heights as
being important
to israel's security but was very about
recognizing israeli sovereignty over the
territory
remember in what is dubbed as a bit of a
historic move the former u.s
president donald trump had recognized
the golan
heights as israeli territory
making the united states the first
nation to in fact
do so remember israel had
actually illegally captured the golan
heights in 1967
from syria and later went on to in fact
an exit in 1981.
the land originally belongs to syria and
under the two-state solution
this is land or which israel can have no
control whatsoever
now golan heights is a plateau along the
north of israel's border with syria it
also borders lebanon and jordan
the region commands a strategic position
and is exceptionally rich in water
resources which makes it important for
israel or at least that is what it
claims the possession of the golan
heights provides israel with a
significant strategic advantage
as it is one of the highest points in
the region and is said to be just 60
kilometers
from the syrian capital of damascus
now syria had at the time described
donald trump's decision is a clear
violation
of syrian sovereignty syria has long
demanded the return of the gulan heights
now israel's annexation of the area has
not been in
recognized internationally except by the
trump administration
