DIRECT MILITARY ATTACK ON 
IRANIAN SOIL
THE NEWS COMES DAYS AFTER IRAN
LAUNCHED ITS FIRST EVER DIRECT
ATTACK ON ISRAEL IN THE FORM OF 
MORE THAN 300 DRONES AND
MISSILES
NBC'S RICHARD ENGEL JOINS US NOW
FROM JERUSALEM WITH MORE
RICHARD?
>> Reporter: SO, THIS STRIKE WAS
LIMITED.
ISRAELI OFFICIAL TELLING NBC
NEWS THAT THE STRIKE TOOK PLACE,
IRANIANS SAY THAT A MILITARY
BASE NEAR THE CITY OF ISFAHAN 
WAS TARGETED
BUT EVEN THE IRANIANS ARE 
DOWNPLAYING THIS WITH STATE 
TELEVISION SHOWING PICTURES FROM
ISFAHAN WITH LIFE AS NORMAL, ONE
ANCHOR ON STATE TELEVISION SAID 
THAT THIS WAS, QUOTE, NO BIG
DEAL
HERE IN ISRAEL, THEY HAVE NOT 
IMPOSED ANY NEW RESTRICTIONS OR 
GUIDANCE
PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING TOLD TO GO 
TO SHELTERS OR LIMIT THEIR
BEHAVIOR IN ANY WAY.
PEOPLE ARE OUT ON THE STREETS,
HERE IN JERUSALEM, TEL AVIV VERY
MUCH THE SAME.
ISRAEL HAD PROMISED TO RESPOND
TO THE IRANIAN ATTACKS, WHICH 
WERE TRIGGERED BY AN INITIAL
ISRAELI STRIKE ON AN IRANIAN
DIPLOMATIC FACILITY IN SYRIA
BUT IT DOES SEEM NOW AFTER THIS 
LIMITED STRIKE THAT BOTH SIDES, 
JUDGING THE REACTION THAT WE'RE 
SEEING, ARE TRYING TO PULL BACK 
FROM THE BRINK AND NOT HAVE THIS
SPILL INTO A REGIONAL WAR.
SO, WE DID SEE A STRIKE THIS
MORNING, LIMITED IN SCALE, AND
SO FAR THE REACTION HAS BEEN
QUITE MUTED.
>> HAS IRAN EVEN ATTRIBUTED THE 
ATTACK TO ISRAEL
>> Reporter: THE SUGGESTION IN
IRAN IS THAT THIS WAS ISRAEL, 
AND IF YOU -- THE COMMENTATORS
ON IRANIAN TELEVISION ARE 
DESCRIBING IT AS A WIN FOR IRAN.
THEY'RE SAYING THAT WHAT
HAPPENED A FEW DAYS AGO, WHEN 
OVER THE WEEKEND, WHEN IRAN 
LAUNCHED MORE THAN 300 BALLISTIC
MISSILES, DRONES, CRUISE
MISSILES, THAT IRAN SENT SUCH A 
STRONG MESSAGE TO ISRAEL THAT 
ISRAEL WAS AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING
MORE THAN THE MOST MINIMAL KIND 
OF ATTACK THAT IT CARRIED OUT 
THIS MORNING
SO, BOTH SIDES ARE TRYING TO
WALK AWAY FROM THIS WITH A WIN, 
AND THAT, FRANKLY, I
