they were Target systematically car by
car this happened over more than 1.5 1.8
kilometers so this was not just a bad
luck situation where oops we dropped the
bomb in the wrong place or or no this
was over 1.5 1.8 kilometers with a very
defined humanitarian Convoy that had
signs in the top in the roof a very
colorful logo that we are obviously very
proud St but that that's very clear who
we are and what we do technology today
allows you to know things in ways not to
long ago was not possible those drones
Have Eyes on everything that moves in
gasa I've been there this is drones
nonstop flying above you is nothing that
moves that idea doesn't know I will
never imagine that Hunger Games will it
be a movie and it seems that what is
happening is like like true Hunger Games
this has to end and this can end only
with one fun call one one person alone
this is fire that can allow the
opportunity to no more hostages die this
is fire that will give the opportunity
to children to feel once once and for
all to sleep one night feeling they are
safe the humanitarians and
civilians should never be paying the
consequences of War this is a basic
principle of humanity at the at the time
this looks like it's not a war against
terrorism anymore seems this is a war
against humanity itself you cannot be
destroying every building you cannot be
destroying every hospital every school
you cannot be targeting humanitarian you
cannot be targeting
children you cannot be fighting the
basis of what Humanity should be
standing for I will tell
to prime minister Netanyahu two 200
humanit Ians have died already tens of
thousands of civilians have
died I'm so sorry but I I think one
humanitarian life is one too many
one one children is one too
many
