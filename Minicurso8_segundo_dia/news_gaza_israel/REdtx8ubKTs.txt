PALESTINIAN AMERICANS, AND THE
PALESTINIAN AMERICANS, AND THE
U.S. JEWISH COMMUNITY, ARE BOTH
HOLDING RALLIES, AND MAKING
THEIR VOICES HEARD TODAY.
OUTSIDE THE ISRAELI CONSULATE
IN NEW YORK, A MIX OF
PROTESTERS, ON BOTH SIDES OF
THE, ISSUE BEGAN RALLYING ABOUT
AN HOUR AGO.
NBC'S MARISSA --
IS JOINING US FROM MIAMI BEACH,
FLORIDA.
THAT IS A HUB FOR JEWISH AND
ISRAELI AMERICANS.
BUT WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN WITH
NBC'S MAGGIE VESTA, WHO IS IN
CHICAGO, AT A PRO PALESTINIAN
RALLY.
SO, AS I WELCOME BOTH OF YOU.
MAGGIE, TELL US WHAT YOU ARE
HEARING FROM THE FOLKS THERE,
THOSE BEHIND YOU IN THAT MARCH?
>> HI ALL, IT YOU CAN HEAR --
RIGHT AS WE SAID, THIS IS A PRO
PALESTINIAN RALLY, WHICH IS
MARCHING THROUGH THE HEART OF
DOWNTOWN CHICAGO RIGHT NOW, WE
ARE IN MADISON AND CLARK
CHICAGO.
AND THAT MEANS THEY ARE
SHUTTING A HUGE --
IN THIS CITY.
AND, --
MORE YOU CAN HEAR THE CHANTING.
IN THE BACKGROUND I
[CROWD CHANTING]
.
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF PEOPLE HERE.
THIS STARTED AT THE ISRAELI
CONSULATE, WHICH IS A PRO
PALESTINE RALLY, THAT BEGAN
OUTSIDE THE ISRAELI CONSULATE,
HERE IN DOWNTOWN CHICAGO.
AND NO ONE WANTS TO SEE
VIOLENCE, BUT THEY SAY BASED ON
THE OF VIOLENT HISTORY BETWEEN
THESE TWO NATIONS, THE ACTIONS
OF HAMAS DO NOT SURPRISE THEM.
IT --
IS IN WHAT'S CALLED LITTLE
PALESTINE, IT IS A CHICAGO
SUBURB, IN THE SOUTHWEST OF THE
CITY.
LISTEN TO WHAT SOME PEOPLE TOLD
US THERE.
>> WE WON'T LOSE HOPE, BUT IT
IS SOMETHING, ESPECIALLY WITH
THE WESTERN MEDIA IN AMERICA,
IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE USED TO
AT THIS POINT, SEEING THE ONE
SIDE CONVERSATION, IN HOW
PEOPLE SUPPORT ISRAEL ALL THE
TIME, AND WE CAN GET HURT OVER
THAT ANYMORE, BECAUSE IT IS
KIND OF THE NORM NOW.
BUT, WE GET HAPPY, AND WE HAVE
HOPE WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE SIDING
WITH US.
THAT'S WHEN WE ARE ACTUALLY
SURPRISED.
LIKE, OH MY GOD, FINALLY.
>> THEY DO NOTHING FOR US.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.
SO, WE ARE AGAINST KILLING
CIVILIANS.
WE ARE AGAINST THAT, YOU KNOW.
BUT, WHEN THE WAR HAPPENED, YOU
KNOW.
>> I'LL WRITE, BACK HERE LIVE
ONCE AGAIN.
THIS IS A PRO PALESTINE RALLY,
MARCHING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF
DOWNTOWN CHICAGO.
I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE OVER THE
TOP OF THIS, BUT THIS GOES BACK
FOUR BLOCKS.
PEOPLE HERE ARE MARCHING DOWN
THE HEART OF THE CITY, --
TRULY THE ANGLE HERE, --
IS PALPABLE.
