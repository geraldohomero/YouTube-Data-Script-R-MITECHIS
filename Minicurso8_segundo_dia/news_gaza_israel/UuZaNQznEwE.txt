Mr President
excellencies I welcome this opportunity
to brief the security Council on
implementation of resolution
2712 over the past few days the people
of the occupied Palestine territory and
Israel have finally seen a glimmer of
hope and Humanity in so much
Darkness it is deeply moving to see
civilians finally having a respite from
the
bombardments families reunited and
life-saving Aid
increasing I welcome the arrangement re
reached by Israel and Hamas with the
assistant of the governments of Qatar
Egypt and United
States we are working to maximize the
positive potential of this Arrangement
on the humanitarian situation in
Gaza the pause has enabled us to enhance
the delivery evade into and across
Gaza intense negotiations are taking
place to prolong the truth which we
strongly welcome but we believe we need
a true humanitarian
ceasefire and we must ensure the people
of the region finally have an horizon of
Hope by moving in a determined and
irreversible way towards establishing a
two-state solution on the basis of
United Nations resolutions and
international law with Israel and
Palestine living side by side in peace
and
security it is clear that before the
pause we witness serious
violations beyond the many civilians
killed and wounded that I have spoke of
80% of gaza's people have now been
forced from their
homes the growing popula the growing
population is being pushed to this
growing population is being pushed
towards an Ever smaller area of Southern
Gaza and of course nowhere is safe in
