yeah you know really the the devil is in
the details here and when you look at
the numbers closely
87 in favor of 57 against 33 abstaining
meaning
16 countries didn't even vote today at
the u.n
and what is more important is that the
us got the total backing of the european
union nations
and as to whether this is a win or lose
for nikki haley the outgoing u.s
ambassador
i asked her former spokesperson jonathan
wachtel what his reaction is let's hear
what he had to say
the majority of nations this afternoon
voted
for the united states's resolution that
is a triumph
if it had gone the other way then you
would question whether
there was some sort of gain for the
united states in this
but the majority of nations voted for
this and hamas for the first time
was put on watch it would have meant a
defining
victory for us ambassador nikki haley
she was really looking to
go out on this vote today as as really
declaring a huge victory
for her tenure here as u.s ambassador
but as we see
it's it's a two-thirds vote it did win
the popular vote
and hamas is like jonathan wachtel being
put on watch
and this is i think really sends a
message to everybody at the un
that you know they're all kind of really
fed up with what is going on as far as
the violence between the palestinians
and the israelis
there's a lot of you know considerable
you know collateral kind of damage
between
both sides that is there's a lot of
people that are saying look each is to
blame
but each has to really behave and
there's been events like the
discovery of the tunnels but then of
course we had the event where
there was israeli raid into an area
where they really shouldn't have been
that are drawing you know the ire of a
lot of people here at the u.n but i
don't think it's really
likely that we're going to get a general
assembly vote down the road
that's going to totally outright say
that the entire general assembly is
against hamas
but this is definitely a defining day
along those lines for nikki haley
