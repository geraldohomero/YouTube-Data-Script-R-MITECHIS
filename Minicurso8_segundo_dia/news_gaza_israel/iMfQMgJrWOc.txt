War pulled life from the heart of
Gaza it left a
wasteland smoke still
rises today it's only a digger clearing
some of the
rubble gazin put up signs to describe
what stood here which family lost it
what number to call to deliver
help but almost none has arrived
the Ki family's home was destroyed in
Israeli artillery fire just before the
ceasefire 6 months ago their first son
badha was
born last month he froze to death in
what is now another battle just to
survive his grandmother fatia points an
accusing finger at all Arab countries
saying they haven't helped
Gins W's mother says nobody
did all countries take care of their
children and people all countries except
here here the people in charge just sit
in their chairs they care only for their
own children they forget about
us now they just want to rebuild their
home so their two girls will survive
everyone talks about rebuilding Gaza but
nobody's doing it and as always here
there's more than one reason Israeli
restrictions Palestinian infighting the
failure of donors to keep their promises
and why would there be much rebuilding
when everyone fears there'll be another
War 10,000 gazin still live in un
schools and that number may rise when
fam's money Runs
Out you think conflict's inevitable
whether it's internal conflict or
another conflict between Gaza and Israel
unless the situation on the ground
changes uh there will be no other action
for people to take other than a
resumption of
violence and Hamas Fighters are ready
they don't hide it I've seen marches
like this on almost every visit in
recent months main reason for all this
catastrophe is occupation now Gaza is
turned to be like a bigger brison
there's no exit no import no export but
there are reports credible reports that
Hamas is again digging tunnels that
Hamas has been test firing missiles in
preparation look I think this war this
is true that's right but I think that
Hamas is doing this in order to protect
our people here we don't want to be
surprised with a new war a new
aggression against
us in the ruins of Gaza young men train
in parkour the sport of overcoming
obstacles resilient gin are good at that
but after three Wars in six years even
the strongest are starting to
break least to set BBC news
