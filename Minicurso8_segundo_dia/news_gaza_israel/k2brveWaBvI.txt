there was one person that I was
sure that doesn't hate me and someone
who kissed my hand while un treated him
and there was one young guy that I felt
that didn't make eye contact with
me um and that's like one of the people
that eventually I like found out later
it was in Israel October

7th
[Applause]
[Music]
we saw terrorists going from one room to
another or from one building to another
inside a group of of
children like using them as a human
shield
um and
then again I'm I'm I feel I'm lucky I
don't need to deal this situation
on my own because I think it's so
complicated and so
hard because you need to like you
at as many citizens as you can in this H
humanitary uh cord but on the other hand
you need to watch your soldiers who are
honestly also kids let's say that okay
they are 18
19 like I look at them and for me
they're like I don't feel they're almost
my age I I I feel like they're kids
because really 18 19 it's
like most of them are not Reserve
soldiers
or that's their military service that is
mandatory
Israel we choose to do that but we also
don't choose to do that like we don't
have other choice so on on the one hand
you need to evacuate the citizens of
Gaza from this complex situation but on
the other hand you have to keep your
people your soldiers that are also
kids alive and protected as much as you
can there were like I think hundreds of
people there and going south with white
fls uh and and I saw children on this
like the same age ages as my daughters
and and um you know
kids
that like shouldn't have experienced
like that you
feel like sad and and anger at this word
that it shouldn't be like that but also
on the other hand you feel afraid
because behind this line of people
that most of them are probably really
just citizen but there there could be a
terrorist behind them targeting at us at
the very same moment so that was also a
very complex situation and I like from
how I know myself on a normal day to see
kids like
that going like escaping from war zone
would make me cry I do understand why
I'm there and that we don't have another
option and still it it it hurts to say
that
