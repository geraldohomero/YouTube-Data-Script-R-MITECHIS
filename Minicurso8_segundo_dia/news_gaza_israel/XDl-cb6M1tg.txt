OF 100 PALESTINIANS AT AN EIGHT
GONE BOY IN GAZA CITY ON
THURSDAY.
ISRAELI FORCES ARE ACCUSED OF
OPENING FIRE ON A CROWD, HOPING
TO GET FOOD.
LET'S BRING IN NBC'S MATT
BRADLEY WHO'S IN LONDON FOR US
WITH THE VERY LATEST ON THIS.
MATT, IF YOU CAN, WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT THIS FIRST ROUND OF
DROPS?
>> YASMIN, THE U.S. OFFICIALS
HAVE SAID THAT THIS WAS DONE IN
COOPERATION WITH THE
JORDANIANS.
THEY'VE BEEN CONDUCTING THEIR
OWN EIGHT DROPS INTO GAZA EVER
SINCE EARLY NOVEMBER.

GAZA IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH.
NOW, -- INNOCENT LIVES ARE ON
THE LINE, AND CHILDREN'S LIVES
ARE ON THE LINE.

WE SHOULD GET HUNDREDS OF
TRUCKS IN.

FOOD AID ARE BECOMING A
