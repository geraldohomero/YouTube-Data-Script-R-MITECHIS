We talk about the war of
Middle East but from another plane of
The cybernetic question Irina to see and
You know that since June comes a series of
Attacks around the world related to
The Palestine Israel war and a group of
Argentine computer experts noticed
this and made an extension of a site
which is a search engine that is called
I was leaked to me to highlight the
factions and different attacks in
this site we are seeing that
calls Israel leaked me and we can
See a timeline of all
Attacks from May onwards
that grew exponentially after
October that have greater
predominance of factions and
CIBER GROUP ATTACHING GROUPS
not anti -Semitic jihadists
Pro Palestinas and very little alliances
Pro Israel evidently in this aspect
They are much more organized and in this
This site will be able to see the 141
attacks that detected worldwide
But the interesting thing is that there were three in
Argentina good here account for the
region in Brazil in Uruguay and in
Argentina and I tell you how they did
For example the library site
of the Nation Congress was hacked
For two days he was disfigured as
It is said that they delete it and do it
A digital graffe with a legend a
message
Chinese politician who says Free Palestine
Argentine operation also the site of
The University of Concepci√≥n del Uruguay
that directly to this site does not
They left a banner of this message
political and then there was a filtration
of data related to the government and
those reads reads as they are known are
still circling the network is
Interesting this because who is a bit
More Nero who wants to analyze in a way
free in this search engine you can see from
Where each of the attacks comes
Who were the authors that many
sometimes the authors are signed on
countries come who allied who
no and how was the evolution in time
And of course in the good region it is a
Attention call to reinforce
Security measures but clear
totally especially this issue
Central that you did those three attacks
To the Argentine Republic thanks Irina
