NEGOTIATORS GETTING CLOSER  TO 
AGREEMENT. 
>> WE WANT TO BRING IN PAUL 
SALEM.  QATARI MEDIATORS HAVE 
REALLY BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER 
THE STILL AND SAID  ISRAEL AND 
HAMAS ARE LOOKING AT THE TERMS 
OF A TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE AND 
TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF QATAR . 
>> QATAR HAS MAINTAINED 
RELATIONS FOR MANY YEARS . IT 
WAS QUITE THE STRATEGY TO KEEP 
HAMAS IN GAZA AND FIGURED THEY 
WOULD NOT  POSE A MAJOR THREAT 
BUT THAT IT WOULD REMAIN IN 
THOSE LIMITS. IN THE PAST THEY 
WERE IN CONTACT WITH HAMAS AND 
NOW  THEY CAN ASK TO TRY TO 
SECURE THE RELEASE OF THE 
HOSTAGES. 
>> PAUL, IF A DEAL IS 
SUCCESSFUL IT WAS TO 200 STILL 
REMAINING. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
NEXT? WHAT ARE THE SIMPLE BASIC 
QUESTIONS?  WHY DOESN'T HAMAS , 
WHICH IS CLEARLY ON THE RUN 
WITH LIMITED RESOURCES, WHY 
DON'T THEY SURRENDER? 
>> IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE 
THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT MUCH 
REGARD FOR THE LIVES OF 
PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS WHEN THEY 
STAGED THE ATTACK OCTOBER 7. 
ANYONE WOULD KNOW THAT ISRAEL  
WOULD RETALIATE, WHICH IT HAS 
DONE. IT IS AN EXTREMIST 
MOVEMENT. THEY ARE NOT 
MEASURING THINGS AND THOSE SORT 
OF TURNS. THEY'RE IN IT FOR 
LONG-TERM. 
THAT MEANS PALESTINIAN 
CIVILIANS TO THE CROSSFIRE. 
THIS CURRENT NEGOTIATION HAS 
BEEN GOING ON ALMOST ONE MONTH. 
THEY WERE OPEN TO RELEASE IN 
SOME OF THESE HOSTAGES. WE DO 
NOT KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER. 
THERE MIGHT BE ABOUT 80 OR 100 
CIVILIANS. 
>> WHAT IS REALLY THE END GAME 
HERE? WE SAW OVER THE WEEKEND 
PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYING THAT A 
TWO STATE SOLUTION IS THE ONLY 
WAY TO SECURE LONG-TERM 
SECURITY AND WHO SHOULD CONTROL 
GAZA? 
>> MATT RHULE IS A FUNDAMENTAL 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES ADMINISTRATION AND MOST 
GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. 
RIGHT NOW IT IS A BATTLE IN THE 
UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL  
DISAGREE ABOUT THE END GOAL AND 
FOR THE NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT IT 
IS TO  RE-ESTABLISH CONTROL 
OVER GAZA. HE SAID THEY WOULD 
STAY. 
THE OCCUPATION OF THE WEST BANK 
HAS BEEN GOING ON 66 YEARS NOW 
AND GAZA HAS BEEN UNDER SIEGE 
17 YEARS. 
PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID THE 
INTERSTATE COULD BE A TWO STATE 
SOLUTION AND BRING IN THE ARAB 
COUNTRIES AND CREATE A STATE 
FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND LIVING 
SIDE-BY-SI
