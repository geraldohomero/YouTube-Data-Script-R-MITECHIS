British Foreign Minister David Cameron
Ukraine's West for training purposes
It means to oppose the dispatch of the army
I told you that Cameron is local time
With the difference between Germany issued on the 9th
In the interview, he revealed this position
AFP communication, etc.
He reported Ukraine in the West
Is it appropriate to exclude the dispatch?
Training missions are the most
It is good and we are 60,000 Ukrainians
Trained soldiers
Then we are clear to President Teen
You shouldn't make a target
The West said that the Ukrainian army
If you send it, it will be a Russian attack target.
The intention is that it can be done earlier
French President Macron said on the 26th of last month
After the Ukrainian Support International Meeting
At the press conference,
There is no possibility
Controversy
It was raised
Prime Minister Rishi of Doksji
A few who support the Ukrainian army
There is no large -scale dispatch plan for manpower
The goodness of the soup was rejected by the soup
The French side sends a combat troop
Although it is explained, military training
The plan to dispatch for mine removal missions
Without bending the opinion that it can be considered
There is a chapter in the UK
Long distance to Ukraine in the interview
Emphasize that missile support is effective
To refuse to support the Taurus missile in Germany
All countries make sovereign decisions
I told you that I should get off
Long distance missiles with limited range
I supported Storm Shadow, but Germany was confirmed
Concerned about the possibility
Taurus missile support even at the request
Rejection of Germany
If you supply Taurus in the UK, the UK
Instead of Ukraine's Storm Shadow
By limiting ways to supply
Although it is known, the Minister of Cameron
Avoid specific mentions and all options
I'm ready to consider
