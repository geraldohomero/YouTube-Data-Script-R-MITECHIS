it was the most serious flare-up in the
gaza frontier for more than a year
israeli forces pounded gaza for three
days starting on friday when it launched
what it called preemptive strikes
against the palestinian islamic jihad or
pij
israel said it had anticipated an attack
in revenge for the arrest of a pij
leader
israel's iron dome interceptor shot down
palestinian rockets which fighters had
fired in response to the bombardment
an egyptian brokered ceasefire came into
effect late on sunday pij rockets and
israeli strikes continued in the minutes
leading up to the beginning of the truce
the announcement led to celebrations
i don't think that the ceasefire comes
as both parties in here islamic yet and
also israel
we're not looking for a long
engagement military engagement this is
comes as the gaza strip has been going
through many type of attacks by israel
and also israel israeli government with
lapid does not want a prolonged conflict
that will impact his
possibility of
uh election campaign that is ongoing so
in this sense both parties were looking
for a way to ne to negotiate a ceasefire
but we'll have to wait and see whether
this will be uh sustainable
dazed by another surge of bloodshed
palestinians on sunday picked through
the ruins of their houses to salvage
belongings
it's a disgusting crime against
civilians and residents it's a crime
against children young people and the
elderly in this area with no warning
they didn't give any heads up to anyone
they hit the area and destroyed it
completely
gaza officials said 44 palestinians
including 15 children were killed
israel has blamed several of the deaths
on pig rockets that fell short the truce
appeared to hold as the sun rose over
gaza city on monday
and the karem shalom goods crossing to
southern gaza reopened for fuel and
other supplies to reach the blockaded
enclave with both sides warning of a
forceful response to any infractions of
the ceasefire claire herriot trt world
