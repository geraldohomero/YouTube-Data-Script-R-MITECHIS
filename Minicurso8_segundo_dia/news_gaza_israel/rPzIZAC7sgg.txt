the most alarming findings are those
related to security
we found that the way that it transmits
data
is very insecure
so normally when you transmit
sensitive data
you want to make sure of course that
it's encrypted which this app does
but there's there's another part to this
too which is that
you want to make sure that it's being
encrypted to the person to whom you want
it to be encrypted to
um and what we found is that
this app doesn't actually ensure that
it's supposed to check something called
an ssl certificate
and it doesn't do that check so what can
happen is you can end up connecting
to a host that you didn't intend to
um and this host can be intercepting
all the data that you're transmitting
using the sound
so the kinds of data that you'd be
transmitting using zap
are a
information like passport numbers uh
your name other sorts of personal
details like that
but also medical information
uh so your vaccination status test
results part of the app
is something called a health customs
form which are required to fill out
uh before you arrive in china
in order to enter the country
um
and this includes lots of personal
information lots of medical information
then also to get around in china um you
need to maintain something called a
green health code
and then that also uh
requires you to transmit those same
kinds of data
it's hard to recommend someone uninstall
the app if they're required to use it
to attend the olympics
um but if you do have to
use the app
um there are some things you can do to
ameliorate your risk which is to use it
on
networks that you trust so if you
haven't left for china yet
your most trustworthy network is
probably your home network
um
of course you know once you're traveling
you might be on hotel wi-fi you might be
on coffee shop wi-fi
those networks aren't as trustworthy
it's something you can do especially if
you have a vpn that you know works in
china
and
that is on a network that you trust you
can use that vpn
to give you protection
even when you're traveling abroad
