DOES MOVE IN, IT COULD BE
DEVASTAT
DEVASTATING FOR ISRAEL.
>> HEZBOLLAH IS BACKED BY IRAN,
HAMAS IS BACKED BY IRAN.
THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT
THE $6 BILLION THE U.S. WAS
GOING TO UNFREEZE FOR
HUMANITARIAN MATERIALS TO IRAN,
AND OFFICIALS WERE ASKED ABOUT
IT TODAY.
WHAT DID THEY SAY?
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, JOHN
KIRBY WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS TODAY
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HEARD ABOUT
THIS IN NBC'S OWN REPORTING FROM
WALLY, THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF
THE TREASURY.
HE TOLD HOUSE DEMOCRATS THEY
WERE GOING TO BLOCK THE 6
BILLION, AND, YOU KNOW, KATY,
THIS HAS BEEN A FAVORITE RIGHT
WING TALKING POINT SINCE
SATURDAY THAT THE U.S. WAS
FINANCING TERROR.
JOHN KIRBY ADDRESSED THAT
DIRECTLY.
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.
>> WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS EVERY
SINGLE DIME OF THAT MONEY IS
STILL SITTING IN A QATAR BANK.
NOT ONE DIME HAS BEEN SPENT.
AND EVEN IF THEY HAD ACCESSED
IT, IT WOULDN'T GO TO THE
REGIME, IT WOULD GO TO APPROVED
VENDORS THAT WE APPROVED TO GO
BUY FOOD, MEDICINE, AND MEDICAL
EQUIPMENT, AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTS, AND SHIP IT INTO IRAN
DIRECTLY TO THE BENEFIT OF THE
IRANIAN PEOPLE.
>> Reporter: AND, KATY, YOU
KNOW, IMPORTANT TO NOTE AMIDST
ALL OF THAT CHATTER ABOUT THAT 6
BILLION, AND THAT WAS PART OF
THE GUARANTEE FOR THOSE HOSTAGES
LAST MONTH THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE
IS NO REAL PROOF THAT IRAN WAS
REALLY BEHIND THIS ATTACK ON
SATURDAY.
NOW, WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT IRAN
BACKS HAMAS, AND HEZBOLLAH AND
GIVES THEM QUITE A BIT OF MONEY.
THERE WAS ONE REPORT IN THE
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" A COUPLE
OF DAYS AGO THAT SAID THAT IRAN
HELPED PLAN AND ACTUALLY GREEN
LIT THE OPERATION.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE ACTUAL REALLY
PUTTING THEIR FINGER PRINTS ON
IT, REALLY BEING INVOLVED IN THE
MINUTIAE OF THE OPERATION, THAT
WAS WHAT THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL" WAS SAYING.
