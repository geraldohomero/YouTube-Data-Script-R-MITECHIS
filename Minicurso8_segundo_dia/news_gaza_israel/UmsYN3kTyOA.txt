 
>> THEY KEEP DIGGING. SCOTT 
McFARLANE, THANK YOU. 
>>> PRESIDENT BIDEN IS SET TO 
ADDRESS THE NATION TONIGHT 
ABOUT THE US RESPONSE TO THE 
WARS IN ISRAEL AND UKRAINE. 
HE IS PREPARED TO ASK US FOR 
ABOUT $100 BILLION OVER THE 
NEXT YEAR AS A SUPPLEMENTAL. 
JOINING US NOW, CBS SENIOR 
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, WEIJIA 
JIANG.  
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR 
CONGRESS? 
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT 
WANTS TO MAKE A DIRECT APPEAL, 
NOT ONLY TO LAWMAKERS, BUT TO 
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, TO STRESS 
THAT THIS FUNDING IS NOT ONLY 
ABOUT SUPPORTING ISRAEL AND 
UKRAINE, BUT IT IS A MATTER OF 
NATIONAL SECURITY. 
AND SO HE WILL REALLY TRY TO 
HAMMER HOME THE MESSAGE OF, 
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE AIDE STOPS 
FLOWING, AND HOW THAT COULD 
HARM AMERICANS, AND WHY PEOPLE 
SHOULD BE PUSHING, AND SHOULD 
BE CALLING UP THEIR LAWMAKERS 
IN GETTING INVOLVED IN BEING 
ENGAGED IN THIS, BECAUSE HE 
WILL SAY IT'S A VERY DELICATE 
MATTER FOR PEOPLE HERE AT HOME 
AS WELL. 
BUT, AS YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT, REQUESTING 
FUNDING IS ONE THING. 
GETTING IT APPROVED REQUIRES A 
FUNCTIONING CONGRESS, WHICH WE 
DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW. 
I ASKED SOURCES WHETHER HE 
PLANNED TO MENTION OR ALLUDE TO 
THE CHAOS ON CAPITOL HILL. 
AND THEY AREN'T EXPECTING THAT, 
BUT CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE 
READING BETWEEN THE LINES, AND 
TALKING ABOUT HOW CRITICAL THIS 
FUNDING IS. 
>> IN TERMS OF THE TOP LINES, 
WHAT HAS THE WHITE HOUSE 
REVEALED ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THE 
$100 BILLION WOULD GO TOWARD 
ISRAEL AND HOW MUCH WOULD GO 
TOWARD UKRAINE? 
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT THE 
DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDING? 
>> Reporter: SOURCES CLOSE TO 
THE FUNDING REQUEST HAVE TOLD 
ME THAT ABOUT $60 BILLION WOULD 
GO TO UKRAINE FUNDING. 
AT LEAST $10 BILLION, TO ISRAEL
, WHICH IS THE NUMBER THAT THE 
COUNTRY REQUESTED. 
AND THEN, THE OTHER REMAINING 
$30 MILLION BILLION WOULD BE 
SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRIES AND 
THE INDO-PACIFIC. 
A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF FUNDS 
ARE EXPECTED TO GO TO THE 
PENTAGON TO REPLENISH ALL THE 
STOCKPILES THAT HAVE BEEN 
ESSENTIALLY DRAINED, BECAUSE OF 
ALL THE AID THAT THE US HAS 
BEEN PROVIDING TO UKRAINE. 
SO, SOURCES HAVE ALSO STRESSED 
NOTHING IS FINAL YET, BECAUSE 
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY MORE WORK TO 
DO WHEN YOU GET DOWN AND DIRTY 
INTO, YOU KNOW, LINE BY LINE 
FIGURES HERE. THAT'S WHAT'S 
BECOMING APPARENT AS OF NOW
