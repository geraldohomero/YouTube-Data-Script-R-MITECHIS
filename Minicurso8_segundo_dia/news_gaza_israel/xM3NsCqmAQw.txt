Today a bad day for the market and its
One reason for the weekend that came from outside
Development took place between Israel and Hamas
Because of the war that erupted and crude oil
Then I am a very tremendous bounce and market
In these generals, complete a risk off
This was seen in global markets and
See you today in the Indian market today
Although the market got once
Must try a support from lower level
A recovery also came to take but that
Recovery failed and then market
Slip again, though 19500 on the go
We defended for once but
Today was a big problem of a bank
Nifty which was down to about 1 and midcap
Index that below 1/5 and advanced
Dicline closed at around 1: 4
The only pocket that remained a little
Although profit booking also came there
IT was on higher levels where still
Today you can say that out
Performance although the index of IT
Also closed in raid but still as much
Did not fall as much as all the inshes fell
The most fell in the stock index today
Adani Ports with a direct Israel
Play is a port in Israel and
The big port is this stock down at around 5
Apart from that there was a decline in auto stocks
M M&M BPCL because crude
SBI Kotak increased the price
Mahindrafinance.com gave a little bit
Perform out as far as FAO
There you saw a big impact GMR
Airports
A Adani Ports Aditya Birla Capital Aarti
Industries Inter Globe Aviation Sunti Bandhan
Banks in stocks from around three
6 were down at 6 and if you talk about stocks
Do where there were some genses in them
Delta Cop and Metropolis included now
What to do, I think see two-three days
Take the market that it collects it
Not doing if not collecting
If it is always a normal war, always stocks
Recover this always and mine
It is to be believed that this time it will happen but
Wait and speech once the next three-four days
Take
