I've just come back from Qatar and
everywhere I went from inside World Cup
stadiums to public markets and streets
people were carrying the Palestinian
flag
its prominence has surprised a lot of
people and it tells us something really
interesting about the Arab world
a few years ago a bunch of Arab
governments signed normalization
agreements with Israel they agreed to
recognize Israel's existence to set up
embassies start trading and openly

signed these Agreements are real
democracies their people were never
consulted on whether they wanted to make
deals with a country that's been
illegally occupying Palestinian land for
more than 50 years
and we've never really had a sense of
what Arab populations think of these
agreements until this month
the world cup is one of the few
occasions where people from Arab
countries have been able to gather and
express themselves politically
and while Qatar has frowned on protests
promoting the rights of gay and queer
people
it's had no problem with people pushing
the Palestinian cause Palestinians
solidarity it's coming not just from the
Arabs it's coming from foreign

and so fans and teams have used the
tournament to send a message that even
though their governments now enjoy
decent relations with Israel
that doesn't reflect what everyone in
those countries thinks
for Palestinians this solidarity is a
reminder that even though their cause is
struggling they still have sympathy
across the Arab world
and for Arab governments it's a sign
that even though they're ready to push
the Palestinian cause down their list of
priorities their people are not
