week
the embattled prime minister of israel
is now reluctant to forego his official
residence
and this has forced the new prime
minister naftali bennett
to ask netanyahu to leave naftali
bennett has conveyed to netanyahu that
he needs to leave within 14 days
as netanyahu clings on to the official
residence of the prime minister of
israel
the coalition government plans to
introduce a legislation
regulating the changeover at the
official residence for the future
however the former prime minister of
israel remains undeterred and
might not depart for several more weeks
according to local media reports the
netanyahus have started packing and the
vacating process will take a few more
weeks
meanwhile for the time being bennett
even after six days of his swearing in
ceremony is living in his family home
in ranana the issue of the former prime
minister residing at the official
residence has already sparked an uproar
let's look at what exactly happened
netanyahu held a meeting at his
residence
on the 14th of june with the u.s
ambassador to the united nations nikki
haley
haley posted a photograph of herself on
twitter
with netanyahu and christians united for
israel founder
john hagee people immediately started
asking why an opposition leader
continuing to use the official prime
minister's residence
has to host foreign dignitaries the
uproar led to an
anti-netanyahu protest group threatening
to move the high court against the
former
prime minister for the same they sent a
letter to the prime minister's office
criticizing netanyahu for remaining at
the public resource
the letter notes that this is not the
first time netanyahu is doing this
previously as well it took the netanyahu
family six weeks to vacate the residence
the previous time the liquid leader was
voted out this was in 1999.
experts believe that netanyahu is taking
advantage of the no
legal stipulation regarding when a
replaced premier must leave the official
residence
they claim that this is one of his
tactics to cling on to power
in the capital city of israel
