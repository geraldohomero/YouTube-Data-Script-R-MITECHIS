THAT SOME CONSUMERS ARE
WELCOMING THE MOVE TONIGHT.
SCOTT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
KARMA.
>> NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD,
INCLUDING CANADA, HAVE STRONGLY
CONDEMNED RUSSIA'S UNPROVOKED
ATTACK ON UKRAINE AND LEVELLED
INCREASINGLY HARSH SANCTIONS.
BUT AS CTV'S BEN MILJURE
REPORTS, SOME COUNTRIES ARE
TRYING TO REMAIN NEUTRAL AS
OTHERS ARE ACCUSED OF THROWING
RUSSIA A LIFELINE.
>> AS THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
CAUSED BY RUSSIA'S ATTACK ON
UKRAINE GROWS. SO DOES OUTRAGE
FROM THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY WHICH IS RETALIATING
WITH HARSH ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.
>> WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE'RE SUFFOCATING THE RUSSIAN

DID THE U.S. EVER THINK ABOUT
THE CONSEQUENCE OF PUSHING A
BIG COUNTRY TO THE WALL?
SHE WROTE THE SANCTIONS ARE
NOT AS EFFECTIVE. RUSSIA STILL
HAS AN OUTLET FOR TRADE.
IF CHINA IS ABLE TO MEET THOSE
DEMANDS BOTH IN REGARDS TO
IMPORTANT EXPORT.
>> THEY COULD SUCCESSFULLY
UNDERCUT THE IMPACT. THE
SANCTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE.
>> AZERBAIJAN AND KAZAKHSTAN
HAVE TRIED TO REMAIN NEUTRAL.
WELL, ANOTHER FORMER SOVIET
STATE BELARUS HAS BEEN ANYTHING
BUT ALLOWING RUSSIA TO LAUNCH
PART OF THE INVASION FROM ITS
TERRITORY.
>> RIGHT NOW AND PEOPLE ARE
PUTTING QUITE DIRECTLY. SO THAT
