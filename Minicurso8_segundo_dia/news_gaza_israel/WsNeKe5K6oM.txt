The siege on gauze does not give truce the
lack of fuel that keeps without
energy to hospitals could now
Cause a collapse in the water system
Drinking and the waters
residual at this time has been exhausted
All the diesel stock of the
municipalities and in the event that they stop
The wells and there are no diesel urgently
We are facing the tragedy of death
for thirst for the entire population of 2.3
millions of people in the strip of
gaza the total cessation of water pumps
residuals causes addressing in
streets and neighborhoods creating an abomination
health and environmental and propagation
of
diseases are more and more
orders for humanitarian aid to
increase and the Palestinian authorities
They refuse to create fields
temporary for those displaced to the same
Time ask for more runners
Humanitarians I call on
United Nations and the European Union
to send help from the air to the
Gaza strip especially north
as has happened in several experiences
In the world we ask them to open
Help corridors towards Gaza and I don't know
Limit to the Rafa area we reject the
TEMPORARY CAMPUS ESTABLISHMENT
For displaced people as requested by the
Israeli army to organizations
International we want us to
people return to their homes from where
Were displaced by the
strength the situation of hospitals
It is still dramatic in Al Shifa
They need the creation of a corridor
insurance to evacuate about 600 patients
civilians who have been
surrounded by crossfire the
Shifa hospital the greatest of
Gaza is still not working
is at the gates of the enclosure where
He says he ever hides and the deceased
increase the Ministry of Health of
Gaza even talks about premature babies and
Other patients who lost their lives
Due to lack of resources
