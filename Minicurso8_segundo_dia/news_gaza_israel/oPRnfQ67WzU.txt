6 months ago Amira couldn't
formulate a sentence when it was
Transferred from Gaza to Augusta Hospital
Victoria of Jerusalem the tumor in her
brain threatened its
life today physically she goes
much better but the little one is
now terrified at the idea of being a
day returned to
[Music]
Gaza
Doctor Salamie tries to console her
Yet she knows that the authorities
Israeli constitute a list that
Passions referred to Gaza despite the
war that is currently making
minus 20 people are affected Amira
She is not on the list but
anxiety mixes with sorrows his dreams
his bed his things everything has gone in
dust she loves her a lot
tradition is livor the house abounded
memories and there is nothing left of everything
that and of course his sister missing
And all the rest of the
Family in the same Hamza 4 year old room
and a half is also sick with cancer
of the brain the doctor confessed to Gaza he
would not have had any chance of survival even
Before the 7th
October before the war there was
only one hospital with which we
collaborated in the hospital returned here if a
child was diagnosed with a tumor
He was transferred to us but
Today it is impossible that he
returns to Gaza since there is no
chimtherapy no more vital care for
A patient from
cancer then to protect these patients
Gazaoui The hospital has long refused to
communicate their state of health to
Authorities then at the end of March the NGO
Israeli Physicians for Human Rights
filed an appeal to the Supreme Court he
there is no justification no law
which allows you to return patients
in a war zone it is not
only illegal also inhuman our
asks is to keep them until this
that there is a lasting fire in
await some patients deceive
Ennit in the streets of Jerusalem is
It is the Palestinian authority that pays
for their hotel but since they are in
remission the government considers that
This is enough to be returned to Gaza
Yes it's true but it should not be
forget that there is also a follow -up with
Doctors on Friday I had a
Meet with my
specialist for these men waiting
will last several weeks the
Israeli government will have to present
his arguments at the Supreme Court in April
which will then rule on the fate of
his
passions
