he could become dan you know almost like
a shadow president you know he's not
really the president anymore but he's
got twitter
he's got tens of millions of followers
he's got money he can hold rallies
and he just sort of you know continues
to go after the fact that in his mind
anyway
this election was was stolen from him
it's a really good point
and when you think about richard nixon
even nixon went quietly after
he left office in 1974
you know he gave some speeches but he
was pretty quiet almost every president
stays silent you think back jimmy carter
critiqued george w bush's administration
and people were
worried that he was speaking out of turn
there's a real tradition but as you said
there's just no chance that he will
abide by it
in my view he won't even show up and do
a lot of the ceremonial things we expect
during a presidential transition that
includes inviting the president-elect
and attending inauguration yeah so in
other words you know
the whole transition of power they could
just choose to uh
you know to use an expression kind of
take their marbles and go home
well it's not just taking the marbles
and going home it's throwing marbles uh
as
you may recall there were charges that
clinton staffers remove
w keys from keyboards
i think we're thinking about a lot worse
here when you think about the damage
that could be done during a transition
not just firing people but destroying
records
and beyond so i think there will be
actually a lot of litigation
and efforts to watch the trump
administration closely over these next
few months
and one last thing before you go i mean
when you hear the president say
i'm going to take this all the way to
the supreme court itself
well he didn't go to law school
cases do not begin in the supreme court
and i also think that
a majority of the justices don't want to
be seen
as his puppets so uh i think the the
the odds are very long perhaps in
pennsylvania it would be
count it would be about counting votes
that arrived
after election day but i think the
margin there is safe enough
that the court would not even want to
hear it
thanks for this dan great to have you
with us and getting your insights
