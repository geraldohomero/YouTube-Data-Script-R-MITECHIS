E
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION.  
WHAT IS THE LATEST?    
>> Reporter: THIS IS A STATEMENT
FROM THE OFFICE OF THE ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER, BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU, CONFIRMING THAT
ISRAEL WILL ALLOW EIGHT TO TWO
ENTERED THE GAZA STRIP FROM
EGYPT AT THE RAFAH CROSSING IN
THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE GAZA
STRIP, AS LONG AS FOOD AND
WATER, AND HE IS SPECIFYING,
ONLY ESSENTIAL HUMANITARIAN AID
DOES NOT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF
HAMAS.  
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT IN THE
CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE
U.S. PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN
BECAUSE, AS YOU MENTIONED, THE
SUMMIT THAT WAS MUCH
ANTICIPATED, BILLED AS SOMETHING
THAT WOULD DAMPEN DOWN THE
TENSIONS IN THE REGION, WAS
COUNSELED.  
IT WAS CANCELLED BY JORDAN AND
EGYPT, AS WELL AS THE
PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT.  
GORDON AND EGYPT ARE BOTH
COUNTRIES TO HAVE PEACE
AGREEMENTS WITH ISRAEL.  
VERY SIGNIFICANT AND A
REFLECTION OF THOSE COUNTRIES
UNDER PRESSURE FROM THEIR
POPULATION OVER THE ANGER THAT
PEOPLE FEEL NOT JUST ABOUT THIS
EXPLOSION OF THE HOSPITAL, WHICH
MANY PEOPLE IN THE PALESTINIAN
STREETS CERTAINLY FLEW BLAME ON
ISRAEL, BUT FOR THE PAIN AND
SUFFERING THAT THEY HAVE SEEN
GOING ON IN THE GAZA STRIP UNDER
THE ISRAELI BOMBARDMENT SO FAR. 
MANY IN THE ARAB WORLD ARE
SUSPICIOUS OF THE UNITED STATES.
THEY HAVE LONG SAID THAT
WASHINGTON'S UNPRECEDENTED AND
UNRESERVED SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL
DISQUALIFIES IT BACK IF YOU
LIKE, FROM BEING AN HONEST
BROKER IN THIS VERY LONG,
DECADES OLD CONFLICT.  
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE
HUMANITARIAN AID WILL AT LEAST
ALLOW THE U.S. TO COME AWAY
SAYING HAS DONE SOMETHING OR THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  
HE ALSO SAID TO THE ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER THAT IT WAS
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT HAMAS
DOES NOT REPRESENT ALL THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  
HE SAID HAMAS HAS ESSENTIALLY
BROUGHT MISERY TO THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  
A LITTLE BIT OF A SUCCESS FOR
JOE BIDEN AND CERTAINLY IF THAT
