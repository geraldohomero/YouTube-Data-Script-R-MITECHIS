more precise in New York where
carried out the first
Manifestations of 2024 Pro Palestinas
asking for a stop to the fire at
hostilities that in recent months
of 2023 were carried out where lives
They were charged and destruction for
Important infrastructure assumption
In Palestine we can now see how
These people gathered there in the
last hours of the 2 and the first of the
2024 in these manifestations in the
New York City in support of
Palestinians while the conflict between
Israel and the terrorist group ever

Palestinian flags we can observe
posters and even balloons asking for a
Free Palestine observes there that the
Free Palestine Gaza All these are the
messages were leaving not oer
This did not start on October 7 and that is
A reality huh to understand what
Go with them you have to take a look
giant and orgar in the past as a
practical exercise to understand what is

to Israel in this war but if you
also dare to take a look at the

declared objective of the army of
Israel we have already told you

Palestinian militant who launched that assault
cross -border very premeditated surprise
against Israeli cities on
October killing 14 people in their
most civilians and taking 240 hostages of

released but not all and many of
They under infrahuman conditions
Israeli aircraft intensified the
Attacks there in Center of Gaza
While the battles were fought between
The rubble of cities and fields of
refugees
