Mr President
Joe I want to thank you for coming here
today your visit here is the first visit
of an American president in Israel at a
time of War it is deeply deeply moving
the the fear and the Panic of those
little children in their last
moments but there's a lot of people out
there and I not sure so we got a lot we
got to overcome a lot you know um
Americans are grieving with you they
really are and we have to also bear in
mind that AAS does not represent all the
Palestinian
people and uh it has brought them only
suffering I was deeply saddened and
outraged by the uh explosion at the
hospital in Gaza yesterday and based on
what I've seen it appears as though it
was done by the other team not not you
Mr President you rightly said that Hamas
is worse than Isis the German chancellor
who visited here yesterday said that
Hamas were the new Nazis you're both
right and just as a civilized World
United to defeat the Nazis and United to
defeat Isis the Civilized world must
unite to defeat Kamas from breaking news
