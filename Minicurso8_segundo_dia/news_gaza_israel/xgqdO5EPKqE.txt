Rafa is a known beach community
for their bars and restaurants of
Hummus but now the police have put
night closures while
Officers with assault rifles patrol
the streets the police try to stop the
violence that has exploded in Jaffa and in
Every Israel between the Jewish majority and the
Arabs that constitute a minority of
20 percent the synagogues mosques
cemeteries a theater restaurants and
cars have been attacked to my friend
They burned his car last night without reason
I was parked at home is a
Jungla White Franklin which is enough
scary to live here but still
We just bought some things in the
Supermarket
I feel safe but not 100% by safe

Despite the recent hostility
tensions in Jaffa have been
Gesting for quite some time
Poor Arabs are expelled from their
social homes to be replaced
For luxurious apartments the family
Harboe who has lived in Jaffa all his
Life Libra since 2018 a fight with the
Public housing administrator
social to look that tries to evict
The things became violent
day and the children of TAV assaulted the
men who took photos of the
property and were arrested
The people here are exploiting them
People began to attack their homes
is exploiting cannot endure one
of us could be sitting in your
house and they would come and take it out in
Aha they took everyone to look at
I take people
It is by definition an Arab city
There is definitely Arab population here
And it is welcome but the Jewish community
Here is prosperous and has been a community
Jew for many years the Jewish community
needed to strengthen and it was the place
Perfect to do it
After seven decades of control
Israeli Jaffa's Arabs usually
Speak Arab dotted with Hebrew and
Often they study and work at the
Israeli Jewish society however
growing life costs and pressure
to look are feeding the fears
that the Arabs are expelled from the
city that reinforces its solidarity with
The Palestinians in Jerusalem and Gaza but
tense in the fragile social fabric of your
own neighborhood
