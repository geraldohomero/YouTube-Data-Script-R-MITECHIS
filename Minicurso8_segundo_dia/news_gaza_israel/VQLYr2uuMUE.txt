Palestinian Islamist group Hamas rampaged through 
Israeli towns on Saturday (October 7) killing and  
capturing scores of civilians and soldiers 
in their biggest surprise attack in decades.
The group distributed these videos Saturday inside 
an Israeli military camp near the border of Gaza.
Reuters couldn’t immediately verify 
the videos which display what is said  
to be bodies of Israeli soldiers 
brought into Gaza by fighters.
Israel then responded with massive air 
strikes deep inside the coastal enclave  
that led to the collapse of buildings 
and vowed unprecedented retaliation.
During a security cabinet meeting, Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said,
“Since this morning the state of Israel 
has been at war. Our first objective is to  
clear out enemy forces that infiltrated 
and restore the security and quiet to  
the communities that have been attacked. 
The second objective, at the same time,  
is to exact an immense price from the 
enemy, within the Gaza Strip too.”
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the assault that  
had begun in Gaza would spread 
to the West Bank and Jerusalem.
"This was the morning of defeat 
and humiliation upon our enemy,  
its soldiers and its settlers" he said, 
adding, “what happened reveals the  
greatness of our preparation. What happened 
today reveals the weakness of the enemy."
In southern Israel near Gaza, bullet holes 
filled the windshield of a car as bodies were  
found nearby - while rockets lit up the night 
sky as fighting progressed into the night.
Hamas said it fired 150 of them 
toward Tel Aviv in retaliation  
for the Israeli strike that took down a building.
