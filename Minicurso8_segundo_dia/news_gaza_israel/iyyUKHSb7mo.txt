MAINTAIN ORDER IN GAZA AND
PROBABLY THE WEST BANK, ALSO.
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE
FACING THE UNITED STATES.
>> THAT AS WE APPROACH THE
THREE-MONTH MARK OF ALL OF THIS
GOING ON.
MONICA, I WANTED TO ASK YOU
ABOUT THE BREAKING NEWS FROM
ISRAEL, THE SUPREME COURT
STRIKING DOWN THE KEY PART OF
NETANYAHU'S CONTROVERSIAL
JUDICIAL OVERHAULS.
IS THERE CONCERN FROM THE U.S.
THAT THIS COULD IGNITE TENSIONS
THERE, POTENTIALLY WEAKEN
NETANYAHU IN ALL THIS?
JUST TO REMIND PEOPLE, THE HUGE
PROTESTS WE SAW, MOST OF THE
HEADLINES OUT OF ISRAEL BEFORE
OCTOBER 7th WERE ABOUT THESE
HUGE PROTESTS AND THE UNREST WE
SAW THERE.
>> Reporter: MASS PROTESTS
STEPHEN.
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT AT THE
TIME THE U.S. HAD BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT IN TERMS OF DESTABILIZING
THE COUNTRY.
MUCH OF THAT WAS PUT ASIDE, AS
YOU MENTIONED, AFTER OCTOBER 7th
AND THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN
ISRAEL.
SO WHAT WE SAW IN TERMS OF THE
DISRUPTION, AND IN ALL OF THOSE
MASS PROTESTS AND THAT
EXPRESSION REALLY HAD BEEN PUT
TO THE SIDE.
NOW WITH THIS RULING THERE IS A
RENEWED FEAR THAT THAT COULD
COME BACK UP.
THIS IS A VERY DIVISIVE ISSUE.
CERTAINLY PRIME MINISTER
NETANYAHU HAS STAKED HIS
POLITICAL CAPITAL ON.
THERE'S ALWAYS FROM THE U.S.
PERSPECTIVE THIS QUESTION ABOUT
WHO IS LEADING ISRAEL AND HOW
THE UNITED STATES CAN WORK WITH
THEM.
AFTER THOSE ATTACKS AND, OF
COURSE, AFTER HAMAS MURDERED
THOSE ISRAELIS, INCLUDING
AMERICANS AND OTHER FOREIGN
NATIONALS, THE PRIORITY WAS TO
MAKE SURE THAT THE U.S. WAS
CONTINUING TO SUPPORT ISRAEL.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN STEADFAST
IN THAT EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BEEN
CLEAR IN RECENT WEEKS, HE HAD
SERIOUS DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE
PRIME MINISTER AND EVEN THOSE
COMMENTS RECENTLY ABOUT THE,
QUOTE, INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING
THAT ISRAEL HAS DONE.
