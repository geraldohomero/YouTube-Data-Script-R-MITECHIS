What do we know at this stage?
Well, it's still still really the first
hour here of these reports coming in.
We have, as you mentioned, two U.S.
officials confirming that Israel
launched a missile strike on western
Iran.
We have seen multiple unverified reports
of explosions taking place around the
region.
There's some thought that this these may
be drones as well getting hit.
We just don't know that much.
Esfahan, as you mentioned, is the site
where there was a report of an
explosion.
That is also a city known for having a
number of military bases and facilities.
It's believed to be one of the places
that Iran launched its April 13th attack
on Israel from.
So it would seem to be a natural target.
But in terms of what has actually been
hit, whether there are any casualties,
those details have really not come in
yet.
We're just trying to find out the scope
of what appears to be taking place,
possibly still taking place as we speak.
That's right.
I mean, it's been a decades long shadow
war.
The concern really is now that war is
coming out to the open.
I mean, what are the risks of that?
What are people saying right now?
Well, there had been a lot of pressure
coming on.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu after Iran's barrage of drones
and missiles last weekend to have Israel
not really respond or not respond in
force.
Netanyahu and other top officials said
that they had to respond in some way.
It's really the nature of that response
that people are going to be looking at
very carefully.
There will be a big difference, I think,
between striking and destroying a runway
at a military base versus hitting a
barracks full of troops or anything like
that.
So it's too it's really too soon to know
the extent and the damage caused.
But those are the kind of things I think
people will be looking at to see.
Does this, in fact, really amount to a
significant escalation?
Tensions are already quite high given
all everything else going on in that
region.
And no one has an interest in seeing a
much broader war break out between Iran
and Israel.
