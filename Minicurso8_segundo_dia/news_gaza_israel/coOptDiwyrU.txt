we've seen Israel's hostages coming home
in a blaze of coverage but not
Palestinian prisoners returning to East
Jerusalem as part of the truce oh we
come to speak to the family of the
prisoners not now the Israeli police
won't allow we need the taxi though to
get to get home I don't think so so can
please the Israelis have banned
Palestinians from celebrating the
homecoming of their prisoners and
they're threatening them with Hefty
fines if they do so we've just tried to
to talk to the families of some of them
coming home tonight but we've been moved
back here by the police we tried another
home filming from a
distance once police have moved on we
found the Abram family welcoming back
their 17-year-old son who'd been held
for a year without conviction for
throwing stones well prison was
humiliating and they came in and beat us
ever since the War Began and we were
treated like
dogs
it's a gift from God it's as if it's
Miracle the longest serving prisoner to
be released so far is sharuk dwat
convicted 8 years ago for allegedly
stabbing two
Israelis sharuk is back now with her
family in East Jerusalem she says she'll
train to be a lawyer to help those left
in jail though she's worried the
Israelis might come for her
again my biggest fear is to be arrested
again because they've already threatened
me with that and it's possible that the
house could be invaded at any
moment on the West Bank beyond the reach
of Israeli police prisoners were
welcomed by huge crowds again the green
colors of Hamas hoist around them with
the flags of other Palestinian
factions in Gaza Aid PED in for a third
day of
Ceasar ammed showed our team the
supplies he' picked up but says the war
has made life much much
harder my wife is ill she needs to have
nappies in his fed by feeding tube she
needs medications and I don't have any
money to buy them the situation is
difficult there are no toilets no
running water and no
electricity the guns may be silent for
now in Gaza but not on the West
Bank eight Palestinians were killed in
clashes there in the last 24 hours the
fears of the situation there escalating
further when the war in Gaza resumed
