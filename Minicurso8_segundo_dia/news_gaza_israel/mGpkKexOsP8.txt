Yes we can already talk I think of a
success in terms of participation
Thousands of people walk at
through the capital the heart of Paris
Behind me the rue du Temple which leads
At the Jewish Art and History Museum
And this procession started from the Institute of
Arab world is therefore a whole symbol
a sort of gateway between
two cultures between two peoples it was
the goal of the organizers who want
going beyond divisions is a call to
Peace to the Union you have not said it
political slogan and uh it's a it's
A walk that will therefore go to this
direction with many
personalities from the world of culture we
saw Emmanuel BÃ©ard uh but also Joy
Star and Isabella Adani with whom we were able
TO TO IS I offer you everything to
Continuation of listening to actress Isabella
Adani the mobilization of artists me
I find that it is something
very French uh I would like to know
In which other country at the moment to
the stranger the white march and uh
neutral and uh and neutral does not mean
disengaged is currently taking place huh here
We are there for peace here uh and
even in the United States uh artists who
take position do it for a camp
For another we do it for all
Human beings who must remain
humans we will go towards walking we
[Music]
go
We obviously have this walk
who will end soon and who will go
Direction Ars and Trade this march which
was at the initiative of a Belgian actress
of Moroccan origin who said wanted
want to go beyond divisions in a
very complicated context she talks about a
fratricidal war between Palestinians and
Israeli and she calls like the
Other people here he is the fire
immediate and peace thank you very much
Plovis for all these details since
Parisian march
