coming down heavily on the United States
Iran has said that the US can't go back
on an agreement to transfer $6 billion
in Frozen funds through mediator katar
following hamas's deadly attack on
Israelis last week US Secretary of State
Anthony blinkin issued a waiver to
International Banks to allow the
transfer of $6 billion in Frozen Iranian
funds to Qatar from South Korea
it said that Iran will be allowed to use
these funds to buy food medicine and
other humanitarian items and also
committed to release five Iranian
Nationals currently detained in the
United States as a part of a prisoner
exchange deal with Iran now this was
notified to the US Congress on the 11th
of
September however since Hamas militants
stormed across Israel's Southern border
line last weekend Iran has come under
intense Global
scrutiny while it has insisted it was
not involved in the attack its people
celebrated the Hamas attack as a success
back in the United States Biden's rival
Donald Trump has stepped up his election
campaign slamming Biden for agreeing to
pay for hostages he said the American
dollars helped pay for the recent
attacks on Israel IES by
Hamas according to reports the US has
reached an understanding with Qatar not
to release any of the $6 billion in
Iranian oil revenues that was unfrozen
as a part of the prisoner swap last
month so uh we did see uh photographs
videos that the U Israeli government
shared with
us uh some I think is actually already
been seen uh in um uh public media uh
others were were new to me and I think
uh new to our
team it's hard to find the right
words
it's beyond what anyone would ever want
to imagine much less actually see and
God forbid
experience a baby an infant
riddled with
bullets soldiers
beheaded young people burned
alive in their
cars or in their Hiway
rooms I could go
on
but it's
simply depravity in the worst imaginable
way aliim magam spokesperson of Iran's
permanent mission to the United Nations
said the US government knows that it
cannot reneg on the prisoner swap
agreement he said that the money
rightfully belongs to the people of Iran
earmarked for the government of the
Islamic Republic of Iran to facilitate
the acquisition of all essential
requisites for the
Iranians
