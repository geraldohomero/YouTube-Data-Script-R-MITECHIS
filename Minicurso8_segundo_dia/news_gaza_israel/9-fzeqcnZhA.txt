U.S President Joe Biden has urged
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to abandon the judicial
overhaul which sparked massive protests
for more than three months now in
response Netanyahu has said that
Israel's decisions are not based on
pressures from abroad
well I don't know the Reflection Point
but I think it's a difficult spot to be
in and they got to work it out so what
do you hope the Prime Minister will do
on that particular law
I hope we uh
as we walk away from
after weeks of protests on Monday prime
minister Netanyahu announced that the
judicial reform bills will be paused but
after Biden's statement that Netanyahu
should walk away from the bills the
Israeli Prime Minister was quick to
respond
Netanyahu said to Joe Biden that Israel
is a sovereign country which makes its
Decisions by the will of its people and
not based on pressures from abroad
including from the best of friends
now Nathaniel also tell the Israel U.S
Alliance as quote unquote unbreakable he
said that the ties always overcomes the
occasional disagreements
the judicial overhaul proposed by the
Israeli government sparked massive
protests across the country the overall
would give the Israeli government
greater control over appointments to the
country's Supreme Court
citizens have been protesting the
overhaul on the streets for over 11
weeks now
to decode this development further we
spoke to Oren Kessler he is a journalist
and political analyst from Tel Aviv
this is a fairly unprecedented certainly
in recent years for a U.S Administration
a U.S president indeed to so explicitly
and even repeatedly
take issue or diverge with an Israeli
internal matter
um
usually until now over the past few
months throughout this whole judicial
overhaul campaign here in Israel the U.S
Administration has been quite cautious
in uh making clear that okay this is
Israel is a sovereign country these are
internal matters for Israel and we uh
we're watching closely and we hope that
they can reach an agreement but now
President Biden said on multiple
occasions uh that he uh hopes that the
Netanyahu government here will uh take a
step back which will reach a genuine
compromise with the opposition and even
that it will essentially uh set aside
these dramatic overhauls to the judicial
to the judicial system that the
government is planning
