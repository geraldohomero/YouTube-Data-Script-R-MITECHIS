Gaza Strip children with pots and pans
await their only hot meal of the
day for many this soup may be the only
nourishment they get until
tomorrow the vast majority of displaced
Palestinians have moved here from across
Gaza over the past 4 months based on the
evacuation orders of Israeli forces
there are well over a million people
many of them living in encampments now

troops will move into the City
previously designated a safe Zone it is
impossible to achieve the war goal of
eliminating Hamas and leave four Hamas
battalions in Rafa Benjamin Netanyahu
said in a statement on the other hand it
is clear that a massive operation in
rafah requires the evacuation of the
civilian population from the combat
zones he added the UN says the density
of Rafa's population makes it nearly
impossible to protect civilians we are
extremely worried about the fate of
civilians uh in in Rafa so would
that constitute a violation I mean
forced displacement that
is I mean for we would not support in
any way forced uh displacement which
goes against uh international law on the
ground anxiety and panic
spread we are afraid we are worried sick
from Fear where will we go to where I
don't want to migrate I want to die on

begun air strikes in RAF targeting two
residential buildings on Friday killing
