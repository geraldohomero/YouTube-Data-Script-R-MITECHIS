Israel in the feeling of family and comrades
The coffin covered with the flag slowly into the ground
Going down Hamas's surprise attack
Israeli soldier Itai who was killed while fighting
Mr. Mia's last
It is the way
To heal the pain of spending my brother first
The reserve forces for emergency rescuers
Ahead of joining
There is a husband who is an Israeli husband
The memories of traveling to Korea with my brother
Bomi, who was kept, was worried about sadness
I'm ahead, but I try to make my heart
Husband is in the reserve army
The reason is for the country and I
I think there is no choice but to cheer
After all, for 30 years as a multicultural family
Sukyung, who lives in Israel, can't sleep
Send Nana to achieve
There is already a son -in -law.
As the war intensifies, the only daughter
Can be convened as a reserve army
That's because the war is more
If it gets worse, you will probably call it as a reserve army
The same
So, Israel's Korean Multicultural Culture
More than 30 families
Like the furniture, the family relatives
To be on the battlefield or before the war
Estimated
Husbands, children and grandchildren are here
And my parents -in -law
so
Uh I will never go alone
It's the same, in Israel, including Dana's family
The remaining Koreans
Comforting and in Israel and the Korean government
Sharing the ball SNS to convey safety
Confirm
There is a variety of situations
To strengthen communication
Scheduled to be a little in Korean citizens
What is the necessary matters
A little meeting to talk
Signing
Israel's precious assumptions
It is achieved and sometimes in Korea
It has also played a role
The war between the symptoms of Koreans and the tragedy
After the end of the local society and the peace of the local society
I hope that everyday will come back
There is an Anwol in Jerusalem, Israel
This is silk
