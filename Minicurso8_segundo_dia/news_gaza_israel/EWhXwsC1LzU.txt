the streets of about 100 cities of
Spain have been filled with flags
Palestinas and thousands of people who
They ask for the cessation of hostilities after
almost 5 months of war in which they have
who died almost 30,000 Palestinians and 100
Israelis but protests go more
there and have a direct message to
Spanish government for war and for
that they stop exporting or importing any
type of armament because really
that people are now suffering from
Gaza is a total genocide that is
selling Spain the state of Israel
They can be against the population eh
also our own legislation
He says that weapons cannot be sold to a
State that commits crimes against
Humanity as Israel does for 75
years although the government has
suspended any export of
Weapons since October 7 in November
of 2023 ammunition to Israel were sent by
value of almost one million euros a
shipping
Before the beginning of the war for that
Communities Associations
Palestinas in Spain have started
procedures so that all the
current authorizations of trade of
Defense material with Israel the
Palestinian activism in Spain has
much roots not only from the offensive
from Israel after the attacks of ever on 7

what is being committed against this
people over decades are not
very nice to see how another
Palestine that people not only from Palestinian
The Arab world of the Spanish world
They also feel they have to fight
For the people in Palestin and Gaza
now also support from the government of
Spain that has been explicit in its
called to Israel to cease the attacks
also announced a new contribution of
3 and a half million to the agency of the
UN for Palestinian refugees after
accusations that some of their
employees had participated in the
Massacre of October 7 and has assured
In addition, it will impose sanctions on
settlers if they do not remember at the level
