During his press conference
weekly every Saturday evening
Now Benjamin Netanahou has reaffirmed
his desire to go to the end if we
let's stop before rafar, that is to say that
We will have lost the war said
Benjamin Netaniaahou so there is a
break in these operations
since the Israelis are waiting for the
Palestinian civilians who are you have it
Said extremely numerous probably
more than a million arafar and well who
the area evacuated they are pressure for
that Egypt can at least open
refugee camps on the border with
Rafar and then he also leaves
Several tens of thousands see
several hundred thousand
Palestinians go north the
North where this offensive began at
The day after October 7 there is
actually an intact determination
Israelis to continue this war
against Hamas and I also have to
specify that the fights pending
often pursue
Extremely hard uh in an in a few
only kilometers north of Rafar
Why Prime Minister Netanahou
Does he maintain such a firm line
not even listening to his allies
Americans by
example then I would say that there are two
main reasons for the pressure
American is not as strong as we
might believe that there are
very clear declarations by Joe Biden
who calls to stop fire that calls
to spare civilians but we see that
in reality and the army
American continues to provide
abundantly the Israeli army in
ammunition and weapons and at the level
politics we can see that
Americans continue to support Israel
Since the United States comes
to announce that they are opposed that they
would oppose a veau to the council of
security to a resolution requesting a
End the fire so the Israelisue
in a way to enjoy the
American support and then there is a
second reason more internal that one
is that Israeli society appears
united behind his government then
Certainly there are demonstrations there are
had yesterday in TÃ© Aviv but overall the
government the union cabinet which has
been trained to conduct this war will
Good Benigon is in the same line as
Benjamin Netanahou on Hafar and then
more broadly Israeli society
remains traumatized by the massacres of 7
October and she mainly wants
always the eradication of Hamas in the
Gaza VO band that's why for these
Two reasons why that's why Benjamin
Naliaou resists pressures
international
