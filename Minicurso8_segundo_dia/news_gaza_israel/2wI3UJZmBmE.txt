So in these circumstances of war ground
What is the situation, they also understand cities
What is the situation in how people
Ashutosh is forced to leave the house
One of our reports
See Hamas in the areas of Israel
I was attacked, now he was slowly lost
Ghost city in the town called
It is turning in it
We have come to the last part from where
The open area for Gaza border
Starts and when I come here
A picture of destruction appears from here
And are they so heavy shells on these trains
It was in the turn, actually Hamas terrorists
He had entered and he bullets indiscriminately
This is the person who had run this blood
His shoe was shot here
The cap is here
But that is, there was no chance to run away
Place only and only blood marks are behind
There was a child and see this that is the bullet
This entire area had gone ripping down
I am actually and the rest of the village you
Will see that all this is vacant here
It is not only the police here or so
There are people of the government and in addition to this
Ghos town is we have reached here
Kibbu Beri really beyond here in areas
There is an area of the operation being conducted there
But these bullet marks tell
How blind dhund bullets have been fired
That is, they knew who is going to die
But they are attacking these blood
The marks of the outer areas still
I am alive inside the city as far as
He could not enter terrorists to those areas
These bullets were targeted
See the targets as well as the attack here
Maybe these people probably escape from here
Wanted but suddenly so fast firing
People escaped and ran here before
Somebody's umbrella is also a child's jacket
And people tried to run away from here
There are so many bullets that whatever is here and
The terrorists could not save their lives
Death to death or you are watching
See, big sheets have been stained
Bullets gluten with modern weapons
When the terrorists entered and they got their complete
Target the city
