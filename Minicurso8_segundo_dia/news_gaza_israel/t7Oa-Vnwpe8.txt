it's not always easy to speak in time
like this there has been too much
violence and too much heartbreaking
brutality the escalations in the recent
weeks is UN careful to witness all lives
are sacred and must be protected the
maskers need to stop families are being
turned
apart what's clear now is that
humanitarian Aid to Gaza must be allowed
immediately the people there are in
terrible
conditions the scenes at the hospital
last night were
horrifying the people of Gaza need food
water and medical supplies urgently I'm
calling the world leaders to come
together to prevent the further
Slaughter of innocent Souls Humanity
must Prevail a political disaster is
underway and yet the security Council of
the United Nations is unable to say the
only thing that truly
matters stop the
Bloodshed I repeat stop the
Bloodshed for those who think they can
avert a humanitarian catastrophe and a
regional spell over while Israel continu
continues bombing and killing
Palestinians think again so far this
Council has not even condemned Hamas for
the atrocity it perpetrated let alone
held Hamas fully responsible for the
situation in Gaza but here we are
discussing humanitarian
corridors does nobody else see how
ludicrous this
is calling for calm restraint and
ceasefires is like putting a bandaid on
a bullet
