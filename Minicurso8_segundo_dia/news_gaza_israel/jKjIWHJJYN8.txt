Preposterous than this claim Israel's
president Isaac Herzog on Tuesday
talking about a lawsuit filed by South
Africa against his country at the
international court of justice it
accuses Israel of genocide against the
Palestinian people in its Gaza
offensive hearings in the icj case will
begin on Thursday asking for provisional
measures including an immediate
suspension of Israel's military campaign
but speaking during a visit by US
Secretary of State Anthony blinkin
Herzog accused South Africa of hypocrisy
actually our enemies the Hamas in their
Charter called for the destruction and
annihilation of the state of Israel the
only nation state of the Jewish people
Israel's offensive in the Palestinian
Enclave followed an October 7th
crossborder Rampage by Hamas in which
according to Israeli authorities
1,200 people were killed since then
Israeli forces have laid waste to much
of Gaza Health authorities there say
more than
23,000 people have been
killed nearly all of the 2.3 million
population have been driven from their
homes at least once causing a
humanitarian
catastrophe South Africa's case is that
by killing Palestinians causing them
serious mental and bodily harm and by
creating conditions on life quote
calculated to bring about their physical
destruction Israel is committing
genocide against them we will be there
at the international court of justice
and will present proudly our case of
using self-defense under our most
inherent right under International
humanitarian law Herzog claimed Israel
was doing its utmost to prevent civilian
casualties Israel blames Hamas over
harmed civilians for operating amongst
them which the fighters Deni
Herzog also thanked the US for standing
steadfast with Israel in this
battle
