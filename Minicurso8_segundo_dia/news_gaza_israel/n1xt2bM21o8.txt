Anthony's left center government
Albanese announced on Tuesday the revocation
of a decision of the previous executive
led by conservative Scott
Morrison
The Australian Embassy has always
status and is still in Tel Aviv el
Australian government is still committed
With a solution of two states in the
that Israel and a future Palestinian state
can coexist in peace and security with
internationally recognized borders
We will not support an approach that undermines this
perspective
Israel Yahir Lapid's Prime Minister
described the decision as precipitated and
He said the Australian government
manages other issues with more seriousness
and professionalism
Australians or anyone will decide
What is the capital of Israel in the
last three thousand years Jerusalem always
It has been the capital of Israel and will continue
doing it in the diplomatic field
We will respond to Australia in a way
ordered because this is how we work
For its part the Palestinian authority
celebrated Australia's decision
We believe that by doing this Australia has
corrected its erroneous position that was
taken by the previous government and
reconsidered in order to align
With international law
legitimacy and consensus regarding
The city of Jerusalem including the
rejection of all measures and
Israeli efforts to annex and
control the city
The previous Australian government continued
The bet in 2018 for the then
US President Donald Trump and
Jerusalem acknowledged as capital
from Israel a very critical decision in
The country most governments
Avoid placing their embassies in Jerusalem
claimed by Israelis and Palestinians
not to condition the result of a
eventual peace process between the two
sides
