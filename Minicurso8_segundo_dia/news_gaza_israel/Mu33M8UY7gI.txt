>> Sandra: THE IDF ARE
RELEASING THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF
HAMAS TUNNELS RUN RUNNING UNDER
AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL, SEIZING HAMAS
WEAPONS FOUND ON THE COMPLEX.
WE'VE BEEN COVERING THIS OUT OF
SOUTHERN ISRAEL.
WE'VE SEEN THE PICTURES.
WHAT MORE ARE WE LEARNING?
>> GOOD MORNING.
WE CONTINUE TO GET MORE
INFORMATION AS THE ISRAELIS
OPERATE IN THE AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL
AND SURROUNDING AREA.
THEY RELEASED THIS VIDEO
OVERNIGHT SAYING THIS IS A
TUNNEL UNDERNEATH THE COMPLEX
THAT SITS IN THE HEART OF GAZA
CITY.
THE ISRAELIS SAY THIS IS THE TIP
OF THE ICEBERG AND THEY ARE
STILL DOUBLING DOWN ON WHAT THEY
SAY IS A HAMAS COMMAND CENTER
UNDERNEATH THE HOSPITAL.
WE'VE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE TO
SUPPORT THOSE CLAIMS.
BUT AGAIN, THE ISRAELIS SAY MORE
WILL COME AS THEY HAVE TIME TO
EXCAVATE AND DIG THROUGH THE
AREA.
THEY FOUND MORE WEAPONS AT THE
AL-SHIFA MEDICAL CENTER.
WE SPOKE WITH HAMAS AND YOU CAN
HEAR ME THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT
OF ACTIVITY, THEY CONTINUE THEIR
AIR STRIKES.
WE SPOKE WITH A HAMAS OFFICIAL
SAYING THAT THEY DENIED AL-SHIFA
WAS BEING USED TO STORE WEAPONS.
BUT ISRAELIS HAVE POSTED MORE
IMAGES THAT THEY SAY ARE
SUPPLIES FOR HAMAS FIGHTERS TO
USE AT THE HOSPITAL, AS A BASE.
TWO HOSTAGES NEAR TO THE
HOSPITAL, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
YEHUDIT WEISS, A 65 OR A WOMAN
FROM A SMALL COMMUNITY, MOTHER
OF FIVE, HER HUSBAND WAS
MURDERED ON OCTOBER 7TH, AND SHE
WAS TAKEN INTO GAZA CITY.
THERE WAS HOPE SHE WAS STILL
ALIVE BUT ANOTHER TRAGIC
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE ISRAELI
PEOPLE.
THEY ALSO RECOVERED THE BODY OF
A 19-YEAR-OLD ISRAELI SOLDIER.
HAMAS RELEASED A PHOTO OF HER
BODY INDICATING SHE WAS KILLED
BY THE ISRAELIS.
THIS COME AS ISRAELI FORCES PUSH
DEEPER INTO GAZA CITY.
THEY SAY IT'S AN ISLAMIC JIHAD
COMMAND CENTER.
ALL OF THIS COMES AS THE CHIEF
OF STAFF AND ISRAEL SAYS FORCES
ARE PREPARED TO EN
