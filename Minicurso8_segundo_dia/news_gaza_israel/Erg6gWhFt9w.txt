THE AREA AROUND KHERSON IS 
CONSIDERED A CRUCIAL 
BATTLEGROUND AS VLADIMIR PUTIN'S
WAR ENTERS A SECOND YEAR.
CTV'S PAUL WORKMAN IS BACK IN 
THE CONFLICT ZONE WITH A STORY 
OF A BELEAGUERED TOWN STANDING 
TALL AND THE DEFIANT WOMAN KNOWN
AS THE UNBREAKABLE ANGEL OF 
ORIKIHIV. 
>> Reporter: IN THE LANDSCAPE OF
RUINS, BATTERED AND PUNISHED BY 
A YEAR OF RUSSIAN BOMBARDMENT, 
THE TOWN OF ORIKIHIV STANDS OUT.
AS MUCH FOR THE REGULAR POUNDING
IT ENDURES AS THE STAMINA, 
SUFFERING, AND RESISTANCE OF 
THOSE WHO REMAIN.
THIS IS YOUR OFFICE HERE.
SVITLANA MANDRYON IS THE DEPUTY 
MAYOR WHO REFUSED TO FOLLOW WHEN
JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS 
LEAVING.
STAYING AND TURNING THE PAYMENT 
OF CITY HALL INTO WHAT'S KNOWN 
AS AN INVINCIBILITY CENTRE.
OFFERING FOOD AND SHELTER TO ALL
WHO COME, AND IN THE PROCESS 
EARNING A NICKNAME.
[Speaking Alternative Language]
>> Reporter: THE UNBREAKABLE 
ANGEL OF ORIKIHIV.
DO YOU LIKE THAT?
[Speaking Alternative Language]
>> Reporter: OF COURSE, SHE 
SAYS.
AS A WOMAN, IT MAKES ME FEEL 
MORE SELF-ASSURED AND GIVES ME 
COURAGE BECAUSE I'M ALSO VERY 
OFTEN AFRAID.
14,000 PEOPLE LIVED HERE BEFORE 
RUSSIA'S INVASION.
NOW MAYBE 1,200.
MOSTLY OLD AND POOR.
VOLUNTEERS DELIVER WATER IN THE 
TOWN FIRE TRUCK.
UNDER THREAT OF ATTACK FROM 
RUSSIAN ARTILLERY JUST A FEW 
KILOMETERS AWAY.
INTO DARK BASEMENTS WHERE 
NEIGHBORHOOD TANKS ARE FILLED 
AND SHARED.
AND ANOTHER WOMAN NAMED SVITLANA
STRUGGLES WITH FEAR AND 
LONELINESS.
SHE'S 73.
[Speaking Alternative Language]
>> Reporter: WE'RE GOING TO GET 
THROUGH THIS, SHE SAYS.
THAT'S WHAT I TELL MY CHILDREN.
BUT MOSTLY I'M AFRAID I WON'T 
SEE MY FAMILY AGAIN.
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DEPUTY 
MAYOR'S BASEMENT SHELTER WAS 
BOMBED EARLY ON.
ROUSING A PERSONAL PROMISE FROM 
THE ANGEL, WHO FELT IT WAS HER 
DUTY TO STAY.
THE MAYOR, A MAN, LEFT WITH THE 
OTHERS.
[Speaking Alternative Language]
>> Reporter: MY WORK IS ACTUALLY
TO HELP PEOPLE, SHE SAYS.
ME AND MY FAMILY DECIDED TO STAY
UNTIL UKRAINE WINS.
SHE SAYS SHE IS ALREADY PLANNING
FOR AND DREAMING OF THAT MOMENT,
WHEN THE RUSSIANS ARE GONE AND 
ORIKIHIV CAN REBUILD.
THERE'S A LOT OF FIGHTING AHEAD 
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, IF EVER.
EUROPEAN LEADERS WARNED TODAY 
THAT UKRAINE I
