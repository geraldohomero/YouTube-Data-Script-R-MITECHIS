the mutual cease fire that came into
effect at 2 a.m on friday has prevented
further killings hamas chief ismailia
says this is a strategic victory for
palestinians
this victory is a strategic victory why
because the stage that comes after the
battle of the sword of jerusalem is not
like what it was before
the battle of the sword of jerusalem
ended a lot of stages and opened the
door to new stages that will witness a
lot of victories a lot of successes and
a lot of strategic building on all
levels
therefore today we consider that this
battle is a quantum leap in the history
of the conflict with the enemy
his country achieved its aims
we destroyed a significant part of the
metro an underground terror city under
gaza from where hamas thought his people
could hide and run their war without
hindrance for years we have prepared a
meticulous plan of hitting the metro
from the air their shafts bunkers and
the underground tunnels in this too
hamas has invested enormous capital
years of works and this too has gone
down the drain hamas can't hide anymore
palestinians had no doubt who the victor
was
they celebrated on the streets of gaza
the occupy west bank and occupied
jerusalem
but palestinian muslims who came to
al-aqsa for friday prayer and
celebration of the ceasefire still faced
israeli police attacks
israeli police used rubber quarters
steel bullets and stunning grenades
against palestinians
police claimed that palestinians threw
stones and petrol bombs towards them
after the ceasefire palestinians again
started their day with the israeli
occupation that has been taking place
since 1967. core differences of
palestine and israel such as the states
of jerusalem are far from resolved 13
palestinian families who are under the
threat of forced eviction in the sheikh
sharath neighborhood still wait for an
israeli court's final verdict and it
looks like as long as israel continues
its occupation another round of fighting
is inevitable mustafa fatih world
occupied is jerusalem
