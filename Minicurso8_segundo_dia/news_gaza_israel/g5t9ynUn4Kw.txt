from next week in israel having children
through surrogacy will be allowed for
same-sex couples as well as single men
and transgender people
rights groups have welcomed the
announcement calling it a historic day
our correspondent jody cohen getting you
this special report
in 1992 discrimination in the workplace
against lgbtq individuals was outlawed
in israel
the following year openly gay people
were allowed to serve in any position in
the army and in 2005 israeli lgbtq
couples were granted full adoption
rights
[Music]
however only traditional couples and
single women were eligible to have
children born through surrogacy
health minister horowitz who is openly
gay himself and his merits party made
promoting equal rights for the lgbtq
community a key plank of their party's
policies
in october restrictions on blood
donations from homosexual men were
lifted and now in the latest israel has
widened surrogacy rules to include
same-sex couples transgender people and
single men
horowitz said the move which comes into
effect on january 11th will enable quote
future fathers gay couples and
essentially every person in israel equal
access to surrogacy
i spoke with one couple who have gone
through surrogacy abroad about their
experiences and what the rule change in
israel will mean in practice
we just got back from florida last month
with our second sign adam we've been
through the journey twice abroad
it's very difficult managing everything
from the other side of the world
so in terms of doing it in israel things
are going to be a lot easier if if it
was
possible to do it here in the country
i'm glad for
other couples and single people single
gay
men and women
to be able to do this journey in israel
with
should make things
much easier and a good step in the right
directions for the gay community
in many countries in west asia people
are still arrested beaten and sometimes
even killed simply for being gay despite
israel being a traditional society and
some opposition to gay marriage coming
from the ultra-orthodox jewish and
muslim communities israel has a long
history of gay rights and this
announcement on surrogacy has been
welcomed as another step towards greater
equality this is jody cohen for we on
