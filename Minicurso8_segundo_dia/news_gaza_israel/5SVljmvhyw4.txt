A very particular kibot is called Metzer
It is a kibot founded in the year
1953 by a group of Argentines
Argentines from different provinces that
They created this one that has around
450 hectares between the rural area of
field work the community area and
the area of residences and that is
Very close to the border with S Jordan
Notice what is seen back that that
Wall is the wall that divides Israel
of S Jordan and here around this
Kibot this there are several cities and
populations of Arab origin that are
from Israel's side and where
