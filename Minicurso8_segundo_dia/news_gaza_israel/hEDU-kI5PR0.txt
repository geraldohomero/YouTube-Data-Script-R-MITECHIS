tensions are high over new intelligence
that appears to show russia in the
advanced stages of planning an invasion
of ukraine the pentagon is keeping an
eye on the potential powder keg with the
u.s president saying he's made plans to
talk to his russian counterpart by video
call on tuesday ctv's paul workman on
what's at stake
if the russians invade these trenches
will be ukraine's first line of defense
soldiers can't see the massive troop
buildup along the border but they know
it's there and they understand what's
expected of them
if they attack us we're ready to fight
back he says we've been waiting for this
for a long time
ukrainian forces holding artillery
drills close to the border with crimea
russia calls that a provocation ukraine
calls it readiness
a u.s intelligence report warns of a
possible large-scale russian invasion
early next year
maybe they're just provoking us
nobody knows what our enemy is thinking
what president vladimir putin is
thinking about is blocking nato from
expanding eastward he wants guarantees
that won't happen
the threat is really growing he said
this week look at how close nato is to
our border
and that's the looming confrontation
facing joe biden and putin next week
we're aware of russia's actions for a
long time
and
my expectation is we're going to have a
long discussion
the two leaders met face to face last
june in geneva in their first big summit
these talks will be far more tense
well we don't know what putin wants and
maybe he doesn't even know what he wants
but
i think
he's like a chess player so he strikes
when uh your opponent is vulnerable
the peril of invasion is all too real
for the people of donetsk
they've suffered through years of
russian meddling and insurgency always
wondering what's next
that's just too good nothing good will
come of this she says
maybe it will lead to nuclear war
biden says he will make it very very
difficult for the russian leader to
invade ukraine that suggests a military
response though the americans haven't
said what actions they might take sandy
all right paul thank you
