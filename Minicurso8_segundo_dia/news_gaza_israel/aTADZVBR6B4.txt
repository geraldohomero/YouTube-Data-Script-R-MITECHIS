we're here to to let the Arab people
wake up free Palestine
uh okay so it's time to wake up
[Music]
please
we as Arab group as you see all of us
United
outraged by this massacre that has taken
place committed by the Israeli
forces against a
hospital the Lutheran
Hospital in uh the Gaza
Strip in which according to the the
initial
figures about 500 civilians have been
torn
apart and
massacred in this outrageous illegal
crime committed by the Israeli forces
against our people in the Gaza Strip we
condemn this uh action in the strongest
possible terms and we hold Israel
responsible for this Massacre this crime
and those responsible for this crime
should face Justice and should face
accountability and should be you know uh
punishment uh uh rising to the level of
this crime committed against our people
to be faced by them we as an Arab group
demand immediately a ceasefire because
the continuation of of the war it means
killing more Palestinians every moment
had the security Council shouldered its
responsib responsibility
yesterday and stopped the fighting
yesterday stopped the war the aggression
the crime against our people
yesterday then we would have been able
to have those 500 killed still alive and
with us I can confirm that an analysis
of the IDF operational systems indicates
that a barriage of rockets was fired by
terrorists in Gaza passing in close
proximity to the alali AL madii Hospital
in Gaza at the time it was hit
intelligence from few sources that we
have in our hands indicates that the
Islamic Jihad is responsible for the
failed rocket launch which hit the
hospital in Gaza I repeat this is the
responsibility of Islamic Jihad that
killed Innocents in the hospital in
