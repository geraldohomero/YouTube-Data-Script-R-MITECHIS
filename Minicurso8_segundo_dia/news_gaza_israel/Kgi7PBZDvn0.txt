D
STABILIZE THE SITUATION.
THANK YOU.
>> SO FROM A TEAM MANAGEMENT
PERSPECTIVE AT THIS POINT IT IS
STILL A VERY ACTIVE SCENE.
HIGHLAND PARK POLICE DEPARTMENT
IS LEADING THE INVESTIGATION AS
WELL AS APPREHENSION EFFORTS TO
THE OFFENDER INVOLVE.
AS THE MAYOR SAID WE'RE ASKING
EVERY ONE TO STAY INDOORS RIGHT
NOW.
THIS PERSON IS NOT IDENTIFIED.
BY ALL MEANS THIS APPEARS TO BE
COMPLETELY RANDOM.
WITH THAT QUESTIONS COMING IN
ARE EVENTS SAFE TONIGHT?
THAT'S UP TO EACH INDIVIDUAL
COMMUNITY TO ASSESS ON THEIR OWN
AND MAKE THE DETERMINATION.
NOSE THIS PERSON IS NOT YET IN
CUSTODY.
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF POLICE OUT
HERE AS THE MAYOR SAID FROM FBI
AND STATE POLICE AND SWAT TEAMS
GOING DOOR TO DOOR AS WELL.
ANYBODY WITH ANY VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE IS STRONGLY
ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THE
HIGHLAND PARK POLICE DEPARTMENT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND IT
CAN BE USEFUL IN THE
INVESTIGATION.
THE FBI IS WORKING HAND IN HAND
WITH THE LAKE COUNTY MAJOR CRIME
TASK FORCE RIGHT NOW PROCESSING
THE SCENE.
IT WILL BE PROCESSING OF THE
SCENE AND INVESTIGATION HAS
COMMENCED UNDER WAY.
WE WILL DO THE BEST TO PROVIDE
BRIEFING UPDATES EVERY 30
MINUTES TO THE HOUR IF WE CAN.
WE WILL KEEP THE COMMUNITY
INFORMED.
WITH THAT WE THANK YOU FOR
COVERING THIS AND SHARING THIS
INFORMATION.
AGAIN, VERY SAD DAY HERE.
>> [ INAUDIBLE ]
>> IT WAS A RIFLE.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION
ON WHERE THE SUSPECT COULD BE
RIGHT NOW ANY AT ALL --
>> THERE IS NO INDICATION HE'S
BARRICADED ANYWHERE OR HAS ANY
HOSTAGES.
THAT HAS BEEN KIND OF CIRCLING
AROUND.
NO INDICATION OF THAT.
INVESTIGATORS ARE VERY, VERY
QUICKLY WORKING TO TRY TO
IDENTIFY WHO THIS PERSON IS AND
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE HE'S
AT.
>> HOW MANY SHOTS FIRED?
>> [ INAUDIBLE ] WHAT IS
HAPPENING WITH --
>> SO IT DOES APPEARANCE HE WAS
SHOOTING FROM THE ROOF.
THE ROOF THAT HE WAS SHOOTING
FROM, I DON'T HAVE THAT
INFORMATION RIGHT NOW.
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SHOTS
FIRED.
>> AND WHAT AGENCIES.
>> MULTIPLE AGENCIES.
HIGHLAND AND THE LAKE COUNTY
TASK FORCE IS WORKING WITH THE
FBI ON THE INVESTIGATION.
AND OF COURSE WORKING WITH
HIGHLANDMARK POLICE DETECTIVES.
THEY ARE VERY INVOLVED.
>> [ INAUDIBLE ]
>> NOT INFORMATION I CAN RELEASE
JUST YET.
>> DID HE HAVE MORE THAN ONE
WEAPON.
>> NOT INFORMATION I CAN
RELEASE.
WE CONSIDER HIM ARMED AND
DANGEROUS.
