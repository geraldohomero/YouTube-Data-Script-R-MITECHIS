for some of the saudi's neighbors in the
gulf
it's an uncomfortable moment what having
recently
normalized ties with israel with those
abraham accords brokered by donald trump
delana de souza has more months after
the abraham accords were signed
the historic agreement is being put to
the test
signatories including the uae bahrain
and morocco have denounced the use of
force by israeli security personnel
against palestinians in jerusalem in the
aftermath of events on monday abu
dhabi's crown prince called for the end
to all aggressions and wrath in the
sacred city
bahrain reaffirmed its support for a
two-state solution
while denouncing provocations against
the people of jerusalem
and morocco dubbed the escalation and
violence extremely worrying
arab leaders who have warmed up to
israel need to strike the right balance
on the global stage and at home
with the palestinian cause once again in
the forefront
hashtags in the uae and bahrain were
trending online in support of
palestinians facing evictions in east
jerusalem
and in morocco hundreds have taken to
the streets in protest
[Applause]
the harshest criticism of all has come
from saudi arabia
which hasn't officially normalized ties
with israel but is widely seen
as calling the shots the storming of the
al-aqsa mosque
the violation of the sanctity of
worshippers
and the attacks on the palestinian
people and their sanctuaries
represents a violation of all
international treaties that protect
freedom of belief and the practice of
religious rights
the arab league on tuesday called on the
international community to stop the
escalating violence
and has condemned israel's deadly
airstrikes on gaza
