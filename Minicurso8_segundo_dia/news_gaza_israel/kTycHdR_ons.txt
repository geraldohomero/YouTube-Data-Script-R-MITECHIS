speee
for
for
to contribute something to help these
people on this reporting about the media
is covering this
war sub
[Music]
this
for
and let's be clear I mean I was one of
the first Le to call H prime minister
and president of is after the terrorist
attack the 7th of October we clearly
condemn this terorist terorist attack
and terrorist group and recognize the
right of Israel to protect itself and
react but day one we say that this
reaction and the fight against
terrorism because it is led by a
democracy should be compliant with
International rules all of war and and
humanitarian international
law and day after day what we saw is a
permanent bombing of civilians in
Gaza I think this is the Only Solution
we have this is fire because it's
impossible to explain we want to fight
against
terrorism by killing innocent people
look in the very first days it's clear
that the emotion The
Compassion um created a situation where
everybody was just close to Israel and
beging them and U sharing the pain
and we do share the pain and we do share
the willingness uh to get rid of
terrorism we we know what terrorism
means in
France but I think there is no
justification precisely to attack
civilians look I I think it's not the
proper way to approach the
question we do recognize their right to
protect
themselves and and one month after this
terrorist attack I think it would be not
the right way to deal with a a a partner
and friend just to say you will be
condemned and you are
guilty de
facto today civilians are
bombed de facto this babies ladies is
old people are bombed and killed there
is no reason for
that
