the siege that was made to Leningrad and
qualifies it as something unacceptable Javi
Yes, as the said, the
President of the Russian Federation of
unacceptable this siege to the strip of
Gaza by the Israeli army

Soviet strategic in Leningrado that
was cited by the Germans until
1900 2 44 The fact is that it has identified

Leningrad siege in more than 2
millions of people live in the
territory is what the
Russian to 1 million has been asked that
North goes down south for possible sieges

also adds the situation is similar to
that of a few decades and the population
civil is the one that is suffering most in
These moments well then Javi many
