JOINING ME NOW IS HAILEY.
I HAVE TO START WITH YOU AND
THIS HORRIBLE NEWS THAT IT
ACCIDENTALLY KILLED THREE
ISRAELI HOSTAGES.
THAT'S THE VERY LATEST THAT YOU
ARE HEARING ABOUT THAT?
>> Reporter: WE ARE HEARING NOW
FROM THE ISRAELI PRIME
MINISTER.
IN JUST THE LAST LITTLE BIT
CALLING AN UNBEARABLE TRAGEDY
FOR HIS COUNTRY SAYING THAT THE
COUNTRY IS IN DEEP SORROW AND
MOURNING AFTER NEWS THAT'S IDF
HAVE MISTAKENLY KILLED THREE
HOSTAGES.
HOSTAGES.
UNCLEAR IF THEY ESCAPED OR WER
ABANDONED.
THEIR FAMILIES ARE MOURNING
THEM TONIGHT.
THIS HAD BEEN -- IN SOME
INSTANCES -- IN MANY WAYS THE
NIGHTMARE SITUATION FOR THE
HOSTAGE FAMILY MEMBERS WE HAVE
BEEN TALKING TO WHO ARE
DESPERATE TO GET THEIR LOVED
ONES HOME AND THAT IS WHY YOU
ARE SEEING SUCH A SHOW OF
SUPPORT FOR THOSE FAMILIES IN
ISRAEL.
WE ARE ALSO HEARING NEW
REACTION NOW FROM BACK HOME IN
WASHINGTON FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION THAT YOU HAVE
COVERED OF COURSE AND THAT IS
FROM THE NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL, JOHN KI RBY TALKING
ABOUT THIS SAYING THAT DOESN'T
WANT TO GET TO MUCH INTO
SPECIFICS.
THE SPECIFICS AREN'T CLEAR AT
THIS MOMENT BUT OF COURSE
CALLING THIS A TRAGIC MISTAKE
ESSENTIALLY AS YOU -- I BELIEVE
ARE LOOKING LIVE AT SOME OF THE
PICTURES FROM AROUND A PLACE
CALLED HOSTAGE SQUARE.
I BELIEVE SOME OF THE FAMILIES
ON THE MOVE THIS IS A LOCATION
WE ARE HEADED TO AFTER WE
FINISH TALKING TO YOU.
THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING ON
THE STREETS.
WE WILL GET TO MORE INFORMATION
ABOUT WHAT IS GOING DOWN ON
THAT LIVE SHOT.
WE WILL BRING THAT TO YOU BUT
AGAIN QUESTIONS ABOUT DID THESE
HOSTAGES TRY TO SPEAK HEBREW?
DID THEY TRY TO INDICATE THEY
HAD BEEN ABDUCTED TO THE TROOPS
WHO MISTAKENLY IDENTIFIED THEM
AS TERROR THREATS?
THERE WILL BE A MASSIVE
