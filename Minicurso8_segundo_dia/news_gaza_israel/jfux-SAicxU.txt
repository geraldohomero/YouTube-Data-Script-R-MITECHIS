Our compatriots to Israel when
The first flight arrived there was a woman who
He had a moving gesture when he stepped on
Mexican soil our reporter David

Sedano Herminia originally from Michoacán
He was the first person to descend from
Mexican Air Force plane that
He left Israel in rescue mission and
Because of his emotion he incó to kiss the
Mexican soil that emotion of already
get off from seeing to see who is then
You must first the Mexican soil
for this for the emotion of having
returned from having returned this
Here the plane
737800 Registration 3528 of the Air Force
Mexican landed at 1905 on the track
of the Military Air Base number one in
Santa Lucía State of Mexico after 22
flight hours from airport
International David B Curion of the
Catholic Fiel Telavid City made
For the first time his trip to Israel
To know the places where he was
Jesus and the war came when
I found in the mount of the
Olivos as the impression that where we
grabbed it was on the mount of olive trees
enam in Heeman where Jesus Christ
cried and spilled blood this was
where we were in a mass in an hour
Santa and is where when we left they were
They gave us the news we were in
war and then I never imagined
that then I was going to grab that there
Hermina traveled only with her friends and
group companions who made the
Pilgrimage People of the Third
Age and adults from Sinaloa
narrated acan who suddenly saw each other
surrounded by terrorism ever very
very fatal because they tell us about
Let's take refuge to the hotel
Let's not go out without not
your responsibility because it is a lot
as the pressure of one huh and well it was
very very very stressful now the
concern to know what they are still
Many Mexican pilgrims who
They remain in Israel in the middle of the
Attacks to the civilian population
concern that I would like
As they rescued me they rescued them
all of them to all and but through
You do that management that there is
What to rescue them for image David
