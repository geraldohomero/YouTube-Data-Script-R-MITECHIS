I asked Israel
Not that is no safe place in
The entire Gaza Strip for hundreds of
Thousands of Gazatí as you said but huh
Because the army had advised them
At first they flee towards
The south because it was going to be a safe place

occupation are exercising are with a
intense battle there in Gaza nobody is
safe is a new exodus has said

About 150,000 Palestinians have had
to move again but the Gazatí
Not only do they have to fight to survive
They also have to fight to find

Palestine suffers the risk of running H

They intensify in Gaza Capital and Yalia
To the north they also extend to

to flee south but there Israel continues
bombing cities like Rafaj Jan

Schools should be places
Insurance but that Israel's army
