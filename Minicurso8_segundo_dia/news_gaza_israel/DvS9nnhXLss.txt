LOOKING AT ISRAEL INVOLVING
HAMAS ON THE EVE OF WHAT COULD
BE A GROUND INVASION IN GAZA,
WHAT LESSONS CAN WE LEARN ON
THE KOREAN PENINSULA? SHAWN:
IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT THE
KOREAN WAR.
IT IS THE WAY NORTH KOREA'S
SURPRISE ATTACKED SOUTH KOREA
IN 1950 AND THE USE OF TUNNELS
WHICH NORTH KOREA USES.
THEY ATTACKED THE BLUE HOUSE
AND TRIED TO ASSASSINATE THE
KOREAN PRESIDENT.
THOSE WERE TUNNELS UNDER THE
DNC WHICH I MYSELF HAVE VISITED.
AS ONE OF MY FRIENDS POINTED
OUT, THEY SUPPLY HAMAS WITH
WEAPONS THROUGH IRAN.
-- THE WAY THEY TRIED TO
OVERWHELM IRON DOME WITH THE
ROCKETS IT IS ELEMENTARY.
WE HAVE A ANTIMISSILE DEFENSE
SHIELD IN SOUTH KOREA AND
OTHERS.
AND THEY ARE PROBABLY THINKING
HOW CAN THEY OVERWHELM SOUTH
KOREA AND I SEE A LOT SOUTH
KOREA COULD PAY ATTENTION TO
WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
ISRAEL RIGHT NOW. KAILEY:
AND THE U.S.
DOME, THEY HAVE ART -- THE U.S.
HAS ALREADY PROMISED TO DELIVER
WHAT ISRAEL NEEDS BUT THERE IS
ONE THING IN CONVERSATION WITH
AID FOR UKRAINE AND AID FOR
TAIWAN.
IS THERE DANGER IN TRYING TO DO
ALL OF THE FUNDING AND SHOULD
THIS BE ADDRESSED INDIVIDUALLY?
SEAN:
IT WOULD BE RIGHT IF WE COULD
LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL MERITS
IDEALLY.
BUT AS WE HEAD INTO A POSSIBLE
ELECTION SITE -- ELECTION CYCLE
WITHOUT A SPEAKER.
THE WORLD IS ON FIRE IT IS NOT
WAITING FOR US WE NEED TO DO IT
IN WHATEVER WAY AS POSSIBLE.
WE DO NOT LIVE AND AND IDEAL
WORLD.
-- WE DO NOT LIVE IN AN IDEAL
WORLD. SEAN:
TAIWAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A THREAT
FOR ABOUT 21 YEARS I HAVE
FOLLOWED IT.
I DO NOT SEE THE PERILS BETWEEN
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ISRAEL AND
TAIWAN.
PEOPLE THINK MAY BE BEIJING
COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE.
BUT IF THEY DID NOT TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE DEFICIT OF THE
WAR IN 2023, WE ARE NOT
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THIS.
CAPABILITIES HAVE INCREASED, WE
HAVE AN ELECTION IN JANUARY,
BUT I DO NOT THINK THIS
INCIDENT ALONE, ISRAEL IS VERY
DISAPPOINTED WITH BEIJING'S
LACK OF A CLEAR COMBINATION OF
HAMAS AGENTS IN THE LAST FEW
DAYS. KAILEY:
DO YOU THINK ALL OF THIS IS A
RESULT OF THE U.S.
BEING SEEN AS -- WITHOUT A
SPEAKER ON THE GLOBAL STAGE?
HOW MUCH OF THIS IS A GLOBAL
REFLECTION? SEAN:
NO I THINK THIS IS THE HAMAS
AND THEY WOULD DO THIS SOONER
THAN LATER.
IT IS NOT ALWAYS ABOUT US.
WE ARE NOT FRONT RUNNING ANY OF
THIS IT IS JUST BAD PEOPLE
DOING BAD THINGS.
