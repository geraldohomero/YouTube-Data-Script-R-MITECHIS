 
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE 
PRIORITIES AND AGENDA AND WHAT 
WE ARE LOOKING TO DO.
>> I KNOW JOHN KIRBY ADDRESSED 
THE PROTESTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES
AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT RESPECTS FIRST 
AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO PROTEST.
BUT DOES THE PRESIDENT VIEW 
ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS AND 
SENTIMENT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AS
ANTI-SEMITISM?
>> LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO GET 
INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE
COUNTRY AT DIFFERENT 
UNIVERSITIES.
NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE 
SPECIFICS AS THE ADMIRAL SAID, 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT AND 
PEACEFUL PROTEST IS PART OF OUR 
DEMOCRACY, BEING ABLE FOR FOLKS 
TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR 
FEELINGS.
I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO ANY 
SPECIFICS ON THAT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY 
CLEAR IN WANTING TO MAKE SURE 
THAT JEWISH AMERICANS, WANTING 
TO MAKE SURE THAT ARAB 
AMERICANS, MUSLIMS ARE PROTECTED
HERE.
WHAT HE BELIEVES IN, THAT THEY 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE THEIR 
LIVES AND FEEL PROTECTION AND 
ABLE TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY.
THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN VERY, 
VERY CLEAR ON DENOUNCING ANY 
TYPE OF VIOLENCE AND SO AS IT 
RELATES TO PEACEFUL PROTESTING, 
PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO 
THAT.
BUT WE ARE JUST NOT GOING TO GET
INTO BLOW BY BLOWS OF WHAT'S 
GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY 
CLEAR, VERY CLEAR.
>> NOT BLOW BY BLOW BUT THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID SILENCE 
IS COMPLICITY.
SO ANTI-SEMITISM LETTERS SENT BY
STUDENTS OR PROTESTS -- 
>> OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT IS 
AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM, OF 
COURSE.
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT THAT YOU 
HAVE HEARD ME SAY IS -- WANTS TO
PROTECT COMMUNITIES.
WHETHER IT'S THE JEWISH 
COMMUNITY, THE ARAB AMERICAN 
COMMUNITY, PALESTINIAN 
COMMUNITY, HE IS GOING TO SPEAK 
OUT AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM, TOO.
YOU ASKED ME ABOUT PROTEST -- 
>> TALK TO THE PROTESTORS YOU'LL
HEAR THE ANTI-SEMITISM 
COMMENTS -- 
>> WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO 
DENOUNCE ANTI-SEMITISM BUT 
PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
PEACEFULLY PROTEST.
WE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION ARE 
ALWAYS GOING TO DENOUNCE 
ANTI-SEMITISM, ANY FORM OF HATE,
ANY FORM OF HATE, WHETHER IT'S 
AGAINST THE JEWISH COMMUNITY, 
RIGHT, ANTI-SEMITISM AGAINST THE
MUSLIM COMMUNITY, ARAB 
AMERICAN -- WE ARE GOING TO 
DENOUNCE ANY FORM OF HATE THAT 
COMES TOWARDS THOSE COMMUNITIES.
PEACEFUL PROTESTS, PEOPLE HAVE 
THE RIGHT TO DO THAT, BUT THIS 
IS AN ADMINISTRATION OBVIOUSLY, 
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GOING TO BE
