There we were then on Avenida
Entre Ríos in the National Congress
Listening to this press conference
Later we will offer you more
details at this time we will resume
International information in
particular we are going to find in the high
European Union Commissioner for
Foreign Affairs Foreign policy
What is Jusep Borrel the Catalan of the
Socialist Party that said the Union
European as a whole because he
represents the foreign policy of this
supranational organism accuses Israel
to found and finance
Borrel never continued with his criticisms of
Israel in his speech in front of a forum
who attended the business school
Next Education in Madrid in the capital
From Spain I do not say that there is
financed through a check that
has sent but what has facilitated the
Development of never explained
Borrel reiterating his previous statement
that Israel is the one who founded and financed
Never has Israel played the division
of the Palestinians creating a force that
He opposed Fat is a reality
unquestionable I have limited myself to repeating
A well -known phrase from the Lord
Netanyahu said in public in front of your
parliamentary group where he says that everyone
Those who oppose the solution of
two states must contribute and facilitate
The financing of ever Borrel the boss
From the diplomacy of the European Union
He also defended the solution of
The two states to find a
Departure to conflict criticizing Israel
for opposing but at the same time not
propose the government
Israelí says what he doesn't want but not
says what you want what your solution is
But they want based security
only in military media
Frankly I think there is better
solutions and I think the intervention
Israel's military in Gaza is
disproportionate is causing a
excessive number of civil victims and
This has nothing to do with the
anti -Semitism of course either
I am anti -Semitic said Jusep Borrel almost
30,000 Palestinians most of them
Children have died in intense attacks
from Israel against the Gaza Strip from
October 7 according to the organization
terrorist
