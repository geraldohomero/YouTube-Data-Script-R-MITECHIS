THAT IS THE CASE FOR THEM MORE
THAN 100,000 VETERANS IN
ISRAEL'S NEGATIVE DESERT.
NOW PUSHED TO THE EDGE IN THE
FIRST WEEKS OF THE ISRAEL-HAMAS
WAR.
NBC'S JAY GRAY HAS MORE.
NBC'S JAY GRAY HAS MORE.
>> HISTORY AND HATREDS THE BED
WEDNESDAY HAVE LEFT THEM WITH
NO PLACE TO CALL HOME.
MORE THAN 100,000 LIVING IN THE
BEGET DESERT, THEIR VILLAGES,
UNRECOGNIZED BY ISRAEL WHICH
MEANS NO POWER, WATER, OR PAVED
ROADS, PERMANENT BUILDINGS, ARE
CONSIDERED ILLEGAL, AND THEY
SAY OFTEN DEMOLISHED BY
GOVERNMENT CRUISE.
>> WE SUFFER AS ISRAELI
CITIZENS, WE SUFFER AS ARAB
CITIZENS, WE SUFFER AS
BEDOUINS.
>> --
A BED WHEN LAWYER AND FORMER --
HE WORKED TO HAVE MORE THAN A
DOZEN BEDOUINS COMMUNITIES
RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE, AND
SAYS THIS WAR HAS TIGHTENED
WHAT WAS ALREADY A SUFFOCATING
GRIP ON HIS PEOPLE.
>> IF IT'S QUIET, WE SUFFER
FROM DISCRIMINATION AND IF IT'S
WAR, WE SUFFER FROM ROCKETS.
THAT'S NOT SO NICE TO BE IN THE
SITUATION.
>> IT'S NO WHEN.
>> JUST LOSE.
YOU CAN'T WIN.

7TH ATTACKS, AND COMMUNITY
LEADERS SAY SEVEN MORE TAKEN AS
HOSTAGES, INCLUDING SIMILAR --
WHOSE FAMILY SAYS THEY CAME
ACROSS THIS PICTURE OF HIM,
WHICH NBC CANNOT VERIFY, ON
SOCIAL MEDIA, AFTER HE WAS
CAPTURED.
>> FOR A MONTH, WE'VE BEEN
PRAYING TO GOD FOR HIM TO
RETURN TO US IN GOOD HEALTH.
WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP,
EAT, OR DO ANYTHING.
>> THIS COMMUNITY WAS SO LITTLE,
STRUGGLING LONG BEFORE THE WAR,
NOW, PUSHED TO THE EDGE,
WRAPPED IN FEAR.

EVERYONE.

DAUGHTER, --
, HAS TROUBLE SPEAKING, AT
TIMES, STUTTERING AND
STAMMERING.
>> OTHERS, RAMBLING
INCOHERENTLY.
>> THE GIRL IS NOT DOING WELL.
SHE SCARED AND TRAUMATIZED FROM
THE MISSILES THAT VIBRATE THE
WHOLE AREA LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE.
>> IN A PLACE THAT HAS NO
PROTECTION FROM ISRAEL'S IRON
DOME, NO WARNING SIRENS, AND NO
SHELTERS.
AFTER TWO MISSILE STRIKES THAT
KILLED FOUR IN THIS VILLAGE,
THE DEFENSE MINISTRY DELIVERED
THESE CONCRETE DRAINAGE PIPES
TO USE AS A SHELTERS FOR 100
