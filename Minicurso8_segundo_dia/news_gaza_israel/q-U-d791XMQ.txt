>> CONGRESSMAN, AS YOU KNOW,
LOOMING LARGE OVER THAT EVENT
INCLUDING WITH SOME PROTESTERS
IS THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST
AND, IN FACT, A NEW GALLOP POLL
NOW OPPOSE ISRAEL'S WAR IN GAZA
AND APPROVAL HAS DROPPED FROM 50
TO 36% SINCE NOVEMBER.
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF
INTERRUPTIONS AT THAT FUND
RAISER AND A GROWING NUMBER OF
DEMOCRATS ARE CALLING THIS A
GENOCIDE INCLUDING ALEXANDRA
OCASIO-CORTEZ.
CONGRESSMAN, DO YOU AGREE WITH
CONGRESSWOMAN OCASIO-CORTEZ THAT
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS, IN FACT, A
GENOCIDE?
>> WELL, I WOULD NOT ANALYZE IT
TO THAT EXTENT, BUT I'LL TELL
YOU THIS.
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS WRONG AND
THEY NA TO MAKE IT RIGHT AND
THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS
TRYING TO DO, TRYING TO MAKE IT
RIGHT.
THAT POLL SHOWED MORE OF A
DISSAEFGSZ WITH NETANYAHU THAN
WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL.
WE STAND WITH THE PEOPLE OF
ISRAEL.
WE DO NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT
THIS COUNTRY'S POLICY IS A
TWO-STATE SOLUTION AND NETANYAHU
HAS UNDERMINED THAT TWO-STATE
SOLUTION FOR AS LONG AS HE'S
BEEN IN OFFICE.
HE SOLD HIS SOUL TO THE
RIGHT-WINGERS IN ISRAEL IN ORDER
TO MAINTAIN POWER FOR HIMSELF
AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE OPPOSED TO
A TWO-STATE SOLUTION.
BIDEN IS FOR A TWO-STATE
SOLUTION.
DEMOCRATS ARE FOR A TWO-STATE
SOLUTION.
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY FOR US TO
MOVE FORWARD, AND SO THIS DROP
IN SUPPORT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH NETANYAHU.
>> CONGRESSMAN, DO YOU THINK THE
U.S. IS DOING ENOUGH, THOUGH?
IT JUST APPROVED ANOTHER ORDER
OF SHIPMENTS OF MUNITIONS AND
WEAPONS TO ISRAEL.
CHRIS VAN HOLLAND SAYING, QUOTE,
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NEEDS
TO USE ITS LEVERAGE EFFECTIVELY
BEFORE GREENLIGHTING MORE BOMBS
FOR GAZA.
COMMITMENTS TO PRESERVE CIVILIAN
LIVES IS WHAT HE'S REFERENCING
AND SHOULD THE U.S. BE
WITHHOLDING THOSE MUNITION
SHIPMENTS?
>> THE LEVERAGE HAS TO BE USED
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
USING HIS LEVERAGE.
>> BUT IS HE USING ENOUGH OF IT,
CONGRESSMAN?
THEY JUST APPROVED THAT NEW
SHIPMENT OF WEAPONS.
>> WELL, THE QUESTION IS WHAT
WERE THE AGREEMENTS MADE LAST
YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE AND
WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO
KEEP OUR WORD?
WE CANNOT GO BACK ON OUR WORD
AND EXPECT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO
KEEP THEIRS.
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR WORD, AND
SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MAY BE IN
THESE DEALS AND WHAT THE
PRESIDENT MAY BE LIVING UP TO,
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE
