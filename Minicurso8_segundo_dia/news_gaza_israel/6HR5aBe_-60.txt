day 60 already of the war in Israel and
Start entering at decisive moments
Why because we are already in full
Resumption of fighting does not seem
have perspective of a return to some
Type of truce and while they continue
some images like the one you are
Seeing of fighting that are followed
developing in the north of the strip
of gaza that is already practically low
Israeli control insist on what is the
north although these spotlights remain
resistance of the terrorist group ever
that comes just trying
ambush the Israeli soldiers
operating center moves towards the
south especially towards the town of
Shan Yunis who is the main
Urbanization that has the south of the
Gaza Strip there have entered
and Israeli tanks that begin to
surround this city so it will be
an already more dramatic phase probably
even that we saw so far for
What because Israel had done
to maximize the possibility of
that they die were Palestinian civilians in the
frame of this incursion was to move and
evacuate from north to the south to
civilians could operate with greater
Freedom in the north good now has
to go south because if it doesn't
To the south it will never be able to finish
of destroying never that he moved too
To the good south that will imply
surely different maneuvers are already
asking for partial evacuations of
Quadrants from one quadrant to another inside
of what is the south of the strip and
You will see then it is like the magnifying glass will return to
be on the civil impact that will
Almost search from these
Israeli attacks all this in the middle
of the paradox that Israel while
It is at war has a prime minister
that will be investigated for corruption
And that he will go to corruption trial
Things of the States of Law
just a prime minister at war
and that you will have to account for the
unthinkable justice in any of the
countries that are questioning Israel today
