I am Ashutosh Mishra at this time in Israel
As a city on ground zero which last night
Hamas rockets came under target
Thousands of rockets were fired and
The attack that has started from Saturday
Constant in many areas of Israel
Whether it is running and Ashkan is the area of Sedak
Ho and now you are looking behind me
He fell here last night when he fell here
The marks that have left almost everything is not destroyed
People who have home are coming now
To see things here
What is left and they are looking up
The whole part that is destroyed
It is a few people to stay inside
There are and you see here children
Women were also here and how much more
Dark mark has left and everything burnt above
The ashes have happened, nothing is left
The building almost got frozen and see like
We are talking suddenly in this
There are many voices coming from behind
Shells can be bomb shells or rocket shells
That is, the blasts here every 30 seconds
The voice of the voice comes but we have pictures you
Showing everything is almost burnt and
Clothes have burnt this entire part here
This entire building collapsed and you
Understand how much the rocket is
Powerful will be the hands of these terrorist organizations
It is felt and that is why the question is arising whether
all this
Some you are able to do this on their own
Seeing pictures of this demolition
Photos are everything broken in Akal Ila
There is nothing left, the whole building is almost
Has come down and still almost every 25
Between 30 seconds, only and only
The sound of blasts is heard by bus injured
Number of more and worrying is
That people who have been diacrites
How long has they been kidnapped
There are security agencies, she will take out
I am Ashutosh from Eskan Israel Ground Zero
Mishra today
till
