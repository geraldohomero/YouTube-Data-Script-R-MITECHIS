WHICH ICS BEEN UNDER SIEGE BY
RUSSIAN FORCES CLOSE TO A WEEK.
THERE IS A MASSIVE EFFORT BY THE
WEST TO SUPPLY UKRAINE WITH
WEAPONS TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS.
IT'S CLEARLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
ON THE GROUND.
SOME THOUSANDS OF ANTITANK
MISSILES TO STINGER MISSILES TO
SHOOT DOWN FIGHTER JETS AND
HELICOPTERS PLUS GRENADES,
SNIPER RIFLES, BULLETPROOF
VESTS, AMMUNITION.
UNITED STATES, CANADA, ALL PART
OF THIS EFFORT.
WEAPONS ARE BEING PRIMARILY
SHIPPED TO UKRAINE OVER LAND
FROM POLAND BUT THERE ARE
INCREASING CONCERNS RUSSIA WILL
START TO TARGET THE WEAPONS
SHIPMENT.
OUR CHIEF ANCHOR AT CTV NEWS AND
SENIOR NEWS EDITOR LISA LAFLAMME
IS STANDING BY IN POLAND AND HAS
MORE ON THAT STORY FOR US TODAY.
>> Reporter: WE ARE AT THE
LARGEST WAR CEMETERY IN KRAKOW
AND ONCE AGAIN POLAND FINDS
ITSELF AT THE CENTRE OF THIS
CONFLICT.
IT HAS BECOME THE LARGEST
INTERNATIONAL HUB FOR ALL OF
THAT MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT'S
MAKING ITS WAY INTO UKRAINE.
DEFENCE OFFICIALS WON'T SAY WHAT
AIRFIELD IS THE GATHERING POINT
FOR THIS EQUIPMENT.
OBVIOUSLY FOR SECURITY REASONS.
BUT WE CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS
WORKING AT BREAKNECK SPEED.
THEY ARE MOVING IN EVERYTHING
FROM ANTI-ARMOUR MISSILES TO
BODY ARMOUR.
THE AIRFIELD IS WORKING 17
FLIGHTS A DAY WHICH IS THE
CAPACITY OF THAT AIRFIELD.
IT'S A VERY TRICKY OPERATION
BECAUSE IF ANYTHING THEY'RE
CONCERNED THAT RUSSIA IS GOING
TO START TARGETING THOSE CONVOYS
OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT GOING IN.
IT'S ALL GOING IN BY ROAD.
THE SKIES OVER POLAND HAVE
BECOME SORT OF A SUPERHIGHWAY
FOR D17s WHICH IS THE BACKBONE
OF THE U.S. MILITARY AIR FLEET.
THEY'RE REPOSITIONING SOLDIERS
ALONG THAT BORDER.
THEY'RE COMING UP WITH TRANSFER
POINTS ALL IN AN EFFORT TO GET
IT INTO UKRAINE.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY HIGHLY
CHOREOGRAPHED ALLIED OPERATION,
BUT OF COURSE IT JUST CANNOT
HAPPEN FAST ENOUGH TO HELP
BOLSTER THE UKRAINIAN FORCES.
>> Todd: LISA LAFLAMME, CHIEF
NEWS ANCHOR, JOINING US FROM
POLAND.
THE OTHER IMPORTANT POINT
TALKING ABOUT POLAND, THE UNITED
STATES IS NOW CONSIDERING
ALLOWING THE POLES AND PERHAPS
THE ROMANIANS TO SENDS IN MiG
FIGHTER JETS TO THE UKRAINIAN
AIRFORCE TO HELP.
