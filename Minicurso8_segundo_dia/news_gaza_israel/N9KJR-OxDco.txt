[CC may contain inaccuracies] How much of this stage of the war is
planned and planned with intent by
Israel if it knows it's going to be
longer than the previous stage?
Does it have an idea of what the stage
will look like step by step and what the
next stage will be?
Well, according to several Israeli
officials, this next stage of the war
could last anywhere from six weeks to
six months.
It does indicate that Israel is moving
beyond any attempt to focus on the fate
of the hostages.
There are about 230 civilians who were
captured by Hamas and are being held in
Gaza.
Of course, there's a lot of pressure
domestically in Israel to get those
hostages back.
However, it now seems that Israel is
focusing on the next stage of the war,
which could last for as much as half a
year, according to Israel.
The U.S.
is focusing on just what Israel's aims
are.
Israel.
Israeli officials have said the goal
this time, unlike previous incursions
into Gaza, is not just to contain Hamas,
but actually to eliminate it as a threat
so that people could could return to the
areas of southern Israel that had been
attacked.
The United States has expressed concern
about just what the plan is at the end
of this incursion, at the end of the
invasion, if it lasts for six months, if
it lasts longer.
What's the plan after that?
And Bruce, you touch upon a couple of
these points and questions that people
were asking, given the brutality that
we've really seen in this conflict,
given
how escalated, I guess the aims on both
sides really are.
What does that mean for the humanitarian
crisis that's already unfolding?
And I guess the pressure that could come
from international allies and on
watchers in terms of how much can be
stomached on this in this aspect.
Yeah.
So the United Nations has said that the
humanitarian crisis is getting worse,
has said that its storehouses are
getting ransacked as civil order
falls apart in Gaza.
More than a million people in Gaza have
been displaced.
And that is a major concern for the
United Nations.
The U.S.
has
called on aid to be going in.
So how that can continue as the invasion
goes on, that is a big unanswered
question.
