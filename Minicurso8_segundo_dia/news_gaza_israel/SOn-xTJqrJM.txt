has never set foot in his homeland
but he holds on to his palestinian
identity
he was born in lebanon over the decades
the 51 year old has watched his fellow
palestinians
fight israeli occupation at first with
stones
and now with long-range rockets but he
says
the conflict now is a turning point in
their struggle
i won't say israel because this is our
land so i say palestinians living in
villages occupied since 1948
played a critical role the fact that
they have now revolted will hurt the
israelis
generations of palestinians have grown
up in exile descendants of many of those
who left or were expelled
during the 1948 palestinian israeli war
many have felt helpless and powerless as
they've
watched the deadliest violence in years
in the occupied palestinian territories
but at the same time they feel the
narrative
is changing recent events have
highlighted the underlying reasons
behind the repeated cycles of unrest and
violence
the fact that there is a people
oppressed
a lot has changed the world is reacting
there is support for the palestinians
people are seeing the injustices they
endure people know that there is an
occupation force they know we have a
cause
a cause that has not gone away the
latest violence was not confined to
gaza and palestinians in the west bank
occupied jerusalem
and across israel mobilized a few months
ago when we visited this camp the
feeling among palestinians was different
they had lost hope when some arab
countries signed normalization deals and
established ties with israel
the trump administration called it the
dawn of a new
middle east they now tell us the
palestinians who are resisting
are showing the world those accords
won't bring peace
to israel palestinians are not relying
on rulers
but the people who are filling the
squares from the united states
to arab countries to europe carrying the
palestinian flag will remain steadfast
our people will never accept to be
besieged or humiliated
axa is ours the attack on the aksa
mosque and attempts to drive more
palestinians from their homes in
jerusalem
triggered the latest round of violence
but the policy of expulsions
dates back to 1948. abu muhammad who is
