Of war began between Israel and Hamas
If you lift someone the most brunt
Israel and Palestine are falling if it is falling
Mango
Citizens will find such examples on both sides
That humanity groan
These pictures arose, Gaza is destroyed everywhere
It is a scene and now the citizens here
Stories of pain and pain are coming out
This person's name is Gajan Ala al Kafni
Such a sudden sorrow in his life
The mountain was broken, which is very much to guess
difficult
In this battle, Ghajan Ala al -Kaar Neh has his
Lost eight family members and now
He survived alone in his family
With the passage of time, then the body
The wounds of the wounds will heal but the pain of them
His family has got his tears due to losing his family
They are lifetime
Israeli will remain in the air strike
Then Neh gave his pregnant wife brother father
Two other members of the two cousin family
Lost
Diya Kafer says that Israeli Hawaii
Before being hit by the attack, he
Fled to two places with family and came here
Were but what did he know that his death
Not going to leave here too
Hai I give my father my brother my uncle
Cousin brothers your pregnant wife and two of the house
Other members have lost and now I
I am alone to leave the city
We got the message so
He went to destroy that building
Threatened in which we were, so we were beach camp
I went for security but the building
I was also in danger that we were in danger, so Sheikh
Had to go to Radwan city where we
Suddenly stayed in the apartment
There was an attack at 4 am and we don't know
Why we did nothing and just
This much
