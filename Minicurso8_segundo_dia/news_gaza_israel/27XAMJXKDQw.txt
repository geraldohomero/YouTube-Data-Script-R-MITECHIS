ADVISER, IS WITH US.
WE'LL SPEAK WITH HIM IN JUST A 
MOMENT.
FIRST TO JEFF PAUL WHO IS 
COVERING THIS LIVE BREAKING 
STORY FOR US FROM TEL AVIV.
HI, JEFF.
>> YEAH, MARTHA.
WE'RE WATCHING THE IMAGES RIGHT 
NOW AS WE WAIT FOR THOSE RED 
CROSS VANS AND VEHICLES TO CROSS
IN TO ISRAELI TERRITORY LIKE 
WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST THREE 
DAYS.
SO FAR NO CONFIRMATION OF THEM 
MAKING IT IN TO ISRAEL YET.
BUT THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.
LIKE WE'VE SEEN BEFORE, TODAY 
HAD A FEW DELAYS.
THIS SPEAKS TO HOW FRAGILE THIS 
DEAL IS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 
HAMAS.
NOT A LOT OF TRUST BETWEEN BOTH 
SIDES.
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE 11
RELEASED TODAY.
NINE OF THEM ARE KIDS.
THE TWO YOUNGEST JUST THREE 
YEARS OLD, ALMOST TWO MOMS IN 
THAT GROUP AS WELL.
JUST A DAY BEFORE, 14 ISRAELIS 
MADE THAT SAME JOURNEY WHERE 
THEY NOW JOIN 26 OTHER ISRAELIS 
RELEASED IN THE PREVIOUS DAYS.
THEY'RE ALL IN SOME SORT OF 
STAGE OF TREATMENT AND RECOVERY 
AFTER SPENDING ROUGHLY SEVEN 
WEEKS, SOME MORE THAN 50 DAYS 
LIKELY EXCLUSIVELY IN THE 
DARKNESS OF HAMAS TUNNELS.
HOWEVER, THERE'S STILL WELL-MORE
THAN 100 HOSTAGES THAT HAVE YET 
TO BE RELEASED BY HAMAS.
SO WE COULD SEE MORE BEING FREED
OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS AS QATARI
OFFICIALS BROKE THE NEWS A 
LITTLE WHILE AGO AGAINST 
EXTENDING THE TEMPORARY TRUCE.
ISRAEL HAS SAID THAT THEY WOULD 
EXTEND THE PAUSE IN FIGHTING BY 
ONE DAY FOR EVERY TEN ADDITIONAL
ISRAELI HOSTAGES RELEASED.
KEEP IN MIND, ONCE HAMAS STOPS 
RELEASING HOSTAGES, ISRAEL WILL 
START BACK THEIR OPERATIONS IN 
GAZA TO RESCUE THE REMAINING 
HOSTAGES.
>> WE WANT TO RECEIVE ANOTHER 
ADDITIONAL 50 HOSTAGES BEYOND 
TONIGHT ON OUR WAY TO BRINGING 
EVERYONE HOME.
AS SOON AS THAT FRAME WORK 
EXPIRES, ISRAEL WILL CONTINUE 
WITH FULL FORCE TOWARDS THOSE 
THREE OBJECTIVES.
ELIMINATING HAMAS, MAKING SURE 
THE GAZA STRIP CAN NEVER BE A 
SECURITY THREAT TO ISRAELI AND 
RELEASING ALL THE HOSTAGES.
>> WE KNOW MORE AID TRUCKS MADE 
IT IN TO GAZA TODAY AS WELL.
WE'RE AWAITING CONFIRMATION THAT
MORE THAN 30 PALESTINI
