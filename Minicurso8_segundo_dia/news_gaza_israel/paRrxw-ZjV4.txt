Gans Artillery Gansi's big Convoy
Looking back to me, look after me
Cameraman value will show you so much here
There is more sound because the gaz border
These tanks are being moved close to
Is towards the gaz band and this clear signal
Is that now a huge attack Israeli defense
Forces are planning you not one or two
Rather, see this other conveyance too
See you the cameraman value
The second conveyance is coming from there and that
We have Armard vehicles
You saw behind me that there were tanks and now
See away the infantry career vehicles away
See a little bit and we will show you further
See where the big convoy is coming from
These pictures of Israeli Defense Forces
Hamas is not just to threaten only
Not scared but also in action
Will be transformed and that's why they will first forward
But
Is being moved in deployed and closer
Move both as different conventions
Look at this, my cameraman honor you
We will show that we will have a conveyor infect
Will show that a conveyor from us right behind us
Going and one is running from our left side
There are two different conventions, see and
Understand that both are different
The convey you see on your TV screen
This tax conboy has been moving
And now my cameraman value will show you
That the one who is behind the tanks
Convoy is that Infantry Career
The vehicles are of both and it is both
They are clearly showing that now towards Gaza
A large number is being done here
Movement is being done from it is clear that
Now Israeli Defense Forces that Benjamin
Netanyahu gave a message that towards Gaza
All the citizens will move from now
Tanks are seen to come true
Infantry Career Vehicles
Armord
Career Armard Vehicles All of them all here
It is obvious that it is being moved from
Where is the information of its ahead, which position
But it will be forbidden to tell us
Is because military movement especially
Then when you are close to the border
Movement cannot be called a good
National Security Point of View and
That is why we will only be able to show you that
Right now the movement is being done in this way
We are very close to the gaz border
