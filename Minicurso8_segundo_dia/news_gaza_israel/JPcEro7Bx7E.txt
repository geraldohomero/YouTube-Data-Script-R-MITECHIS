Still in the diplomacy chapter this blow
of rear of re t lostot this Wednesday
The Turkish President attacked
Western in front of the parliament he
hypocritical judge and castigates
incessant bombardments of Israel on
Gaza we
[Applause]
Listen to Hamas is not a
band
terrorist is a group of
liberators and Mjahidin who
beat to protect their land and
their
citizen
Gr, that's for the rept position
Erdogan gen lebras hello we
find live from Istanul the
Turkish president also announces that he
cancels his visit projects in Israel
The standardization process is is
suspended
Yes we had the plan to go
in Israel but it is canceled we will not go
Not that's what Rchep said this morning
Tayip Perugan in front of the Turkish parliament
Since October 7, the chief of
the State and its training in power the CAP
Measure their support for the cause
Palestinian to avoid damaging their
Relations frankly restored
freshly restored forgiveness with the
Israeli authorities but today
The tone changes evoking his meeting
recent with the Prime Minister
Israeli Benyamin Netaniaou in
Last September in New York on
Turkish president said I tightened the
hand of this man we had good
intentions but he abused us in
this 58 -minute allowance which was
Retransmitted on Ret T television
Erdogan apart from elsewhere that the
Hamas was not an organization
terrorist is a patriotic group
which protects its territory and its people
he said a statement for which
He was largely applauded by the
Turkish deputies then it's a position
who is not really surprising
huh since we know Turkey
maintains close links with the
Hamas but it's true that she has an echo
particular today and especially
After Emmanuel Macron's statements
Yesterday during his visit to Jerusalem the
French president notably proposed
to extend the coalition
Islamic state anti -rganization
to fight against Hamas a
highly flammable proposition in
the region and strongly criticized by
specialists thank you very much for this
