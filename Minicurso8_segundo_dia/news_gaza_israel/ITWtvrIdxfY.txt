lifta is a rare architectural gem in
west jerusalem
it's the only historic palestinian
village left after the nakba or great
catastrophe of 1948.
when more than seven hundred thousand
palestinians were forced out of their
homes
jacob aude was born in lifta he was
eight when his family fled
israel prevents palestinians from
returning to reclaim their property
now he's 81 but audit still has found
memories of lifta
i'll never forget the home where i lived
as a child the stream and the orchard
where i spent my childhood this house
was so special to me the nightball
wasn't just about the demolition of
buildings is the demolition of life
economically politically culturally and
socially when you are uprooted from your
land and from your home the consequences
are indescribable they are unimaginable
alda says that back in 1948 40 000
people lived here
all became refugees
their houses stand abundant to this day
unesco has added lifter to a list of
protected locations ahead of declaring
it a world heritage site
despite these initiatives lifta is still
in danger the israeli land
administration is due to publish a
tender for a huge construction project
including hundreds of villas a hotel and
a shopping mall authorities have
promised to preserve the historic
buildings but some groups don't believe
them
a joint palestinian jewish initiator is
concerned a new luxury neighborhood will
erase the beauty of the village and its
heritage
save lifter has submitted a petition
calling for the cancellation of the
tender and plant development
i don't think they'll
destroy all the houses but we see in the
plan that their building is impossible
because if they build on the old houses
they'll have to build walls around each
house
and they
there was a very important survey of
their antiquity authority and they show
how liftor will look like
all
walls
uh these are very old and very special
houses and they should be preserved
auda says he and his family may have
left lifter 73 years ago but lifta has
never left them
