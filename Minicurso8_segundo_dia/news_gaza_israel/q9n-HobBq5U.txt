Sama Abu Safa left his home in wadel
sulka in central Gaza in his wheelchair
with his two
sons forced to flee in the middle of a
bombing campaign on roads turned to
Rubble was next to
Impossible assama is now in a un shelter
it's a school turned refuge for

hoping nothing happens we are struggling
to find her adult nappies since she
can't go to the toilet on her own due to
the Cross enclosures we cannot find them
anymore and if we do they are extremely
expensive medicines for long-term
