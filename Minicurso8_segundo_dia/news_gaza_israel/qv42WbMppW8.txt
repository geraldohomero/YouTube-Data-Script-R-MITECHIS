Yousef salaun has been hurting goats all
his life it's peaceful work but right
now it's fraught with
danger rockets and bullets are all
around us you don't know where they come
from yesterday we were boned we left the
goats without food and had to
leave but Yousef always comes back he
can't bear the thought of leaving his
animals to be bombed or eaten
if I leave to Beirut my her will
die I've been raising goats since I was
a little
boy like Yousef most of the people in
The Border Village of remesh make their
living on the
land tobacco is the main crop it's a
long process to bring it to harvest
after plowing this is the first phase a
nursery and while William grows
seedlings here accessing his plot of
land where the tobacco is replanted is
dangerous I have land on the border and
I don't dare to go there because I would
shortly die across the top of this
Valley you can see radio towers marking
Israeli bases towns like rumes are
surrounded by them the farmers who are
still working their land constantly hear
the rumbling of bombs and the hum of
Israeli drones you know raes is the only
Village that people are still Ines while
if you go east or west all people left
their Villages so up till now we can say
there is no agriculture no not any kind
of Agriculture not only tobacco and
these Villages if we look to the Future
it's a sad one tobacco is subsidized in
Lebanon and in the South it's the
lifeblood of many
villages Fields hit by Israeli shells
have been burned and in some cases
phosphorous bombs are believed to have
been used which spoiled the land uh it's
not only phosphorus you now we have a
problem problem of uh mines since 2006
cluster bombs in all Fields William
knows what these weapons do to the soil
his land was bombed in lebanon's last
war in 2006 when the conflict ended he
found his Fields had been
poisoned 30 cm tall plants would die
because of the bombs being used
phosphorus and other kinds if this war
escalates further there are fears all of
lebanon's South could be displaced and
with it a way of life that connects the
people to the land Randolph Nole trt
