between Israel and Palestine as an issue
Basically bipolar where there are two sides
marked because what has been done very

In fact through former contact with
Abas during which they coincided in
demand an immediate C to fire and
establishment of a humanitarian channel
of assistance to the population as well
as the restoration of legality

fulfill the mandate of the
consolidation of the Palestinian state to lo
that has some lines that can
draw certain parallels with what

initiatives promoted by different
countries about summoning a great
World conference in favor of peace
with the aim of stopping

civilians and advance on the way
definitive to the restoration of
