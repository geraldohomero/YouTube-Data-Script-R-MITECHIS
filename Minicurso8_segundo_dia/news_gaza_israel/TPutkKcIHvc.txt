US Secretary of State reached Israel
Anthony Blinkan Oil Avi has reached and
This is the second tour of Blinking in the midst of war
Even before this, Antony Blinkan came to Israel
Middle East is to visit Asian countries
There will be talks on war and hostages
It is being said that Antony Blinkan
Can also talk about hostages

I would like to come to you Shailendra sir
In 60 seconds, let us tell you that
Arabs of US Secretary of State from Israel from Israel
What is the indication to countries, what is the Arab country
They want to give hint because now said
It is being said that even with the hostages
They have reached Telv to talk
See this thing with great responsibility
Evaluate who 3:00 pm who
Talking about you know and the same day
Lincoln is coming here one in itself
It is a big indication that the US is still complete
Stands with Israel in a way
3:00 pm you declare War Declair at 6:00 pm
Your sleeping vein but Colonel Shailendra
A little change has come in America now
From the side of the bide, it should be said
It is now to Israel for a while
This war should stop on human basis
Israel is not ready for this Antony
If you are reaching Blinkon, it is going to go
Is this once again in front of Israel
Will propose that for a while now
Stop war, this is what we speak Tactical
Pose and tactical poses are why
That if there is a scope of development
He should be built up like this time
The atmosphere is visible on one side
Perhaps this is also due to this pressure
It is going on to leave the hostages and
Lara is giving Lappa
And the US is running soft on it
That somehow this hostage in the first step
Leave 7000 who stuck in citizens
You come out somehow and after that
You have to fight that you are seeing that
Iran is also creating the same atmosphere as
Israel is from
