 
>>> GO TO BRUSSELS NOW WHERE THE
FOREIGN MINISTERS ARE MEETING. 
>>> WE WERE ALL SHOCKED AFTER 
SEEING THE PICTURES AND VIDEOS 
OF THE EGREGIOUS EVENTS THAT 
HAPPENED IN IRPIN AS WELL AS IN 
BUCHA AND ELSEWHERE IN UKRAINE 
AND SO OF COURSE WE'LL RAISE 
THIS BEFORE NATO.
I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR
QUESTIONS.
>> Question: 
[ INAUDIBLE ]
>> Answer: WELL, THERE'S A LEVEL
OF INHUMANITY IN WHAT WE'VE SEEN
IN BUCHA, THAT FIRST AND 
FOREMOST CAN'T GO UNPUNISHED.
THAT'S WHY CANADA IS PETITIONING
THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.
WE NEED TO COLLECT EVIDENCE AND 
THE THOSE WHO COMMITTED THE WAR 
CRIMES MUST BE HELD TO ACCOUNT.
OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT 
UKRAINIANS ARE ABLE TO DEFEND 
THEMSELVES AND THAT WE'RE 
PUTTING MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON THE 
RUSSIAN REGIME.
SO BY MAKING WEAPONS AVAILABLE 
TO UKRAINIANS AND BY HAVING

COLLEAGUES MINISTER OF THE 
DEFENCE ON THIS.
AND MEANWHILE I MUST SAY, WE ON 
THE QUESTION OF SANCTIONS, SO WE
WELCOME THE SANCTIONS PACKAGE 
THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE 
E.U.
WE'LL CONTINUE TO COORDINATE 
WITH OUR EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES, 
YESTERDAY CANADA ANNOUNCED NEW 
SANCTIONS AND WE WILL IN THE 
COMING DAYS ANNOUNCE MORE 
SANCTIONS. 
>>> OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE 
THERE'S NO LOOPHOLES, THAT 
THERE'S COMPLETE UNITY AND HE 
THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE PUT A LOT 
OF PRESSURE, MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON
THE RUSSIAN REGIME. 
>>> AND I THINK THE OTHER THING 
ALSO I WANTED TO MENTION IS 
CANADA IS VERY SEIZED WITH WHAT 
HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND AND MY
DEPUTY MINISTER SO I INSTRUCTED 
MY DEPUTY MINISTER TO SUMMON THE
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IN OTTAWA TO 
MAKE SURE THAT
