HAMAS TO FREE THE HOSTAGES BUT
THE NEGOTIATORS SAY WHAT IS
NEEDED IS A CEASE-FIRE.
>> RICHARD ENGEL, THANK YOU.
AND OUR ELLISON BARBER HAS BEEN
THERE FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS
AND SHE IS NOW LIVE AT THE
ISRAEL/GAZA BORDER.
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING AND HEARING
ON THE GROUND TONIGHT?
>> Reporter: GABE, WE HAVE BEEN
IN THIS SECTION OF THE BORDER
JUST NORTH OF GAZA ALMOST FOR
THE ENTIRE TIME WE HAVE BEEN
HERE OVER TWO WEEKS WHAT WE
HAVE HEARD TONIGHT IS BY FAR
THE HEAVIEST AND MOST SUSTAINED
BOMBARDMENT INTO GAZA TO DATE.
WE HAVE HEARD JUST THE CONSTANT
SOUND OF BOOMS IN THE AREA
BEHIND US.
GAZA IS THAT DARK AREA JUST
BEHIND ME FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS
NOW.
AT DIFFERENT POINTS YOU WILL
SEE THE SKYLIGHT UP A
RED/ORANGE COLOR FROM INSIDE OF
GAZA.
AS YOU HEARD IN RICHARD'S
REPORTING THERE, ACCORDING TO
THE ISRAELI MILITARY A SPOABS
PERSON, IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT TILE
TIME 15 LOCAL TIME.
IT IS NOW 2:00 A.M.
THEY ANNOUNCED THEY WERE
EXPANDING THEIR GROUND
OPERATIONS INTO GAZA AT 8:30
LOCAL TIME THAT IS WHEN WE
STARTED HEARING REPORTS FROM
TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS
INSIDE GAZA SAYING THEY ARE
HAVE ENTIRELY LOST
COMMUNICATIONS, CALMS?
RED CROSS IS SAYING IT IS
CHALLENGING FOR THEM.
IT MEANS THE PRIMARY NUMBER 101
IT MEANS THE PRIMARY NUMBER 101
IS NOT WORKING AND AMBULANCES
ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY
RESPONDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO
WORK ON INJURED PEOPLE.
WORK ON INJURED PEOPLE.
FOR PEOPLES SOY, THE IDF HAVE
BEEN TELLING CIVILIANS TO
EVACUATE SOUTH.
THE QUESTION POSED FOR PEOPLE
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS IS WHAT
CHOICE REALLY DO PEOPLE HAVE?
THERE ARE STILL AIR STRIKES
GOING ON IN THE SOUTH THERE
HAVE BEEN BOMBINGS ALONG THE
MAIN HIGHWAY THAT LEADS TO THE
SOUTH.
THEY SAY PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD
TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES, THEY ARE
NOT SURE IT IS SAFE TO GO SOUTH
TO DRIVE THAT WAY.
THEY ARE NOT SURE IT IS SAFE
ONCE THEY GET THERE.
THERE IS NO OPTION TO LEAVE THE
GAZA STRIP ENTIRELY.
THEY ARE NOT SURE WHEN THEY
WILL BE ABLE TO COME BACK HOME.
CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN LEFT WITH
AN IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE INSIDE OF
GAZA.
TONIGHT THEY SAY THEY ARE
ENGAGING WITH ISRAELI FORCES ON
THE GROUND NEAR THE CITY WHERE
JUST A FEW MILES FROM THAT
HERE.
YOU CAN HEAR OVER HEAD SOME
SORT OF MILITARY JET IN THE
AIR.
WE HAVE CONSTANTLY HEARD THAT
TONIGHT.
MILITARY JETS, HELICOPTERS AND
DRONES IN ADDITION TO THE
