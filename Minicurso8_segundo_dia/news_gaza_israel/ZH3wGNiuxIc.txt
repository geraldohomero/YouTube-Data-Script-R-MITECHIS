here's what's happening at al-aqsa
mosque right now in jerusalem
hundreds of palestinian worshippers have
been tear-gassed attacked with
rubber-coated steel bullets
and arrested by israeli forces who
stormed the holy mosque during prayer
times
in an attempt to clear the compound
the red crescent says more than 170
people have been injured
with more than 80 transferred to
hospital for treatment and at least one
person in critical care
so how did all of this start
the city has been on edge all week over
the imminent eviction of six palestinian
families from their homes in the
neighborhood of sheikh jarrah
for days activists gathered to protest a
court-ordered removal of the families
and replacing them with israeli settlers
who had filed legal claims over the land
israeli police shut down the protests
and arrested dozens of activists
eventually blockading the entire
neighborhood to prevent any public
gatherings
on friday hundreds of thousands of
muslims from across
palestinian areas traveled to pray at
al-aqsa mosque
marking the final week of the holy month
of ramadan
following the prayers some worshippers
began chanting in support of sheikh
jarrah through the streets of the old
city
israeli police responded quickly
violently dispersing crowds that
included women and children
with sound grenades and rubber-coated
steel bullets
when people were treated to al-aqsa
compound which sits at the heart of the
old city
israeli police entered and attempted to
clear the area that still contained
thousands of palestinians
videos that emerged from the night
showed grenades thrown at worshipers as
they prayed
and several areas including al-majid
al-qibli were tear-gassed while people
were trapped inside
many hid inside alux mosque where they
remained trapped for hours
as israeli police cut electricity lines
to force them to evacuate
emergency services are still trying to
assess the injuries
and were still calm to the civilians
still coming to grips with what happened
palestinian president mahmoud abbas has
demanded an emergency session at the u.n
security council
over what he calls disgusting and sinful
acts
and al-aqsa and shaykh zarah palestinian
civil society has called for a day of
anger on saturday
in response to an unprecedented
crackdown at one of the holiest sites of
islam
during its holiest month
