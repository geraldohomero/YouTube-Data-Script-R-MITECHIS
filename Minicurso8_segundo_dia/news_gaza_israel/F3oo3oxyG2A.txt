in an effort to curb the rising cases of
the delta variant
israel has now launched its covert
booster shot campaign
to allow the above 60 population to get
an additional third
dose israel launched the campaign to
give fisa booster jabs to people aged
60 and above in the hope of increasing
their protection against covert 19.
it makes israel the first country to
offer a third dose of a western vaccine
to its citizens on a large scale the
booster campaign is expected to
effectively turn israel into a testing
ground
for a third dose
i feel excellent i also felt very good
after the
first two vaccinations and if we'll need
a force vaccination
also no problem it's such a small thing
and
and and again i think the fact that we
can have the vaccinations
is is just a huge right that we get
and we should use it israeli president
isaac herzog received the third shot of
coronavirus maxine on friday
kicking off the campaign on the eve of
the booster rollout israeli prime
minister naftali bennett said that
israel has already given
2 000 immunosuppressed people the third
dose with no severe adverse events
israel launched one of the world's most
successful vaccination drives earlier
this year with over 56 of its 9.3
million people
vaccinated with two doses of covered
vaccine
meanwhile britain is also set to offer
covered booster vaccines to 32 million
britons
starting early next month according to
reports
the shots will be available in as many
as 2 000 pharmacies
with the goal of getting them into arms
by early december
according to reports pharmacies will be
at the forefront of the vaccine program
so the doctors and nhs staff can focus
on the growing backlog
of patients awaiting other treatments
so far the uk has fully vaccinated
nearly 58 percent of its population
like israel many middle eastern
countries including bahrain
are already offering booster shots to
vaccinated individuals
the indonesian doctors association has
called on the government to green light
booster shots for healthcare workers
media reports suggest that thailand is
also considering giving booster shots
for frontline workers
china meanwhile is also studying whether
it is necessary to give additional doses
to vulnerable groups
and high-risk workers in order to boost
immunity
