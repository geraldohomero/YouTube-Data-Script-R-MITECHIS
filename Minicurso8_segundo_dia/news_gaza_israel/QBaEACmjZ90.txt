With this on the table if you allow me
I'm going to jump to the other side I will jump to
GAZA I will return to that plane in which
Israel continues to attack hard from
Then the positions in Gaza say that
is about to destroy
Never and the objective changes just
Benjamin say
Netanyahu warning Aol warning
Labano that they don't want to have said
You will not want to see converted
Beirut in another gaza
I just said, I think the threat
It is evident says that if they continue
bombing from the south of Israel the
Sorry the north of Israel the south of
Lebanon is to say that part of the border
that both share that they will be seen
forced to also take actions a lot
beyond responding with rockets from
The other side of the border is to say an eye
eye because we had said so far the
thing is staying in the strip of
Gaza eh is true that I was having
confrontations with the rebels jí if
We want to call them like this in the part of
Yemen is seeing them in Lebanon is
Seeing with the Iraqi militias the
is seeing there have been many
clashes but get to the point of
that directly the president of Israel

Your capital in the same thing that has
happened to Gaza I don't know how you value this
type of interventions eh I already tell you what
He just said in an interview and me
A declaration of
intentions if, how does it happen
They continue bombing that I don't think Xitola
Go to stop eh the rocket shots
I do not say that it will go further but

Border for the moment does not seem to go
