ARE SEEING SOME DELAYS THERE
THOUGH. RIGHT NOW 22 MINUTES.
IS YOUR COMMUTE THERE BETWEEN
US, ONE BALTIMORE AVENUE AND
GEORGIA AVENUE.
>> LET'S TURN TO OUR TOP STORY
THIS MORNING. DEVELOPING IN THE
DISTRICT. AN INVESTIGATION
UNDERWAY AFTER A MAN SET
HIMSELF ON FIRE OUTSIDE OF THE
ISRAELI EMBASSY.
>> AND FOX NEWS CONFIRMS THAT
THAT MAN IS A MEMBER OF THE US
AIR FORCE. FOX FIVE'S MELANIE
IS LIVE THIS MORNING OUTSIDE OF
THE ISRAELI EMBASSY IN
NORTHWEST, WITH THE LATEST
DETAILS. MELANIE. GOOD MORNING.
>> HEY. GOOD MORNING AND WE
STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
PLANNING WENT INTO THIS AND WHY
THE YOUNG MAN TRAVELED HERE. WE
BELIEVE THAT HE IS FROM TEXAS.
THOSE DETAILS NOT YET CONFIRMED
BY D.C. POLICE OR THE US SECRET
SERVICE, BUT IT WAS HERE JUST
PAST THE FLAGS AND PHOTOS OF
REMEMBRANCE THAT HAVE BEEN HUNG
OUTSIDE THE ISRAELI EMBASSY,
WHERE THAT MAN CAME WALKING
DOWN THE HILL AROUND 1:00 ON
OF THE SIDE GATES. THERE HE
POURED HIMSELF, DOUSED HIMSELF
WITH A LIQUID FROM A CONTAINER,
SOME OF THE RESPONSE FROM THE
D.C. POLICE DEPARTMENT.
>> THIS CALL. WE JUST GOT A MAN
ON FIRE OUTSIDE. FIND A PERSON
BURNED, SET HIMSELF ON FIRE,
EMBASSY OF ISRAEL.
>> NOW, IN THE VIDEO THAT WAS
LIVE STREAMED, THIS YOUNG MAN
IDENTIFIES HIMSELF AS AARON
BUSHNELL, AN ACTIVE DUTY AIR
ABOUT TO UNDERGO AN EXTREME
FORM OF PROTEST. HE COULD BE
HEARD YELLING FREE PALESTINE AS
HE BURST INTO FLAMES AND THEN
FELL TO THE GROUND. US SECRET
SERVICE AND DC POLICE RAN TO
HELP WITH FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
AND EMERGENCY KITS BEFORE
RESCUE CREWS ARRIVED, AND THERE
WERE ALSO SOME TENSE MOMENTS
HERE ON SCENE, AS NO ONE ELSE
ELSE TO COME AFTER THE FIRE WAS
OUT AND THE MAN TRANSPORTED TO
DC POLICE HAD THEIR EXPLOSIVE
ORDNANCE DISPOSAL TEAM CHECK
OUT A NEARBY VEHICLE. THE CAR
WITH TEXAS PLATES WAS TOWED
AWAY. NOW, THE ISRAELI EMBASSY
SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT THERE
WERE NO INJURIES TO STAFF AND
EVERYBODY IS SAFE. D.C. FIRE
AND EMS HAVE NOT YET TO US
UPDATED THE MAN'S CONDITION
THIS MORNING, THOUGH WE CAN
TELL YOU EXTREMELY LIFE
THREATENING INJURIES. IN FACT,
HARD TO SEE HOW ANYBODY COULD
SURVIVE THAT. WE'VE ALSO BEEN
WORKING TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO
ASCERTAIN THE VALIDITY OF SOME
VIDEO THAT WE'VE SEEN, AND YOU
MAY HAVE SEEN SOME OF IT ON
SOCIAL MEDIA AND WORKING TO
REACH OUT TO THE FAMILY OF THIS
