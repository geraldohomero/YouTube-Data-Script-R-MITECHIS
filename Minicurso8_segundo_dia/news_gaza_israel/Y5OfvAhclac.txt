we're going to cross two jerusalem speak
to our correspondent iris mackler
who joins us from there iris the
violence then has continued uh in the
air
overnight as we heard there but it seems
quieter so far anyway in jerusalem
itself
quieter in jerusalem but the rocket
attacks from the gaza strip into israel
continuing this morning and uh we have
seen
um israel closing schools within a 40
kilometer radius opening bomb shelters
you can see that even though iron dome
they say
has intercepted 90 of the rockets from
gaza
uh they're taking this seriously and
they may actually be hunkering down for
another
round as they call it here and that
hunkering down on both sides
is that likely to um change do you think
that the quietness uh
so far in jerusalem as the day goes on
in jerusalem i i don't think it's likely
to remain quiet it wasn't quiet last
night and what's interesting is it's
extended
from uh the actual al-aqsa mosque
compound
from the damascus gate to the suburbs
and the areas
surrounding that in east jerusalem we
saw it extending across israel
in the north in haifa in the south in
the bedouin areas
we saw pitched battles between citizens
in a mixed city called lod not far from
tel aviv
we saw also um we saw things going on in
the palestinian territories in the west
bank
so it's it's an escalation it's across
the area
it's outside of israel as well we saw
protests in turkey
in jordan in morocco in lebanon so
this is um it's you know it's in the
rising phase
and you might think looking at it when
you see the
incredible firepower and the capacity
for destruction that israel has
in the gaza strip it's hard to believe
that this is an initiative of hamas but
it is it suits hamas's
political aims the aims of its militant
wing which seems to be
have the upper hand at the moment and i
don't know how long it'll go on the eid
as at the end of the week that's the end
of ramadan perhaps things will calm down
by then
but i don't anticipate something
immediate
sadly much aries our correspondent
joining us there from jerusalem thanks
very much
