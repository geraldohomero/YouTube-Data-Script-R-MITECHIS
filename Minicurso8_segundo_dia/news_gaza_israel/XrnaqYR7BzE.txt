FOX SEVEN AUSTIN NEWS IS ON YOUR
SIDE WITH JOHN KRANJAC. WELCOME
BACK TO THE ISRAELI MILITARY.
SAYS IT HAS WITHDRAWN ITS GROUND
FORCES FROM A REGION IN SOUTHERN
GAZA. THIS, AS TODAY, MARKS
EXACTLY SIX MONTHS SINCE THE
OCTOBER 7TH MASSACRE. FOX IS.
TREY YINGST HAS MORE. THAT'S
RIGHT. IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS
SINCE THE OCTOBER 7TH MASSACRE.
WE SAT DOWN WITH ONE WOMAN WHO
WAS RELEASED AS PART OF THE
NOVEMBER CEASEFIRE DEAL. SHE
DESCRIBES WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE AS
A HOSTAGE AND ALMOG GOLDSTEIN, I
AM HEN ALMOG GOLDSTEIN. AND FOR
THE PAST THREE YEARS I'VE LIVED
IN KIBBUTZ KFAR AZA. NADAV, MY
HUSBAND, THEY SHOT HIM AT POINT
BLANK RANGE IN THE CHEST. THERE
WERE 2 OR 3 GUNSHOT WOUNDS, I
REMEMBER, AND HE WAS LYING ON
THE FLOOR LIKE THAT QUIETLY. I
REMEMBER HIM WITH HIS LEGS
FOLDED AND LYING QUIETLY AND
STRAIGHT AWAY. THERE WERE FIVE
TERRORISTS INSIDE THE MOHAMMAD.
THE SAFE ROOMS WITH WEAPONS,
OPENING THE CLOSET THERE AND
TELLING US TO GET DRESSED. WE
WERE NAKED, WE WERE IN OUR
PAJAMAS AND THEY DEMANDED THAT
WE DRESS UP. WHAT'S GOING
THROUGH YOUR MIND IN THAT
MOMENT? SHOCK. TERRIBLE FEAR,
FRIGHT AND SHOCK. WE GOT OUT IN
A LINE. THE BOYS WERE ALREADY
GOING OUT, AND THEN YAM FOLLOWED
. BEFORE THAT, ONE OF THE
TERRORISTS SAW YAM'S UNIFORM
SHIRT. HE OPENED IT LIKE THAT. I
REMEMBER HIS BIG GREEN EYES AND
HE SCREAMED AT ME IN ARABIC. AND
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S
ASKING ME. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE
DRIVEN INTO GAZA WITH YOUR
CHILDREN. WHAT ARE THOSE FIRST
FEW HOURS AND DAYS LIKE SHIVA?
TO GAZA AND SEVEN WEEKS TO
RETURN. WHEN WE CAME BACK FROM
GAZA, THE UNBEARABLE EASE OF HOW
IT ALL HAPPENED WAS UNBEARABLE
REACHED THE TUNNEL. WE WERE
THERE FOR TWO DAYS. WHAT WERE
THE INTERACTIONS WITH HAMAS LIKE
WHEN YOU WERE HELD IN THESE
LOCATIONS? OWNS BOTH AN ABSURD
ACTUALLY IN AN ABSURD WAY. THEY
GUARDED US, PROTECTED US,
SOMETIMES EVEN WITH THEIR BODIES
FROM THE ISRAELI AIR FORCE
STRIKES. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
ABSURDITY. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
ABSURDITY SEVERAL TIMES. AND
THEY ALSO MADE SURE TO POINT IT
OUT, LIKE, WE PROTECT YOU FROM
THE AIR FORCE ATTACK. THAT IS
THE WORD ABSURDITY. THE REASON
HAMAS WANTED TO KEEP THESE
HOSTAGES SAFE IS TO EXCHANGE
THEM AS PART OF A LARGER
CEASEFIRE DEAL FOR PALESTINIAN
