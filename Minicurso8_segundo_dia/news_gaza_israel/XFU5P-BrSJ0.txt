Changera Alicia Barcena had yesterday
His first appearance in office was
Before the Senate on the occasion of the gloss
From the fifth government report the issue
central was the conflict between Israel and
They never know you a week ago
and a half a new conflict exploded after
The attack on Israel by ever
We condemn
unequivocally these attacks we advocate
For dialogue and peace the aggression to
civilian population by any
Conflict actor must be denounced
Because it is a flagrant violation of
International Law and Transgression
to human rights our position
is clear because even war has
Rules is also essential that there is no
The slightest doubt that politics
Mexican exterior
reject any type of action
Terrorist I think that in the face of violence
there can be no ambiguities
There can be no false neutrality and
There must always be a condemnation
rapid and unequivocal we must fight
fans are where they are in a
Loom fugitive in a match
politician in a government position in a
synagogue in a Christian temple or in a
Mosque you have done very well
So while we are eh
condemning definitively condemning the
Terrorist attack never too
We are defending the life of the
civilian population according to law
International I speak after
Mexican citizens who have not been
located that is ilana screamwsky and
Orion Hernández like you
They will understand these negotiations or
communications we have because they are what
that I would call silent diplomacy
and of enormous discretion because we cannot
put them at risk precisely to these
Hostages we also have the problem or
Bárbara Lango theme that you know
that this is a doctor who worked in
doctors without borders or working in
doctors without borders who are in the
Gaza and Egypt border and there
We are seeing that at the time
The humanitarian corridor opens
Surely it will be one of the first
people who are going to get her out
Together with Michelle Rabel we are
doing everything that is in
our hands to guarantee
security of our
Connationals The theme is runner
humanitarian has not yet been
[Music]
open
