neighbors israel and jordan have not had
the best of relations
several issues divide them but now the
two seem to be cooperating on a common
agenda climate change
at stake is a shared resource
the jordan river
off late the water levels in the river
have been declining this coincides with
a growing population and increased
demand for water in the arid
region
unlike what some had predicted israel
and jordan are actually coming together
to tackle the crisis
this region is the most water scarce
region in the world the middle east
north africa
with climate change
things are going to get well things are
already getting a hell of a lot worse
so if there's something that the
governments of israel jordan and the
palestinian authority
agree on today is that climate change is
happening and climate change threatens
each country's
water security
and national security
this is not the first such cooperation
between the two countries
in fact bilateral talks on water
predated the israel jordan peace deal in
1994
they even continued when the countries
were officially at war
so what made some experts warn of a
water war in west asia
relations between the neighbors declined
significantly under former israel prime
minister benjamin netanyahu critics
accused him of neglecting jordan as he
embarked on improving ties with other
nations in the region
but things are changing under
netanyahu's successor naftali bennett at
the center of this change is israel's
plan to shift to solar energy
the problem is that israel does not have
enough solar power plants
but it can still buy solar energy from
jordan
harnessing the sun and the sea
between israelis palestinians and
jordanians as a means to combat
the climate crisis and build climate
resilience
will mean more water in every person's
home throughout this region sustainable
energy at cheapest prices
it's a sort of a barter system
israel can buy energy from jordan while
the latter can get a larger share of
river water
