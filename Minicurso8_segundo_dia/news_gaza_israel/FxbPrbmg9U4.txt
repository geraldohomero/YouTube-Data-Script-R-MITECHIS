THE PENTAGON CONTINUES TO BE ON
HIGH ALERT IS IRAN LAUNCHES A
MISSILE ATTACK ON ISRAEL.
U.S. FORCES WORKING IN FORMATION
WITH ISRAEL TO SHOOT DOWN SOME
OF THOSE DRONES.
DOZENS OF DRONES, ACTUALLY.
ISRAELI FORCES A FEW MOMENTS CUP
SAYING MOST OF THE DRUMS WERE
INTERCEPTED OUTSIDE OF ISRAEL'S
BORDER.
JOINING US NOW, NATIONAL
SECURITY CORRESPONDENT JENNIFER
GRIFFIN WITH THE LATEST FROM THE
PENTAGON, WHAT YOU GOT?
>> REGISTERED DRONES HAVE BEEN
SHUT DOWN AS WE'VE REPORTED HE
WAS OFFICIALS TELL US THE U.S.
MILITARY HAS SHUT DOWN DOZENS OF
ONE-WAY ATTACK DRONES OUTSIDE OF
ISRAELI AIRSPACE BUT ALSO
BALLISTIC AND CRUISE MISSILES.
WE'VE LEARNED U.S. MILITARY
ASSETS IN THE REGION HAVE BEEN
USED TO INTERCEPT SOME OF THOSE
HOLISTIC AND LAND ATTACK CRUISE
MISSILES WE WERE REPORTED IN THE
LAST HOUR OR FIRE FROM IRAN SO
THAT MEANS IRAN FIRED NOT JUST
DRONES BUT ALSO BALLISTIC AND
CRUISE MISSILES.
WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT IS THE U.S.
MILITARY ENGAGED AT LEAST ONE OF
THOSE BALLISTIC MISSILES IN A
MANNER THAT PROTECTED ISRAEL SO
U.S. NAVY, U.S. AIR FORCE,
CENTRAL COMMAND, VERY BUSY
TONIGHT ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST.
WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE JORDANIAN
AIR FORCE AND MISSILE DEFENSE
SYSTEMS VERY BUSY TONIGHT,
THEY'VE ENGAGED.
I'VE BEEN TOLD DOZENS OF IRANIAN
DRONES PASSING THROUGH THEIR
AIRSPACE.
IDF HAS BEEN CLEAR MOST OF THE
DRONES AND MISSILES WERE
DESTROYED AND INTERCEPTED
OUTSIDE ISRAELI AIRSPACE, GOOD
NEWS FOR ISRAEL AND SHOWS THE
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX LAYERED
MISSILE DEFENSE AND AIR ASSETS
EMPLOYED TO ENGAGE NOT JUST
THESE MISSILES AND DRONES BUT
ALSO WE ARE TOLD AIRCRAFT% BY
HOSTILE AIRCRAFT SENT TOWARD
ISRAEL AND THEY WERE ALL
INTERCEPTED, WE ARE TOLD SO A
LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE SKIES
OVER THE MIDDLE EAST TONIGHT BUT
WE ARE GETTING GOOD SCIENCE FROM
THE IDF TELLING ISRAELIS THEY NO
LONGER NECESSARILY BE IN SHELTER
SO THIS FIRST WAVE OF ATTACKS
APPEARS TO BE WINDING DOWN BUT
WE ARE TOLD THE U.S. MILITARY
AIRCRAFT ARE STILL IN THE SKIES
PATROLLING, ENSURING ISRAEL IS
