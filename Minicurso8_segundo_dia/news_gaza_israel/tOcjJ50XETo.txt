I am present at this time of the border
About 3 km away and from here
No man land is all the vehicles you have
All these vehicles are watching from behind
Either the army or the logistics to the army
To deliver goods to deliver
To deliver intelligence or
Going to carry soldiers
All these are government vehicles, see
Whom the lights blink in front of them
In some way, some army or or the other
Then police personnel are posted in front
See the opening and closure of the gaz border
The time is also written that from Sunday
Tharsde means Sunday to Thursday and this
The sound of blasts keeps coming here continuously
Is because Gaza is very close from here
Strip of about three to 4 kilometers
It is being told and the army ahead of it
The man is not letting go because further
The whole battleground is here I am telling
It was that from 7:30 am to 9 am
From 3:30 pm to 4:30 pm in the evening
The rest of the border is given time to come
The intersection you are looking at is watching
Are
In front of him, a green color sign board
The last limit is written on this and 4
See this kilometer visible
All the tanks are coming all the vehicles
Eleven have been sent from here and if further
Obviously, if you get permission to go
Is that we will go there to our audience
Will also tell what kind of movement there is
But the final moment of Gaza Strip from here
It is happening and here we all the time
About to give updates
Will stay
