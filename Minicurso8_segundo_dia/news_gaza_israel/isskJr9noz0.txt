people all around them screaming out for
help and nobody's there and just
terrorists and everyone was thinking it
will be two
rockets but in 45 minutes there has been
over than 150 Rockets now it's it's a
war it's a new
[Music]
war
we are used for a
rocket and then artillery airplanes
suddenly we start to hear here
guns machines and then we have seen the
trucks that's and the motor bikes and we
start to understand what is happening
that they are
not H shooting far away that they are
inside and they start to kidnap and to
kill and they take over the police
station at the
road take
hostages it's completely different it's
a
w you know we don't sleep at night uh I
I don't believe that we are in this
situation nobody ever believed that it
could be so worse we don't have what to
do with time all the time thinking about
that stuff so it's easier to be here and
to work and to do something just that
the people that hurt that it will be a
little bit easier for
[Music]
them they were not allowed to speak
so it's not to be heard outside so that
no one will know that they're here
during all this time the terrorists were
in the kibuts invading homes killing
innocent
people it was a mass care I don't have a
strong enough word to describe the fear
it's that I felt for them I can't even
try start to imagine how they felt just
being in this small room closed
room nobody there
people all around them screaming out for
help and nobody's there and just a
[Music]

something like 700 people but a lot of
people you know all the family comes
here and they tell us that they don't
