There is no food aid that is
spent for a long time and there is a
power cut and water cut and
and the life where the how
To say human life in general is
Arrested I can give I can
tell you that what's going on
today it's a bit it's gasgrade
We are surrounded and we have no water
drinking we don't have water we don't
electricity and the aliens they are they
They started to bomb all
generators that it is
In hospitals in schools
banks bakes so there is
Nothing to eat in Gaza me more
Stay with me that's a few it's
Some cookies for my little water
drinking it's almost we are just he
Stay two Jericales and Uh and in addition
I am a little spoiled because we have
A little flour with us and my wife
it does a little bread at
So we can spend life with a
little bread and we have something that
is called Zatar or Thint is okay
it can work with that but the problem
problem is rather the displaced
moved who are in schools that
are in hospitals I can say that
it's been more than 5 days they don't have
tasted a task of bread is it is
it's panic it's really the
panic people they said we have
excavated searched the north towards because
that they bombed the entire district of
from Bet Hanoun and they came to Gaza
There is no sure place we
believed that in hospitals and it is
the safe place they understood that it is
not a safe place and go to
the south as the the Israelis they
say or the occupation army
They say we have to go south I
don't know if you saw how it has
There are convoys that has been bombed
especially convoys of the wounded who has
been bombed you imagined
ambulances that have been targeted by
the army and it is these ambulances it
must have an agreement to do so
Pass towards Egypt so there is no
There are a lot of people who want to go
go south because they say
that it's a little safer and it's not
It's not at all true
