Israel has a genocidal intent against
the Palestinians in
Gaza that is evident from the way in
which Israel's military attack is being
conducted Israel's response to the 7th
of October 2023 attack has crossed this
line and give rise to the brides of the
convention the intent to destroy Gaza
has been nurtured at the highest levels
of
State

against this background I move now to
demonstrate in turn how Israel's conduct
violates articles 2
a 2 b 2 C and 2D of the
convention the first genocidal act
committed by Israel is the mass killing
of Palestinians in Gaza in violation of
article 2A of the genocide convention
Israel's special genocidal intent is
rooted in the belief that in fact the
enemy is not just the military wing of
Hamas or indeed Hamas generally but is
embedded in the fabric of Palestinian
life in
Gaza
to die a slow death because of
starvation and
dehydration or to die quickly because of
a bomb attack or
snipers but to die nevertheless
in fact Heritage Minister Amai
El said that Israel must find ways for
Gins that are more painful than
death it is no answer to say that
neither are in command of the army they
are ministers in the Israeli government
they vote in the knesset and are in a
position to shape State
policy the intent to destroy Gaza has
been nurtured at the highest levels of
[Music]
State
for the past 96 days Israel has
subjected Gaza to what has been
described as one of the heaviest
conventional bombing campaigns in the
history of Modern
Warfare
no armed attack on a state territory no
matter how serious even an attack
involving atrocity crimes can provide
any justification for or defense to
breaches to the convention whether as a
matter of law or
morality Israel's response to the 7th of
October 2023 attack has crossed this
line and give rise to the bridges of the
convention
