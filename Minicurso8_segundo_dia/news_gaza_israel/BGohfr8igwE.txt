And we are heading to November of the year 2024
With the presidential elections in the
The United States we told you just
that Mike Pence got off who was the
Vice President of Donald Trump in the
past management of the Republican Party and
Now we are going to tell you a statement
that has just had the leader
just from the party promised to return to
prohibit the entry of Muslims to
The United States if you manage to win the
elections in November of the year
2024
In this way the conflict in the middle
East has a strong presence in
the concerns that today travel
state
United for which the former president
included this issue in the campaign
electoral for the elections
presidential in this framework and before a
audience of Jewish members of their
Republican party proposed that
prohibit the entry of Muslims to
country
North American we listen
Something that is saying of the group
we will never keep the
radical Islamic terrorists outside
our country at this annual summit of the
Republican Jewish coalition that has been
Made in the city of Las Vegas
Remember the prohibition of traveling the
First day I will restore our
prohibition of traveling this Donald
Trump remember that at the beginning of the
Presidency in 2017 the tycoon
restricted the entry of travelers who
They came from Iran de Libya from Somal√≠ from
Syria of Yemen and initially Irac and
Sudan all countries mostly
Islamic and the order was quickly
challenged in court
considered in that instance
Discriminatory against a group
Religious however prisons
Next to the anti -immigration agenda of
Donald Trump had great echo among their
supporters like this we see the
Algarabia the genuine response of
audiences present but later the
President Joe Biden of the party
Democrat repealed that measure just
The mandate of the year 2021 began a
Theme then that has close history
And that it could be presented already one of
The central axes of the campaign
Donald Trump's presidential Rumbo
So what are going to be
ELECTIONS OF THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER OF THE YEAR
