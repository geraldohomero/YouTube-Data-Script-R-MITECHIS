Can you just give us the current state
of play, where things stand right now?
Well, you've all expressed there pretty
well where there are 300,000 guys in
uniform waiting on the border.
They have set up this base.
They are a little stretched for equipment.
They say the U.S.
is filling it in.
But it does feel like we are but days
away from a major land invasion.
It's impossible to imagine them trying
to carry out what they claim they want
to do, which is to end Hamas's ability
ever to do what they did on Saturday
again, without such a sort of house to
house kind of invasion.
So I think that, you know, Marcos,
certainly everything is going to start
going relatively crazy once that
happens.
And then there's the other factor, which
is might Hezbollah in Lebanon join in?
There was a warning from Iran today that
Israel needs to not do what it's doing
in Gaza.
Ethan, you are exceptionally experienced
with this.
Your work at The New York Times on al
Qaeda.
20 some years ago.
I'm fascinated how you perceive Israel's
perception of Hamas is a terror group.
Is it a specific group?
Is it an entity or is it a band of
thugs?
What's the character that Israel
perceives?
Hamas.
Hamas, A fascinating question.
And the reason it's so interesting is
that Israel's view of Hamas shifted
dramatically three days ago or on
Saturday.
Before that, there was originally it was
seen as a group of thugs.
Then they came they for six years they
have been ruling in Gaza, in Gaza, and
they have actually been negotiating with
Israel.
There have been 18,000 Gazans who've
been working in Israel.
That requires negotiation and
interaction with the Israeli officials
and letting in all kinds of stuff.
So there was a sense that actually it
was becoming a more responsible, normal
kind of ruling organization.
Meanwhile, this just happened and it is
now viewed as a group of ISIS like or
worse than thugs.
The words that are used here are hardly
worth repeating, but animals and so
forth, because there really was just an
open slaughter of women, children and at
the innocents on Saturday in a way that
is a little hard to understand.
