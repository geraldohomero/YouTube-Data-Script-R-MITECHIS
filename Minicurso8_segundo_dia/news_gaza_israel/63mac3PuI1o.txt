have you again Israel
Keep fighting in Gaza and has
Increased its hostilities with Hezbollah
In Lebanon how serious the situation in
The border increases fear of a
more conflict
Broad nights Silvia really
The possibilities of a conflict with

scenario that would be really unfortunate
It is necessary to remember that in 2006
They faced Israel's forces and
Hisbol for just over a month and in that
Then there were no defenses
anti -aircraft as an iron dome that
There are today in Israel and there are
What to say that Hizb is by far more
powerful that never has 100,000
very well trained men with
Experience in Combat in War
