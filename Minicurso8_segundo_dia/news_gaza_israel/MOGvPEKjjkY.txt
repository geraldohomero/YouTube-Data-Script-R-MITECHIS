had been covering the conflict in gaza
for years
but in 2014 the story hit too close to
home
it was july and israel had launched
operation protective edge in kudai's
hometown
when the israeli force is invaded people
have tried to contact me via phone calls
or messages people were pleading for
help telling us that massacres were
taking place in the town i tried to
alert the red cross and the ambulance
teams but it was in vain people were
telling me the names of the victims and
the injured but i couldn't do anything
except report the details
the assault followed an earlier mission
to track down and arrest hamas
operatives for allegedly kidnapping and
killing three israeli teenagers
from the beginning of the operation we
promised to return israel to peace and
we will continue to act until that aim
is achieved and we will exert as much
force as needed
the brunt of that force was felt in
towns like kuza by people like kudai and
ashraf al-qura
kura runs a business in khuzha and was
present when the israeli offensive began
when we were besieged in ghosa we were
told to stay at our homes then the
israelis raided the region we had
children old men and women with us the
bombing started over us our neighbor's
house was bombed and our home received
damage so we were forced to leave the
area
while kora and his family were able to
escape others were not so lucky
later could they manage to track some of
them down
where i'm standing right now there are
many martyrs bodies i recognize five of
them one of them is a relative of mine
his name is abdul wale kadai his body
was completely mutilated
this is from here
despite international condemnation and
calls from the u.n the israeli offensive
lasted for seven weeks
today gardens say that while they have
rebuilt much of the infrastructure the
psychological scars remain
shoebhasan trt world
