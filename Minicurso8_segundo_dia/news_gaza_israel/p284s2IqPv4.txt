then the Israeli army is concentrated
In
the day that would according to her be the
Bastion of Hamas leaders
Especially around the city of Ranunnes
But war enters a new
phase the Israeli army has announced
that she was going to withdraw at least three
Brigades are 20,000 men from the band
of Gaza to prepare for a war
much longer to operations at
long -term commando operations which
are carried out almost every day
to try both to flush out
Hamas fighters see the top
command which would hide in
tunnels dug under the band of
Gaza but also it is one of the big
dreams of the Israeli staff of
release hostages that would be in the
Gaza strip while waiting for
continuous operations also in the
north of the Gaza Strip which was
largely destroyed and we arise the
question indeed return or not
Uh Palestinians who lived before
war before October 7 in the
North of the Gaza Stéphane band is it
that you could come back to this
controversy in Israel after the
declarations of two ministers who have
called a massive displacement of the
Gazaoui population outside the strip of
Gaza yes absolutely it is an idea that
circulate in the circles very right
Here in Israel, including these two ministers
are the representatives of Etamal Bergvir and
Motri strain that openly did
part of their wish to see a good
part of the population of Gaza and well
emigrant leave the Gaza strip for
be reinstalled elsewhere then yesterday the
Israeli press reported
contact between Israel and the Congo which
would be ready to accept inappropriate
Palestinians what the government
Israeli denied but finally it is a
idea that has been in the air since the 7th
October part of the population
Israeli believes that this situation
is untenable that the massacres committed
by Hamas were supported by a
largely part of the population is
any case what polls shows and
that then it is necessary at all costs not
Only win this war perhaps perhaps
even reinstall Israeli settlers
In the Gaza Strip but also do
decrease the Palian population of
Gaza strip is an idea that circulates
But which for the moment of course does not have
at all was taken up by the government
As such thank you Stéphane Har for
your details and to mark their
support for
