BEFORE THE OCTOBER 7 TERROR
ATTACKS.
>> AS THE WAR WAGES ON, HOUTHIS
REBELS TAX  CONTINUE ON SHIPS
IN THE RED SEA EVEN AFTER U.S.
AIRSTRIKES.
MASSIVE OIL PRODUCER, RUSSIA,
IS BATTERING UKRAINE.
THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF OIL IS
TO LOWER NOW THAN BEFORE THE
OCTOBER 7th HAMAS ATTACK IN THE
FEBRUARY 2022 INVASION OF
UKRAINE.
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
AS IT TURNS OUT, THERE ARE
OTHER HUGE ECONOMIC FORCES
OVERSHADOWING THE GEOPOLITICAL
RISK IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
IT STARTS WITH THE WORLD THAT
CAN LARGEST ECONOMY, CHINA.
THE POST-COVID ECONOMIC
RECOVERY IS BATTERING.
MAC CHINA HAS BEEN THE DRIVER
OF DEMAND AND OIL GROWTH FOR
TWO DECADES.
THAT GROWTH IS NO LONGER
NECESSARILY THERE.
>> PRODUCERS IN THE U.S. ARE
FLOODING THE MARKET WITH
SUPPLIES.
THE U.S. PRODUCES MORE OIL THAN
ANY OTHER NATION EVER, 13.2
MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN
OCTOBER.
THINK ABOUT GAS PRICES, SO
PSYCHOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT FOR
CONSUMERS.
THE NATIONWIDE AVERAGE IS
AROUND THREE DOLLARS FOR ONLY
THE SECOND TIME SINCE 2021.
THAT COMES AS DEMAND FOR
GASOLINE IN THE U.S. IS EXPECTED
TO FALL IN THE NEXT YEAR WITH
PEOPLE BUYING MORE ELECTRIC AND
FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES AND
COMMUTING LESS BECAUSE OF
HYBRID WORK.
IT'S NOT THAT IN THE DUST --
INVESTORS ARE IGNORING GLOBAL
CONFLICT.
PRICES DID STRIKE AFTER BOTH
WARS STARTED, BUT MARKETS HAVE
PROVEN SURPRISINGLY ADAPTABLE.
>> THE ULTIMATE THING IS, WHERE
DO YOU REALLY START TO SEE THE
RISK?
THAT COMES THE CLOSE OF THE WAR
GET TO IRAN POINT
>> THE ED SEA IS THREATENED BY
HOUTHIS REBELS  AND IS A MAJOR
THOROUGHFARE FOR OIL TANKERS,
BUT THEY SEEM MILLIONS MORE
BARRELS OF OIL SHIPMENTS PER DAY
AND THAT'S WHAT WORRIES EXPERTS.
>> IF YOU CLOSE THE STRAITS,
THE OIL HAS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.
MAC FOR NOW, SECURITY FEARS ARE
OVERSHADOWED BY THE BIGGER
ECONOMIC FORCES IN CHINA AND
