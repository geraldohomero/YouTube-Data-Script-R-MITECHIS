israel intensified its bombing of gaza
on monday
the dozens of pre-dawn air strikes came
a day after more than 40 palestinians
were killed the deadliest day since
israel began its bombardment of the city
exactly a week ago
rescuers spent sunday digging through
the rubble hoping to find survivors the
bombings also damaged a power line
linking gaza's only power plant to the
city's south
the united nations says that fuel
shortages could cause hospitals and
other facilities relying on generators
to lose power
electricity water and telecommunications
are cuts i have no idea when these
essential services will be restored we
have to endure such difficulty
palestine has been suffering from such
destruction for 15 years but now the
situation is even worse israel's attacks
have aggravated the suffering of the
palestinian people this is literally a
human tragedy as israeli strikes
pummeled gaza hamas launched rockets
towards israel overnight
most of the projectiles were intercepted
by israel's iron dome defense system and
air raid sirens warned residents to hide
in shelters
in contrast palestinians in gaza have
nowhere to run
the overcrowded city of 2 million people
has no bomb shelters
so many have no choice but to huddle in
fear in their homes or run onto the
streets
the israeli government says hamas has
misjudged the strength of israel warning
that its army will continue to act with
unprecedented force
government's insistence in continuing
the destruction and killing of a large
number of civilians including women and
children and the elderly and the
destruction of infrastructure and towers
are all war crimes against the
palestinian people and crimes against
humanity
israeli prime minister benjamin
netanyahu says israel's attacks will
continue at full force
even as the u.n warns that the region is
heading towards an uncontainable
security and humanitarian crisis
