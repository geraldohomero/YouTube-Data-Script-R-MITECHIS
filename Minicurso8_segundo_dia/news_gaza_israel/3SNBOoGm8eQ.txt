Major cities in China are rapid house skirts
Hundreds of millions of people
The Chinese can be in danger
New research results have come out CNN
US media such as broadcasting and New York Times
About 50 Chinese scientists on the 18th
Jointly participated in the previous month
Two major cited Chinese women in the published paper
Almost half of the cities noticeably
I'm sinking
This study reported in 2015
In 2022, China City High School 3 minutes
The surface of the two major cities occupied
To measure change as a satellite radar
The satellite data
How many throughout China
Systematically whether the city is sinking
This is the first time I measured it.
29% of the Chinese population
Almost half of the year is 4mm per year
It's all sinking at high speed
The person who lives here
It reached 270 million people every year
In the party that sinks faster than 10mm
67 million people live
Researchers are prevalent in groundwater extraction
Among the main factors of urban ground skirt
I pointed out that it was one
If you spread the groundwater, the groundwater surface
Lower and sinking the ground on it
Because of the city itself
Increasing also makes the ground sink
Another cause is by region
The capital Beijing, of course, Tenjin Shanghai
Coastal cities such as Guangzhou
It was found to be dangerous.
The influence of the skirt is that the sea level increases.
Because it becomes more serious along the coast
It can be sorted more easily in storms and floods
The researchers have 100 years
About 1 minute of the coast inside the sediment and sea level
Due to the rise, it is lower than the sea level
There is a huge damage and resident life
I warned that it could be dangerous
Researchers are completely stopped in the house skirt
The key to minimizing damage, but
It is to limit groundwater extraction
