PUBLIC TRANSIT, ONE OF THE BIG
CONCERNS IS LOAN ACTORS.
THANK YOU. GETTING BACK TO
THE TRI-STATE AREA FROM ISRAEL
HAS NOT BEEN EASY BUT SEVERAL
THE WEEKEND AND THREE HAVE COME
IN TODAY. WE CAUGHT UP WITH
GRATEFUL PASSENGERS AS THEY
ARRIVED BACK IN THE U.S.
SAFELY.
Reporter: AFTER A LONG AND
EMOTIONAL JOURNEY THIS WOMAN
REUNITED WITH HER GRANDPARENTS
AT NEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT TODAY BUT LEFT MOST OF
HER OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS BEHIND
IN ISRAEL.
I HAVE SEVEN OTHER SIBLINGS
IN ISRAEL. I HAVE PEOPLE THAT I
KNOW, FRIENDS THAT I KNOW IN
THE ARMY. I KNOW THEY GOT
KILLED.
Reporter: BEFORE THE WAR
STARTED, SHE HAD SCHEDULED A
LONG TRIP TO STAY WITH HER
GRANDPARENTS IN THE CATSKILLS.
RIGHT NOW ABROAD, COUNTLESS ARE
DEALING WITH OVERWHELMING
WORRIES. SINCE FINDING A FLIGHT
OUT OF ISRAEL CONTINUES TO BE A
STRUGGLE WITH MAJOR U.S.
AIRLINES LIKE DELTA, AMERICAN
FLIGHTS TWO AND FROM ISRAEL FOR
THE NEAR FUTURE.
CIVILIANS ARE AFRAID TO WALK
IN THE STREET.
THE STORES ARE CLOSED WE DO
NOT HAVE WORKERS, THERE IS NO
ONE AVAILABLE.
Reporter: MOST PEOPLE ARE
RELIEVED THEY GOT ON A FLIGHT
OUT OF THE WAR-TORN COUNTRY BUT
IMMERSE.
IT IS GOOD TO BE HERE BUT
SAD TO KNOW WE ARE LEAVING VERY
IMPORTANT PEOPLE BEHIND.
RIGHT OUTSIDE OF TEL AVIV AND
CAME TO AMERICA TO VISIT HER
ELDERLY PARENTS.
I DO NOT WANT TO CANCEL
I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY
OPPORTUNITIES I WILL HAVE TO
SEE THEM.
Reporter: THIS IN WAY YOU
COLLEGE STUDENT JUST FLEW BACK
AFTER A QUICK TRIP TO SEE HIS
FAMILY IN ISRAEL. WHILE HE WAS
HOME --
I HAVE THREE FRIENDS I LOST
I HAVE BEEN TO THREE FUNERALS
ONE DAY AFTER THE OTHER. YOU
JUST CANNOT IMAGINE, YOU SEE
FAMILIES LOSING THEIR KIDS.
Reporter: A LOT OF
PASSENGERS WE HAVE BEEN
SPEAKING WITH SAME IT IS SUCH A
SAD FEELING DO NOT KNOW WHEN
THEY WILL RETURN BACK TO ISRAEL
OR WHEN THEY DO, WHAT IT WILL
LOOK LIKE OR, FEEL LIKE.
