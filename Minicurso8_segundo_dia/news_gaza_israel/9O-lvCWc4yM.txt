now it's been 16 days since the Israel
Hamas War started tensions are
escalating on the battlefield there are
fears of a multif front War for Israel
and threat of an Ong ground Invasion for
Gaza but now let's take you to the site
where it all started on the morning of
7th October residents in southern Israel
woke up to their worst nightmare Israel
it was under attack one of the very
first places to Bear the onslaught of
AAS was kibuts B not sparing women
children and elderly the militants they
went on a killing spree and they took
dozens of hostages back to
Gaza killing hundreds at will they left
the place in Ruins and here is a report
from our correspondent Vishal Pand from
in Israel take a look at
this more than 100 people were killed
and many kidnapped from this kibuts B
because this was the place where Hamas
infiltrated first and they were killing
everyone and I came to
report my mom she was kidnapped by Hamas
I have a movie that
uh someone sent me from a telegram group
Gaza now and she was kidnapped with her
husband and two Neighbors From kib
B and I
guess they're inas now in in
Gaza that's
it look at these bullet holes of the
cars and I want to say something it's
not a war it's not a battlefield you see
the babies the mother the fathers in
their bedrooms in the protection rooms
and how the terrorist kill them it's not
a war it's not a Butterfield
it's a massacre it's a terror act
activity Hamas killed those people who
were trying to escape through this car
it's
unbearable I have so many funerals to be
in and you know I I can't even be in in
all the funerals you can see everywhere
is
Graves
and everywhere is
everyone is
dead
monsters even small children were not
spared by the
