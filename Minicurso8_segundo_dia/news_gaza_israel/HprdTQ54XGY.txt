We are talking today about
eight hostage releases that were
under the captivity of never two in one
first earlier on the day of
Today one of them is mine gem surely
This name sounds like this
girl who never asked that
I would record a video
They registered in the captivity there
We are seeing the images where she
He said he was receiving care for
All this in the conditions of
of captivity by a group
terrorist there were no people doubting
The veracity of those sayings basically
because I was already forced to record that
Good video are the images of the
reunion with his family of members
I repeat one of the eight released in two
Tandas today what is fear
of the negotiators remember that here
Egypt's absolutely key role play
Because it is the receiving country there is only one
Habilitated crossing that is Gaza's crossing
With Egypt the Rafa's cross but
mainly Qatar what they are fearing
At this time the negotiators with
Regarding the extension of this pause in
Israel's operations in exchange for
Reehen release that never has
enough reeen to release that is to say
who never knows a science which
It is the whereabouts of the renes that some
of these people are today in the hands of
Other organizations Imagine
The tenor of the disaster and the tangle
Complex of which we are already
speaking and of course fear too
For the whereabouts of the living family this
Argentine family we counted on the day
yesterday that he never reported that they died
both the 10 -month -old and his
Brother Ariel, 5 years old and his mother Shiri
Today he never spread a video of Jarden his
Dad asking to return to Israel and power
say goodbye to their loved ones from their
Family of course that here what
It is always warned is first to
doubt the veracity of everything that
ever disseminate because it is clearly
carrying a psychological war
And secondly the authorities of
Israel have repeated again and again
We know the whereabouts of this family for
supposed the whole world is looking at what
What's up here but the concern of
The negotiators is that a good part of
Reenes are no longer in the hands of
never
