>> Heather: A CANADIAN
INTELLIGENCE AGENT WHO WAS
DECORATED FOR HER WORK WITH
BRITAIN'S MI5 BUT FACED
DISCRIMINATION HERE IS TELLING
HER STORY IN A NEW BOOK.
CTV'S DANIELE HAMAMDJIAN ON THE
SPY WHO WAS ALSO A TARGET OF
HARASSMENT.
>> Reporter: THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN THE WORLD OF ESPIONAGE
DIDN'T REFLECT MUCH OF THE
WORLD.
AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE
IN CANADA.
IT SLOWLY CHANGED AFTER 9/11 I
GO WHEN AGENTS LIKE HUDA
MUKBIL CAME ALONG.
>> WHAT MAKES A GOOD SPY IS
HAVING GOOD INTUITION.
>> Reporter: FOR THE COUNTRY'S
FIRST BLACK ARAB CANADIAN SPY IT
WAS MORE THAN GOOD INTUITION
THAT PROPELLED HER OUT OF THE
CANADIAN AGENCY IN OTTAWA AND
INTO ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS
SECURITY SERVICES ON THE PLANET.
>> MI5, YOU KNOW, LEGENDARY, FOR
AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER THERE'S
NO BETTER OPPORTUNITY.
>> Reporter: JULY 2005.
AFTER A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON THE
BRITISH CAPITAL, AUTHORITIES
WERE DESPERATE TO TRACK DOWN THE
PERPETRATORS.
A SOMALI BORN BRITISH CITIZEN IS
DETAINED IN ROME AFTER
AUTHORITIES TRACE HIM THROUGH
HIS CELL PHONE CALLS.
MI5 PUT OUT A CALL FOR AN AGENT
WITH SPECIFIC LANGUAGE SKILLS IN
AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE U.S.
AND CANADA.
ONLY ONE PERSON FIT THE PROFILE.
YOU ARE OF ETHIOPIAN YEMENI
ORIGIN.
YOU GREW UP IN EGYPT, SPEAK MANY
LANGUAGES.
FRENCH, ARABIC, AROMO, HARARE
AND SOMALI.
YOU WERE QUITE THE CATCH FOR
MI5.
MUKBIL DESCRIBES IN A NEW BOOK
HOW WITHIN HOURS SHE WAS FLOWN
TO LONDON.
HER WORK HERE ULTIMATELY HELPED
SECURE CONVICTIONS FOR WHICH SHE
WAS REWARDED.
A STARK CONTRAST TO THE
DISCRIMINATION SHE FACED AT CSIS
WHICH SHE SUED, THE CASE SETTLED
OUT OF COURT.
>> THERE WERE PEOPLE WITHIN CSIS
THAT FELT THAT AS A MUSLIM, I
DIDN'T BELONG.
THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT WORK OF AN
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AND BEING A
MUSLIM WERE ANTITHETICAL.
>> Reporter: MUKBIL HAS NOW
LEFT CSIS AND IS OUT OF THE
SHADOWS AND ON A VERY PUBLIC
MISSION.
>> I SAVED LIVES.
THERE'S NO GREATER EXAMPLE OF
WHY DIVERSITY IS REALLY
ESSENTIAL TO THIS KIND OF WORK.
