well i think canada should definitely
follow us footsteps in boycotting at
least diplomatic boycott of the beijing
olympic games
because for communist parties such a
dictatorship that has killed millions of
chinese people to be able to host such
an international event
it's almost like the governments outside
of china are giving them legitimacy for
what they have done to the chinese
people and during the olympic games last
time at least the human rights abuses
that was intensified in china uh was
somewhat reported outside but i think
the international community should also
be aware that an event like this the
communist party is going to try to grab
more control over the chinese people the
western governments will be sending a
joint statement to the chinese communist
party that they cannot brazenly
abuse their own citizen and
the people in xinjiang tibetan people
falun gong hong kongers all these people
um
and this is the kind of stance that will
get chinese government to take more
cautious approach in the future
when they are thinking about
actions like uh kidnapping the two
michaels um and aggressive actions to
get the foreign government to do what
they want in the future
this is a sort of gesture that they are
showing to their own people like chinese
people inside china that the chinese
government's strong they're not going to
step down they're not going to be weak
but this shown of strength is not real
strength is there weakness is there
insecurity crying out um facing the
united foreign front athletes want to go
to the beijing olympics because they
have worked so hard for it but they are
facing the moral dilemma whether they
want to go into china and silencing
themselves never post anything
controversial on social media so that
they can get a visa to enter china or
that they want to exercise their freedom
of speech and be a full free human being
outside by letting the communist party
to host an event like this we're almost
giving them the power to control whether
an athlete has
the freedom to speak their mind even
outside of china in order to get into
china for the olympic games
