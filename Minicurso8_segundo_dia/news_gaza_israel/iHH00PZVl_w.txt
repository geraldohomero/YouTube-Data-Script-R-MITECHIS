HE MET WITH QATAR AND EGYPTIAN
OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE
OF THE HOSTAGES.
HE HAD THIS TO SAY AFTERWARDS.
>> THERE IS STILL A LOT OF WORK
TO BE DONE.
WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE AN
AGREEMENT IS POSSIBLE AND IS
ESSENTIAL.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK
RELENTLESSLY TO ACHIEVE IT.
>> NBCNEWS FOREIGN
CORRESPONDENT THAT BRADLEY
JOINS US.
WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE
CEASE-FIRE COUNTERPROPOSAL FROM
HAMAS LEADERS?
IS THERE A REALISTIC OPTION TO
INTO THE WAR?
>> Reporter: I SPOKE WITH AN
ISRAELI OFFICIAL THIS MORNING
AND I WAS TOLD IT IS
UNREALISTIC.
THIS IS A NONSTARTER FOR THE
ISRAELIS AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT
BRINGS THEM BACK TO SQUARE ONE.
THESE ARE THE SAME PROPOSALS
THAT HAMAS HAS HAD BEFORE, IT
IS VERY CLOSE TO THE NONWORKING
AGREEMENT THAT THEY WERE TRYING
TO DO EARLIER WHICH WAS A FULL
AND FINAL DECISION OF ALL
ISRAELI HOSTILITIES IN THE GAZA
STRIP.
THE FULL RELEASE OF ISRAELI
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS FROM
ISRAELI JAILS.
IT HAS BEEN 135 DAYS. IT
INVOLVES RECONSTRUCTION OF THE
GAZA STRIP, A MASSIVE
WITHDRAWAL OF ISRAELI FORCES
FROM THE GAZA STRIP AND AS FAR
AS THE ISRAELIS ARE CONCERNED
THIS WILL NOT WORK AND I HAVE
HEARD THAT THEY MAY NOT EVEN
PRESENT THIS, THEY THINK IT IS
UNWORKABLE AND A NONSTARTER.
>> THIS COUNTERPROPOSAL WITH
ANTHONY BLINKEN --
>> WE DON'T KNOW.
WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HIS
VISIT.
THE INTENTION OF THE LINK AND
VISIT IS HE WAS HERE IN ORDER
TO GET OVER THE LINE.
THAT IS WHY HE WAS SEEN ALL
AROUND THE REGION.
THAT IS WHY HE WAS VISITING
PLACES AND COUNTRIES THAT WERE
INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATION.
HE WAS GOING TO QATAR AND OF
COURSE IN ISRAEL NOW.
THESE ARE PART OF THE
NEGOTIATIONS THAT WERE INKED
OUT TWO WEEKS AGO.
