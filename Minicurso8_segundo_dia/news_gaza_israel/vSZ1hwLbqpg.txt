United States President Joe
Biden expressed his approval to speech
of the leader of the Democrats in the Senate
Shu Schumer in which he asked for new
elections in Israel Biden said that
Schumer showed a serious concern
shared not only by him but
Many Americans Schumer the first
Jewish to hold the position of leader of the
majority of the Senate accused Thursday to
Netanyahu to be one of the biggest
obstacles to peace in the region and
He literally said he had lost the
Rumbo the ELUT party led by
Netanyahu responded to Schumer that Israel
It is not a banana republic but a
independent democracy and
Criticism proudly in the United States
against Israel have increased as
The number of dead civilians and l grows
famine in the Palestinian enclave as
The UN José Díaz Briceño says in
Washington how how is the relationship
between the United States and Israel after
that biden will support the words of
Schumer although President Biden
He said it had been a good speech
The White House was very careful to
say that the administration biden in itself
same does not support the call to new
elections in Israel as the
Schumer leader in his speech
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken without
embargo recognized that relationships
Between Israel and the United States huh continue
ahead beyond color or
party sign that governs any
What is true is that there is a
serious frustration inside the
Biden administration and inside the
Democratic party for the course that has
Taken the current the current war in
Rafa forgive in Gaza and precisely the
President Biden last weekend
had placed a potential invasion of
that city of Rafa as a red line and
However, at this time it should not
Wait for the United States to limit
Eh, for example, weaponing to
called eh iron dome that protects
Israel of rocket attacks and without
embargo the democrats themselves in the
Chamber and in the Senate are pushing
legislation to limit precisely to
condition the military aid of
launch of bombs that have launched
just Israel in the territory of
Gaza that could be the next moment
of tension here thank you very much
