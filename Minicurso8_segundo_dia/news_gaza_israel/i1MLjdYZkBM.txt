>> LOOK, AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, 
THE DEFEATED CONFEDERATES 
COULDN'T ACCEPT THE VERDICT OF 
THE WAR. THEY HAD LOST. 
SO THEY SAY -- THEY EMBRACE 
WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE LOST

BE CLEAR TO THOSE WHO DON'T

THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION ABOUT 
THAT.

ERA OF A SECOND LOST CAUSE. 
ONCE AGAIN, THERE ARE SOME IN 
THIS COUNTRY TRYING TO TURN

ALLOWED TO LIVE WILL ONCE AGAIN 
BRING TERRIBLE DAMAGE TO THIS 
COUNTRY. 
THIS TIME THE LIE IS ABOUT THE 
2020 ELECTION, THE ELECTION IN

THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF ONE OF THE 
DARKEST DAYS IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY, JANUARY 6th, A DAY IN 
WHICH INSURRECTIONIST STORMED 
THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL
