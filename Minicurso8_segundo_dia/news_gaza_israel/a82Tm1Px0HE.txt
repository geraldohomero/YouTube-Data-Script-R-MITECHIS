this has become a common site at the
handful of fuel stations in Gaza that
have reopened long lines and crowds of
people desperate to fill their
containers with a precious liquid some
even Camp here
overnight I've been coming here for 3
days trying to get some fuel there are
too many people here because only a few
stations are
operating people need fuel to get clean
water for their vehicles bakeries for
many reasons for nearly 2 month under
Israel's total Siege of the territory no
fuel or gas supplies have been allowed
into Gaza under the ceasefire agreement
two to four trucks of fuel have been
entering to the southern Gaza every day
about 140,000 L of fuel that's nowhere
near enough the United Nations estimates
that about 250,000 L of fuel are needed
every day for humanitarian purposes such
as operating generators and the
salination plants while
800,000 to a million lers of fuel are
going to be needed daily if these cars
are going to be operating
again the shortage has forced
Palestinians to find Alternatives one of
them is cooking oil nicknamed Falafel
fuel after the chick piece s it's what
most drivers in southern Gaza are using
to power their
vehicles a small quantity of petrol is
diluted with vegetable
oil I need my car to work and feed my
family I know it's bad for my health
mine especially because I'm a cancer
patient but what other choice do I
have with fewer buses and taxis on the
roads donkey carts have made a comeback
they provide a source of income to those
who've lost their farms and
businesses with this war we're living
tragic times so our carts are becoming a
mode of transportation there's no fuel
in Gaza and no cars are operating people
need to get around sometimes to places
that are far away and Donkey cuts are
the only
way the problems are numerous but
Palestinians here say they've endured so
much already that they're determined to
overcome these latest challenges y Al
