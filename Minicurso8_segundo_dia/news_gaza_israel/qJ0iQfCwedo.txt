details of another highly disturbing
hostage situation have surfaced
from a princess missing for years
latifa is the daughter of dubai's ruler
in a series of secretly recorded
messages she pleads for help tonight
the u.n is promising action ctv's paul
workman has that story
three years after vanishing behind the
walls of a heavily guarded villa
princess latifah al maktoum has made a
disturbing reappearance
i'm a hostage and this villa has been
converted into a jail all the windows
are borrowed shut i can't open any
window
there's five policemen outside and two
policewomen inside the house
bitterly unhappy daughter colossally
rich father
who was no stranger to the queen of
england's royal circle
in 2018 for the second time latifah
tried to flee her father's fierce
control
and start a new life he ruthlessly
tracked her down
using a team of indian commandos and
forcibly brought her home
we went up and they had all had their
guns pointed
at us and i didn't know what to expect
really
and i kept saying you know like
you can't take me back her best friend
tina was with her
and helped plan the escape the commandos
were basically
threatening to shoot me i was told to
take my last breath
even um so that was definitely a moment
for me
when i saw my life flashing before my
eyes
latifa's friends managed to smuggle in a
phone but haven't heard from her now in
many months
her father sheikh mohammed al-maktoum
has remained largely silent
insisting his daughter is safe and happy
we asked latifah to to send us as much
evidence as possible
because we were thinking that maybe one
day
we might be needing it now that we've
lost lost contact and
we feared that you know the the phone
was discovered
and you know we don't know what the
consequences are going to be mary
robinson a former u.n human rights
commissioner met latifah in 2018
and described her as lovingly cared for
she says now she was horribly tricked
latifah supporters say they released the
videos largely out of desperation
hoping that pressure from world leaders
from the u.n
will lead to her freedom paul workman
