Criticism of the State of Israel and the People of Israel in 202

Be one We know that Hamas is still
Holding hostages and we know that a Ceas
Must be agreed between the Parties but
We can
Also
The ISRA can observe international
Humanitarian law I have seen a
Harrowing number of Civilians included
Children killed this has to end and we
are particularly concerned with what is
Happening with medical
