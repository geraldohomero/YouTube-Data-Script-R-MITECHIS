Saturday morning my sister she's us a
In house and send a voice message
Chilling voice message saying we Can
Hear them in the house they are burning
The house smoke is getting under the
Door we don't think We're gonna make it we
Love you her last message was help to us
Dying my sisters Daniel Sharon and their
Daughter Julie emma emilia
I..
Elijah, my firstborn son, we are one soul
We really are a soul
One of his girlfriend Ziv She told me they were at the party
There were straps. They wanted to ride and started driving
They threw grenades at them
Apg Ziv fell All the bodies fell and so on
She was saved and didn't move to her injured. They looked at one
On the other and held hands
He's strong He told her he was injured, but that he was fine
And then suddenly she felt
Somebody pull it off just pull it out of a pile
The bodies came up Him on the truck
And Nassau, I ask you to give me back my son
Mine we get a call from her partner oak
That number He ran as fast as he could in a moment's.
A quick look back at him, he sees Jordan hiding
Under the tree with your hands Over the head to protect
This is the last time anyone has seen Jordan
Or know something about Jordan civilian
Germany And I really expect the whole world to understand
That it's not just Israel's problem. It's the home of
Germany and Europe and all of them
The world is citizens of innocent old women and children
That just are now
In captivity
My sister over there can
I am calling on the Israeli government and the government
Germany and the world
All of it. Give me back
My sister Ronen is kind of a phenomenon
An incredibly optimistic so-called non-always A warrant
Jokes don't make him nervous
Unnelly would drive my parents kind of crazy
Suddenly he settled down
Three women
Kids and him and his wife and his two daughters are gone
Over my face
The ground and then on strike 12 I suddenly enter
Facebook's. Ronon and I see in his story
Some despicable terrorist smiles at the camera and says no.
You know, in Arabic, I'm just falling apart
Same
If I can hold on to something, he'll know
Find the power to somehow get through this
Please bring it back My brother Ronen is his wife
Carina radiates his daughter Mika and his daughter Yuval
Please bring them back
