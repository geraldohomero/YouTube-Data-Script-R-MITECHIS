joins us from israel's arab-populated
city um
he's one of the lawyers for the people
threatened with eviction welcome to trt
world is this now the end of it can
those people remain in their homes
no because the israeli government
has finished its meeting before a few
minutes and i get
a message telling that the israeli
government decided to evict
the
village
but they will allow delay of some weeks
in order to
get an agreement with the residents of
khan lahmar in order to evict them to
another place
and what of the demolition is there any
idea from that meeting and your source
in that meeting as to whether the
demolition goes ahead or not
we don't know
because also we know that
the israeli prime minister is a
zigzagging person and we don't know uh
yesterday he declared that he will delay
the demolition in order to
get an agreement with the residents of
khan lahmat but today we
hear that he will withdraw from this
declaration
so we will we don't know maybe tomorrow
he will decide to demolish
the village so we don't know
really we expected that maybe the
uh we submitted the outline plan before
uh three months in order to legalize the
houses of the village
and we expect that
this solution that we
suggested to the israeli government
maybe maybe will be the solution for
this
village
what what is your sense of why the
israeli government has prevaricated and
changed tax so much on this
first of all
the reason
why they want to evict this place
because
this is the palestinian-israeli struggle
and they don't want the palestinians to
be in this strategic place
they they want to clean it from
palestinians in order to expand the
israeli settlements in this place in
this specific place
which they
dream that israel is a dream that it
will be a the great jerusalem
now after the international community
pressure
and in these
the last two months
i think
it did its results and the the
declaration of the israeli prime
minister yesterday was the result of
this of this international community
pressure
traffic jabarine thank you very much for
talking to us
