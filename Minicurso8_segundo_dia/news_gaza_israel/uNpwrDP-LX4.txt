The budget that only used to defend this air raid
All of our 4 billion won
In terms of money, 1.47 trillion won
About 1.84 trillion won in won
Need
I said. Israeli as of last year
The annual budget is 22.3 trillion
It's a circle, but considering Yiyi, only overnight
The cost of 6.3% of military budgets
It's a short distance missile
Operating irondo used in interceptors
50,000
David's stoneware, which is a substitute for medium -range launch
$ 1 million
To intercept a ballistic missile
2 million dollars for 2 prices 3 is 62 million
It is estimated in dollars
In other words, we will add up spending by element.
It is only about 1.800 million won.
Israeli's fiscal torture
This is an opinion.
Two combat flight battalion destroyers
Mobilization of air defense networks, etc.
Shooting the early tile missile centuries, respectively
There's a bar. British France is also in this defense
It was known that it helped
Without help, the defense cost would have been greater.
On the other hand, in the case of Iran, drones
300 and some ballistic missiles
Mobilized
I informed you that the drone Ki -jeong mobilized
It was identified as Shin 13, but one party
The upright is $ 20,000 for $ 20,000
I know it's a level, but also ballistic
More than 120 missiles are mobilized
It is known, but as the model is not identified
Exact Chusa is difficult
There is a gelja 3 as a model
The price is $ 1.5 million in our money 2 billion won
It is estimated to be enough overnight
Israel first
It is true that you succeeded in defending, but only the cost
When you look at it, the air raids and retaliation in the future
If it is repeated, the annual military budget is quickly
To be exhausted
It seems to be costly.
The enormousness that must be Israel in the war
In addition, the cost of the Iranian response
It seems to be another variable
