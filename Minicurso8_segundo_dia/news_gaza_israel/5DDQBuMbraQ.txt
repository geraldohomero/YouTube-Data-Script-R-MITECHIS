There is no fact today there
has no ability to show that there is
a traceability of armament or
know-how of Russia on this
Operation of Hamas uh we have a lot
questions on the side of Iran
question of Russia is not
came directly to the euh table
It's true that we are with a president
Zelenski who finds himself in a
delicate situation since today
media eyes are on the
Near and Middle East and as I
Recall it Ukraine needs
a lot of armaments every day
and indeed when he had 300,000
ammunition that came from the stock
American and who was in the
territory
Israeli all that makes aid that
will be less from this
moment so it's true that we have
today a media campaign and
When he spoke in this
interesting interview for
Caroline Rou he has indeed poeted
Russian know-how finger saying
that there was a whole arc that was putting
in place but it's part
actually things that remain
extremely complicated which is certain
It is that we will find a little armament
everywhere because Western armaments
which is delivered to the Ukrainians too you
know that there are also a lot of
today's requests for
know where does it become and
knowing that suddenly by circuits of
corruption we can find it everything
is elsewhere that is one of the big ones
worries about where in these
wars we meet but we have
today a strong Ukrainian president
worried because if we have a war
So we are still there in the side a
little atrocious e of a comment because
that we are not in the war saying but if
You have a war that struck the
Israelis with 1000 dead which for 6
million is huge you have a
Ukrainian president who is a country that
between 30 to 40 million and which counts
figure is unknown because they do not
don't want to give but we know there
At several thousand deaths all
days on the Donbas side and that we are at
Over 100,000 Ukrainian deaths
certainly
