leave abbas not often heard chance aimed
specifically at the palestinian
president
several thousand came out to bury nizar
banat here in hebron
one of the palestinian authorities most
prominent critics
we are too angry the the all responsible
from this crime is the president abbas
in ramallah and his authority and his
prime
minister
[Music]
in order to silence his opposition to
the palestinian authority
bernat was fiercely outspoken against
the pa and its senior leadership
accusing them of corruption human rights
violations and being a so-called
subcontractor for israel
he had recently called on the european
union the pa's largest supplier of
foreign cash
to stop sending funds after president
mahmoud abbas again
cancelled long-awaited elections i'm
very disappointed that the international
community
is not putting any pressure on the pa to
stop its
corruption and its its oppression
against its own people
banat died after around 25 members of
the palestinian authority security
forces
came to detain him in the middle of the
night and severely beat him according to
his family
human rights groups who carried out a
preliminary autopsy
said his body showed signs of bruising
on the neck head
chest back and legs and some ribs were
also broken
the palestine liberation organization
has issued a statement
saying there will be a transparent and
impartial investigation
a recent poll shows that the palestinian
authority is facing a great deal of
criticism from its people
everyone here has told us they're fed up
many tell us they want the death of
nizar banat to become a turning point
but they also say it will be very
difficult and dangerous
to achieve real change by taking to the
streets in large numbers
