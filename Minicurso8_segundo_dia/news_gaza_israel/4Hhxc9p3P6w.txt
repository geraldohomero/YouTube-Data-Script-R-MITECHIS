intermittent bombardment of
the Israeli army and this

Several media uh an Israeli armored

operations in retaliation of attacks
Israeli in recent days

Tented in Southliban where the army
Israeli asked the inhabitants of
regions located less than 4 kilometers from the
blue line to stay at home uh
local sources have indicated that the army
Israeli had launched in the middle of
White phosphorus bombs day
On several border localities
in particular that of Hachab where at least one
civil would have been injured in the clouds

Border town of the Recende which was
targeted by Israeli shells uh we
Recalls for several days these
shooting exchanges on both sides of the
blue line would be part of the
of a tacit exchange in commitment
tacit that provides strikes
equivalent and this is the case so since
over a week punctuated by
sometimes very violent tension and
bloody three Lebanese civilians were
killed in recent days and several
Others were injured thank you very much
