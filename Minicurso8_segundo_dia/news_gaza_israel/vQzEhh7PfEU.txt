thoughts and let's be clear I mean I was
one of the first Le to call uh prime
minister and president of Israel after
the terrorist attack the 7th of October
we clearly condemn this terrorist attack
and terrorist group and recognize the
right of Israel to protect itself and
react but day one we say that this
reaction and the fight against
terrorism because it is led by a
democracy should be compliant with
International rules all of war and and
humanitarian international
law and and day after day what we saw is
a permanent bombing of civilians in
Gaza meanwhile Spain's prime minister

on the 7th of October and called for the
release of Israeli hostages however
