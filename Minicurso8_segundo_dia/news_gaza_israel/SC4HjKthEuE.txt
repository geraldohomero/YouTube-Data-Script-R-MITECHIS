And Karim Yayaoui is with us Karim we
feels that the Israeli army is soon
ready to launch the assault we have
an idea of how she counts
Take exactly then Laassau will have
undoubtedly a protean form
That is to say, there will be several
types of fighters that go
get involved in this in this
battle obviously we will continue to
Bombing is what is already done
For several days to prepare
This terrestrial offensive there will be
men on the ground who will enter
The g band we saw that strength
specials had already crossed the wall of
separation to recover from
body probably hostages that we do not
not know when they perished and
Then there will be an offensive
probably by the sea, that is to say
that we are going to take in Neto in some
sort the band of Gaza all this in a
almost total black since there is
almost more electricity more
of petrol to power the
generators and therefore if this operation has
night place it will be an element
perhaps additional in favor of
Israeli army fighters
which has a device to aim
night extremely sophisticated in
Any case we can feel that there is a
Willingness to take the fighters in eo
Hamas who have probably prepared
also this moment since since and since
even before he launched their operation
bloody against Israel there is a
week he knew that there
A would have a response and that perhaps
that Israeli soldiers would be
brought to the Gaza Strip
Uh these special forces that have
penetrated on the side of the Gaza strip have
recovered bodies but they are without
doubt also went to seek
information to know which
possible device had already been put
in place uh but we know very well that
It's very difficult for the army
Israeli to have all the data
Uh with regard to regarding
concerns Hamas we saw that they had
failed uh compared to what was
spent last week since they
have not necessarily seen this coming this
large -scale offensive from
Hamas under conditions
particularly terrible for for
Israelis and therefore they have
Maybe not all the elements and it is
probably why there was a
Extremely heavy wave of bombing
to try to destroy the
Hamas infrastructure and at the same time
time to eliminate like these two members
important Hamas that seem to have
summer elim
a maximum of thinking head of
the terrorist organization
