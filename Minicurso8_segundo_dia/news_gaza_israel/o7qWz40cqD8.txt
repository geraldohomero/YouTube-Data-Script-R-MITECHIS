DÃ­ 61 of the war in Israel will happen
as the most intense in terms of
fighting since the war began
From the terrorist attacks of the 7 of
October this is what the
own spokesmen of the force of
Israel's defense and fighting have
South transferred in the vicinity
from the town of Shan Yunis that is the
most important urban center in the south
Second most important in the entire strip
from gaza and what you are seeing
here type of fighting that are
registering right now there are
Melee combat where behind
a corner appears terrorists in
This case are chija terrorists
Islamic that they themselves disseminate
your official accounts this video of how
They ambush Israeli soldiers
I insist appearing from the corners
shooting launches from the
Windows is this scenario
urban in which it is developing
The fight will see here how they shoot
With good mortars is a scenario of
very high complexity because all all
The area is overcrowd because the
population that was in the north was
evacuated by Israel to the south for that
It has huge difficulties too
Israel continues with air attacks
selective that is a bit what you saw
just and is moving forward in this way
in a war that is now entering
A critical land the question that now
is done in Israel and how we do in this
context where we cannot operate with
freedom to for example affect the
tunnel system that ever has where
They hide good and if you pump water from
sea and flood all these tunnels
Of course what happens is that there may be
Hostage some of the 137 that continue
There this is generating protests for
part of the reeens towards the government
Israeli a situation that goes
back more and more criticism at 61 days
of this war began the day more
intense fighting
