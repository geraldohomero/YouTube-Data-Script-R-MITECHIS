Yesterday's tough on the issue is an inevitable event either
It requires rethinking the way it works
of the forces
I don't know the area All the circumstances that he was careful about
I do not know this principle, which I regret
In wars, there are events that are unusual
I have a very heavy price on the last one
I will tell you that in Gaza the reality is
Different from the fight effort her name is very massive There isn't.
There has never been an Israeli war of this magnitude
of such force-size forces of such a powerful bomb
Fire On such a small area in the face of such terror
Determined to destroy it, Jaya is known as well
We have a little warrant for the truth Neighborhood
It’s really hard to fight, and then I did
I heard it from my son who actually said he was
We'll go in That's when I realized it wasn't there
It's just not just that it's getting in. It's how you say it
Or life either
Death And as it is, here we really have lost the most
It’s the worst pain that I have, as if there is no me
Says it's that thing It's not over that this operation was planted
That started
The war was parenting to be set on fire and the army was
Much more aggressive now going deep
The area to collect lions into the snake pit of Cesaria
This isn't about this
Soldiers on our sons don't have any 'Cause they are
Die to keep the Nazis alive
The Nazis in the Gaza Strip are worth nothing compared to one blood
One fingernail's. A Golani soldier, I think, is a country
Israel has to pay very heavy prices
The fact that he visited these people that Saturday
But We must admit that the leader who stood in front of us did not
Feeling pressure no conditions he does not feel the sword
On the neck until the conditions are not met The Goddess
Still after 70 days of fighting so aggressively
And the massive leader in front of us doesn't feel the sword
On the Chain No doubt I will tell you more than that
In my eyes this morning, Sinwar feels euphoric yesterday
He's with his men in Sega caused a lesion Commanders
And the soldiers of the army he fought in Sega in Jabaliya Lo
Two brigades in the camps in Rafah that we have not yet begun
Face them there A tough fight he will take
Weeks
