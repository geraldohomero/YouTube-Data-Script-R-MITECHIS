This summit La France which announced this
morning that she was going to bring to 100
million euros for the current year on
amount of his humanitarian aid for
Palestinian civilian population is
five times more than today
huh it's five times more and on the side
a number of organizations
notably
The Unra this agency for refugees
Palestinians who was represented by
Philippe Lazarini is a one one
very important movement because we have
need a lot of money in this
moment for the inhabitants of the band of
Gaza but also for those who are trying
to use on site to help the
Civil population Philippe Lazarini has
underlined that the Unra was in difficulty
even to pay his employees his

billions by the end of the year to
relieve the Gaza strip and the
Sixjordanie uh the Gaza Strip where we have
Need all water food
drugs but also fuel for

generators that feed
electricity uh
residents of de Gaza a situation
humanitarian therefore catastrophic as
underlined the President President of the
Republic with this urgency to act on
Emmanuel Macron faster
led to this
humanitarian dimension but it also has
mentioned the security dimension and
political dimension that seems for their
distant but the president of the
Republic also tried to revive this
hope this hope of seeing two day two
Cohabiting states we are still far away
today but on the side of the Élysée we
tends to project uh towards a solution
Politics The President of the Republic
also underlined the need should
set up the conditions of in
stop the fire uh which was also
called uh called by a number
representatives of the UN and NGOs
today which precisely evokes this
need to set up a cessation
The fire very quickly the problem is
that on the Israeli side this hypothesis side
still seems extremely distant
