Israel dropped 6000 Bamas on Gaza
3600 bases broke the price and go to Hades
How to hide Hamas Israel
Destruction Israel's fighter plane
The entire city targeted hundreds of locations
Seven days turned into a pile of debris
More than 6000 bombs inside Gaza
Turned into a grave took from height
If you look at the pictures, then everyone will be seen
Side
Israeli claims of ruin on every side
Is that a large number of Hamas terrorists in these
Hums have been piled up in attacks
It has gone but the question arises that if Hamas
Who is staining the rocket if the waist is broken
Which is the network of Hamas which is so
This is active today despite heavy destruction
In the video, we will give you this strength of Hamas
Will actually tell about 10 kilometers wide
And 41 km tall Gaza area on three sides
The land is connected to the sea and all three are connected to the sea
The ground areas open from Israel i.e.
Gaza is surrounded by every side, so terrorists
A full to avoid Israel's attack
Proof is found out

This tunnel has been prepared by an amazing network
The second world reminds London
People of London during the war of Germany
Similar tunnel to avoid air attack
Hamas, a terrorist organization, used to take stage
Such a tunge which was made under the city of Gaza
Are and Khan goes to Younis and Rafa
Humas ammunition in the tunnel
Not only this, the safe of the terrorists
House is also light in these tunnels
Electric supply is also there for food and drink
All the stuff remains out of the tunnel
There are hundreds of ways many tunnels are raw
While most tunnels are made from brick
That means strong and no air attack
There is no effect, let us tell you that claim
It is being done that this tunnel of Hamas Iran
It is made with the help of scientific basis
There is scope for wind and light in it
Israel always remains
To eliminate terrorists hidden in tunnels
For the grassroots fight, he has made up his mind
Number of tanks and cannons near Gaz
It is believed to be deployed
Israeli army in search of one end of tunnel
So that the entire tunnel is also destroyed by catching it
Being done
