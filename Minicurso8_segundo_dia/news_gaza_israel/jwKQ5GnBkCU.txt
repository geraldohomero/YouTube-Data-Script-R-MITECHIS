commented on all sides of obviously
Washington we saw it a little earlier at
Brussels also from the headquarters of
Lutan where Volodimir arrived this morning
ZÃ©inki the Ukrainian president press
Western to show the Israelis
that they are not alone last night
kyiv's strong man said he was certain
that Moscow supports the operations of
Hamas in Israel This support is proven
I suggest listening to the
Armel's response
Charer There is no fact today
There is no ability to show
that there is armament traceability or
of Russia's know-how on this
Operation of Hamas we have a lot
questions on the side of Iran
question of Russia is not
coming directly on the table it is
true that we are with a president
Zelenski who finds himself in a
delicate situation since today
media eyes are on the
Near and Middle East and as I
Recalls Ukraine needs
a lot of armaments every day
and indeed when he had 300,000
ammunition that came from the stock
American and who were in the
territory
Israeli all that makes aid that
will be less from this
moment so it's true that we have
today a media campaign and
When he spoke in this
interesting interview for
Caroline Rou he actually pointed out
of the Russian know-how by saying
that there was a whole arc that was putting
in place but it's part
actually things that remain
extremely complicated which is certain
It is that we will find a little armament
everywhere because Western armaments
which is delivered to the Ukrainians too you
know that there are also a lot of
today's requests for
know where does it become and
knowing that suddenly by circuits of
corruption we can find it everything
is elsewhere that is one of the big ones
worries about where in these
wars we meet but we have
today a strong Ukrainian president
worried because if we have a war
So we are still there in the side a
little atrocious eh of a comment
because we are not in the experience of
direct wars but if you have a
war that struck the Israelis with
1000 dead which for 6 million is
huge you have a Ukrainian president
which is a country that between 30 to 40
million and which counts the figure is
unknown because they don't want
give but we know that there are several
thousands of deaths every day on the side
Dombas and that we are over 100,000
Ukrainian dead
certainly
