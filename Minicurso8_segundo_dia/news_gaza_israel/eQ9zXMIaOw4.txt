E
PRETTY UGLY STUFF WITH PUT IT
THAT WAY.
>> NOW THIS AN INTERNAL MEMO AT
THE STATE DEPARTMENT BLAST
BIDENS HANDLING OF ISRAEL IT
ACCUSES HIM OF BEING COMPLICIT
IN GENOCIDE AND COMMITTING WAR
CRIMES, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR
MIKE HUCKABEE WITH ME, THIS IS
ONE EXAMPLE OF A REBELLION BY
CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS BY BIDEN
IN ISRAEL POLICY.
AS YOU LOSING CONTROL OF HIS OWN
GOVERNMENT.
>> I'M NOT SURE HE WAS IN
CONTROL OF HIS OWN GOVERNMENT.
I'M PRETTY SURE THERE WERE OTHER
PEOPLE PULLING THE STRINGS AND
HE'S THE GUY THAT COULD WELL BE
CAST A WEEK AND A BERNICE 2.0
BUT HERE'S THE REAL REALITY.
WITHIN THE STATE DEPARTMENT
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A DISSENT
CHANNEL WHERE PEOPLE WERE
DIPLOMATS CAN EXPRESS THEMSELVES
AND SUPPOSED TO BE QUIET WITHIN
THE BUILDING AND NOT LEAKED OUT.
OBVIOUSLY IT DID GET LEAKED OUT.
AND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE
IS HEAVY HEARTBURN WITHIN THE
STATE DEPARTMENT WITHOUT THE
SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL HERE'S WHAT
THAT DOES FOR ME I GET HEAVY
HEARTBURN REALIZING HOW MANY
PEOPLE WORK FOR THE U.S. STATE
DEPARTMENT WHO ARE PRO-HAMAS AND
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE JEWS ON
OCTOBER THE SEVENTH WAS ANYTHING
LESS THAN A MASSACRE AT THE
LEVEL OF THE HOLOCAUST, THIS IS
HORRIBLE, NOBODY CAN DEFEND
THAT, THAT I DID ISRAEL'S
COMMITTING GENOCIDE IS AN
ABSENCE OF ANY FACT THAT ISRAEL
HAS TAKEN EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO
PROTECT THE CITIZENS AND THE
CIVILIANS ABOUT HAMAS KEEPS
PUTTING THEM RIGHT IN FRONT OF
THE INTENDED TARGET, LET'S BLAME
HAMAS AND QUIT BLAMING ISRAEL
FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON.
STUART: IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO
SEE A VICE PRESIDENT, BUT HERE
IS WHERE THE VICE PRESIDENT
HIMSELF SHOWS UP AT THE PRO
ISRAEL RALLY TODAY IN D.C., THAT
WOULD BE SAYING SOMETHING, THAT
WOULD BE GOING DIRECTLY AGAINST
MANY OF HIS STAFFERS.
>> IT WOULD BE SAYING SOMETHING.
I HOPE THEY DO IT WOULD BE TO
HIS CREDIT AND REALLY OUTSPOKEN
FOR HIS SUPPORT TO ISRAEL, IN
THE LAST WEEK OR SO THEY GOT A
LITTLE SOFTER AND THEY'RE
PUSHING THESE IDEAS OF PAUSES IN
CEASE-FIRE NOT EXCESSIVELY, IF
YOU WANT TO END THIS, HAMAS LET
ALL THE HOSTAGES GO, SURRENDER
AND THEN WE HAVE PEACE, UNTIL
THAT HAPPENS, AS LONG AS YOU ARE
STORING WEAPONS AND CONTINUING
TO THREAT JEWS IN THE MOST
DISGUSTING ATROCIOUS WAY, THERE
IS NO NEGOTIATION, THE
NEGOTIATION IS WORKING TO COME
GET YOU AND BRITTA TAKE YOU OUT
