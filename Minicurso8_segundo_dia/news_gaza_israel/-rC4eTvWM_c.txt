We know that to prevent a return
violence must be used space
Created by this ceasefire to answer
to other underlying problems and
To start you have to tackle the
Difficult humanitarian situation in Gaza
and start rebuilding
United States will work to bring together
international support around this
effort in addition to our own
contribution that we will announce more
late you also need to work with
our partners to ensure that the
Hamas does not benefit from helping
reconstruction
If ramage rapes the truce and attack
Israel our answer will be very strong
We also discussed the
way of improving life and
Humanitarian conditions of Palestinians
in Gaza
President Biden totally reason
when he says there will be no
peace as long as Israel is not recognized
as an independent Jewish State and the
ceasefire has been going on for four days
now it is done in steps like
explain it to us our special envoy
In the Bono Gaza Wendling Strip
must have in mind that it is
a cease ceasefire by phases it is
for the moment of the first phase which
is the fighting and it holds
This is what a framework of the
Hamas in the Gaza Strip for
the moment the two parts none of the
Two parties have interest to go anymore
far the word for the moment is very
important in the sentence since the
Islamist group always has a finger on
the trigger what to observe
now this is the second phase of this
Stop fire which consists of an agreement
wider so we observe here in Gaza
encouraging signs for example
Kerem Shalom 1 terminal that leaves
Passing humanitarian aid reopened by
elsewhere the Gaza fishermen can
new go fishing in an area of
fishing which covers six nautical miles that
These are encouraging signs
There are also negotiations on
reconstruction which are on the table and
According to several sources here an exchange
prisoners is also one of the
negotiations must be remembered that
Israelis want to recover the
body of two soldiers who are between
Hands of Hamas in the Gaza Strip
So that's it for the negotiation part
This is what it means to consolidate this
Stop fire that is the task when
Tony Blinken
the secretary of state a difficult task
Because all this is extremely fragile
An incident in Jerusalem for example
could mean the return to
armed confrontation
