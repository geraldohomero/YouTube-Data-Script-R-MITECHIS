I refer to the walker on the one hand
Israel's security and after 23
Hours of discussions has just issued a
statement in which it is stated that
after all levels of
security would decide to support accept the
proposal the Egyptian initiative to
getting to a stop the fire is that everyone
Unanimity ministers too
They decided to move forward and approve
such an initiative together with this despite
that the different media

They assure that it will be within less than
three hours or two of the

Bombing alerts continue in the
Interior of Israel is not an amount
big but that the
projectile releases against
Israel and in fact still the cessation of the
violence will come into force within

The dawn local time but next to

opportunity an opportunity that can
be important that arises above all
After the US president
