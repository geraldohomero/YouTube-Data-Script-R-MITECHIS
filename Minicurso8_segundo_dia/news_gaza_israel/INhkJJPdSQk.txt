Kidnapped our citizens we're continuing the war up
The end to victory
The absolute until we achieve our entire goal of eliminating the violence
You have all returned Abducted and a promise that Gaza will never be
Another threat to Israel, we will restore security
To the south as well
Nobody north Won't stop us. No hag no axis
Evil and no one

The Philadelphia Plan is one option Shel
What I call a south brace or a southern blockage
You know we're not gonna end the war without it
We close the breach That is because we will destroy it
The violence
We will actually take care of the Gaza Strip and then every time
I'll go in. I'll go in. Another means More fighting
Deadly means through that southern breach then
It has to be closed, there are a few options
How to close it we are Check them out, but help
We've made a decision except for one thing it has to be
