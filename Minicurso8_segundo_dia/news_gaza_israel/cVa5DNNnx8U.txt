more than 200 palestinians and 10
israelis have been killed
in that time and despite growing
international calls for a ceasefire
there's no sign the violence is abating
in fact
it's spreading intercommunal violence
has been breaking out in israel in the
past couple of days
and in the west bank at least 10
palestinians have been killed there in
clashes with israeli forces
so let's talk about that with our
special correspondent in jerusalem
gallagher fenwick gallagher
when we spoke earlier we talked about
what's been happening where you are in
jerusalem what's been happening in gaza
tell us though what we understand has
been happening today and in the past few
days as well in the west bank
and which you could describe as a third
front that
israeli is currently confronted to
namely in the west bank
impressive images of ongoing clashes
notably coming out of the city of albire
which is some 15 kilometers north of
jerusalem
close to ramallah that's a a city that
has
often been a flashpoint because of its
close proximity to
israeli-jewish settlements and that is
where we have seen clashes
in recent days and again today between
jewish settlers
israeli soldiers and palestinians
palestinians are hurling stones in the
direction
of their enemies standing relatively
a close by in using at times lethal or
non-lethal means
of dispersion of violence
that erupted soon after
the armed confrontation began between
armed factions
in gaza and israeli forces and remember
that this
violence spreading throughout israel but
also palestinian territories is
precisely
what hamas had called for notably one of
its
leaders ismail haniyeh had asked when
speaking out of
qatar where he is staying at present
that palestinians all over join in
and especially those in the west bank
and that is
precisely uh what is happening right now
all right gallagher fenwick for us there
in jerusalem talking to us
about what we understand is happening
today in the west bank thank you very
much
indeed for bringing us up to speed we'll
keep watching all of those developments
for you in gaza in jerusalem
