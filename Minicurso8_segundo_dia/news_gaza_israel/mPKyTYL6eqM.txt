when weeds become a Lifeline common mow
is now one of the few remaining sources
of food for the people of
Gaza it is sold for 80 we pick it and
sell it we pick it and sell to people
there is no food no cooking no water
it's all starvation since the onslaught
began in early October Israel has
tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip
preventing food water and other
essential supplies from entering the
area humanitarian Aid convoys have been
obstructed by the Israeli authorities
with agencies complaining that far too
little is getting
through the world food program has
warned repeatedly of the risk of famine
in Gaza the proportion of households
facing severe food insecurity is the
highest ever recorded surpassing recent
Hunger crises in Yemen and
Afghanistan malnutrition also
exacerbates the already growing risk of
infectious disease as starving people
people are more vulnerable to
illness Gaza residents risk their lives
to go and collect the
mow the situation has become much worse
and we were forced to leave and go to
the Border there's no distance between
us and the tanks we put our lives in
danger but what can we do we have to
feed our children we have children who
want to eat better little than nothing
the tank could open fire at us but
despite that we go there to get cmon mow
these are called the land plants we get
common mow or other plants if someone is
sick we sometimes have infections
because of the lack of clean water so we
get some plants that we boil and then
drink Gaza is arid and has typically
relied heavily on food imports to feed
its densely packed population of 2.3
million but mow grows in the strip's dry
conditions requiring little
water while the plant has medicinal
properties it is not typically eaten as
food that people are using it to survive
is further evidence of their desperate
