i want to address
the recent allegations that have been
made
against me as you probably know the
attorney general is doing an independent
review and i will fully cooperate
with that review now the lawyers say
i shouldn't say anything when you have a
pending review
until that review is over i understand
that
i'm a lawyer too but
i want new yorkers to hear
from me directly on this
first i fully support
a woman's right to come forward
and i think it should be encouraged in
every way
i now understand that i
acted in a way that made people
feel uncomfortable
it was unintentional and i
truly and deeply apologize for it
i feel awful about
it and frankly
i am embarrassed by it
and that's not easy to say but that's
the truth
but this is what i want you to know and
i want you to know this from me
directly i never touched
anyone inappropriately
i never touched anyone inappropriately
i never knew at the time that
i was making anyone feel
uncomfortable i never knew
at the time i was making anyone feel
uncomfortable and
i certainly never ever
meant to offend anyone
or hurt anyone or cause
anyone any pain
that is the last thing i would ever want
to do
i asked the people of this state
to wait for the facts from the attorney
general's report
before forming an opinion
get the facts please before
forming an opinion and the attorney
general is doing that review
i will fully cooperate with it and then
you will have the facts
and make a decision when you know the
facts
i also want you to know that
i have learned from what has been
an incredibly uh difficult situation
for me as well as other people
and i've learned an important lesson
i'm sorry i'm sorry
for whatever pain i caused anyone i
never
intended it
and i will be the better for this
experience
thank you
