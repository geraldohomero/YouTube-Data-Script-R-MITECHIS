but this is a
humanitarian crisis which is not a
natural disaster it's not a flood it's
not a Heth Quake is a
man-made and when we look for
alternative ways of providing support by
sea by air we have to remind that we
have to do it because the natural way of
providing support through road is being
closed artificially closed
an estoration is being used as a war
arm and when we condemn this happening
in Ukraine we have to use the same words
for what's happening in Gaza
continue asking and more than asking
Israel to not to impend humanitarian
support to go through the natural way
which is by road and in the meantime
let's try for other solution which will
be less efficient and never an
alternative to the hundreds of tracks
that they should come into Gaza to avoid
the starvation of hundreds of thousand
of people but let me remind
something unra exist because they are
Palestinian
refugees is not a present to the
Palestinians is an answer to their needs
unra exist because first they were
Palestinian
refugees and we won't make these
refugees
disappears by by making unra disappear
they will still be
there in fact there is only one way to
make unra
disappear making those refugees citizens
of a Palestinian state that coexist with
an Israeli
estate the two-state solution we talk
about it many years ago and now we talk
it again but
admittedly we have never seriously tried
to make make it a
reality and in order to make it a
reality the first step should be an
unanimous resolution by this Security
Council endorsing a two-stage solution
and defining the general principles
which may lead to this result and on
that European Union is ready to
cooperate
