THAT WE STAND WITH OUR ALLIES
THERE.
BACK TO YOU.
CHARLIE: WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT
THIS A MINUTE AGO.
IT IS TRUE THIS IN A WHOLE ARRAY
OF CATASTROPHES GOING ALL WRONG
IN THE WORLD YOU CAN MAKE
ARGUMENT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED
AT A PRESIDENT TRUMP IT IS
POLICIES.
JACKIE: ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN MAKE
THE ARGUMENT AND HE WOULD MAKE
HIMSELF A PRESIDENT BIDEN WOULD
BE WILLING TO GET UP AND DEBATE
HIM.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE
HAVE TWO PRESIDENTS WITH A TRACK
RECORD AND THEY COULD GO TOE TO
TOE ON EACH ISSUE.
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THE
HANDLERS DON'T WANT BIDEN ON THE
STAGE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN HE'S OFF
SCRIPT.
CHARLIE: I CAN'T THINK OF
ANYTHING MORE IMPORTANT IN A
FULSOME DEBATE ON THIS.
MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS GOT TOGETHER
AND SEND LETTER TO THE
CANDIDATES AND SAY IT'S TOO
EARLY FOR INDENTATIONS FOR ANY
CANDIDATES.
IT'S NOT TOO EARLY FOR
CANDIDATES WHO EXPECTED MEET THE
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TO PUBLICLY
STATE THEIR SUPPORT AND
INTENTION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
COMMISSIONS DEBATES PLANNED FOR
THIS FALL.
COULD YOU IMAGINE IN 2024, TWO
PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND
NOT DEBATING.
>> THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
IS ALREADY SET FOR SEPTEMBER.
YOU CAN ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT
HAVE A DEBATE AND YOU'RE NOT.
I'LL JUST TELL YOU WHAT I THINK,
THIS IS MY OWN THEORY AND I CAN
BE COMPLETELY WRONG.
I THINK THE BIDEN FULLY INTENDS
TO DEBATE AND WANTS EVERYONE TO
TUG, BAKE AND PLEAD SO PEOPLE
WILL PLAY DOWN AND SAY HE'S
HOLDING OUT BECAUSE HE CAN'T DO
IT AND SET THE EXPECTATION SO
LOW AND HE OVER DELIVERS.
CHARLIE: IF THE MEDIA DOES NOT
GO CRAZY OVER THIS IS
MALPRACTICE ON THEIR PART.
>> I THINK PRESIDENT BIDEN
REFUSING TO COMMIT TO A DEBATE
IS THE MOST ANTIDEMOCRATIC THING
THAT I CAN CERTAINLY SEE.
HE CAN'T JUST HAVE A MAR-A-LAGO
THAT LIKE PEOPLE BEING ON SOCIAL
MEDIA PANDERING TO YOUR BASE.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN OPEN
DIALOGUE AND IN THE FORM OF
DEBATE IN THE PRECIPICE OF A
WORLD WAR III, ESSENTIALLY
BECAUSE POLICIES THAT BIDEN
ROLLED BACK FROM TRUMP THIS IS
THE PERFECT TIME TO SAY WHOSE
POLICIES WERE BETTER WHERE WOU
