How have these strikes unfolded over the
last few days?
Any signs that being effective?
The US struck three different countries
over the past this weekend, actually,
and the impact of that remains to be
seen in terms of retaliatory strikes
from the Iran backed groups.
We saw a report from Syria that a base
in there was struck by several drones,
by a Iran backed group.
The US hasn't confirmed that, though.
The Houthis did say they're not going to
be deterred and this is not going to
change their strategy in terms of
disrupting the Red Sea shipping.
And they say they will continue to
attack ships linked to the US, UK and
Israel.
And they say that these strikes by the
US didn't even impact their military
capability and they're going to build
more on that.
The impact also is that the US is
sending a very strong message targeting
58 strikes, 58 targets in Iraq and Syria
and the Houthis as well over the
weekend.
So this is a strong message saying we
won't stand idle when there are
casualties as a result from any strikes
on our on our troops.
Yeah, From the US side, officials there
reiterating they do not want to be
pulled into a prolonged conflict in the
region.
Where do the risks of that stand right
now?
Well, the risk is the US getting pulled
into this wider conflict in the region
as Iran tries to play out this
asymmetrical warfare everywhere else.
So they're striking Iraq.
The US air strike in Iraq, Syria, the
Houthis.
Of course, that's Yemen.
And so the risk still remains that, you
know, the US is going to get pulled into
this despite the fact that US officials
are saying this is not the aim and not
the target.
Some see that there was could be on oil,
but for now the market seems relaxed.
As long as the US of course, doesn't
target anything inside Iran that drags
Iran into kind of a direct conflict with
the US.
There is robust supply and in the market
for oil and the dominant impact on that
would definitely be a potential or a
possible cease fire between Israel and
Hamas.
