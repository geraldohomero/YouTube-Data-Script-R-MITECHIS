West Bank
the father of five had to move to true
Messiah with his family to escape
Israeli settler attacks
Abu Rashid says the harassment took many
different forms
the settlers started to fly drones over
us and while we were sleeping they would
land them on our homes
then they would activate sound effects
like alarms the sound of wailing or an
ambulance so we wake up terrified
the children start crying thinking that
the Army has invaded the place
it says incidents like this have had a
profound psychological impact on these
children
the children have become afraid of them
when they pass in front of someone in
the vicinity they cry and scream
ultimately we had to leave because
settlers came from 7am sitting and
sometimes sleeping in the house to
harass us
if one of them wanted a drink they would
go to the refrigerator and help
themselves as if the house belonged to
them
Eber rashid's family is just one of 12
dead flat settler attacks like this
all together around 89 Palestinians
including 39 children have left the
region
that's meant Israeli settlers have taken
over this lens and established a
wineyard next to a military base Abu
Rashid says he doesn't want to see
what's happening in rasatin now he also
thinks settlers would assault him once
again if he returned the Norwegian
Refugee Council one of the ngos
monitoring settler attacks reports that
Israeli security forces are preventing
russet teen residents from accessing
their lands
some 60 Palestinian communities are also
threatened by forced eviction and occupy
West Bank due to the threat of violence
from settlers and the military
the UN says since 2022 at least 488
Palestinians including 263 children have
been forcibly displaced from areas in
the Occupy West Bank the Norwegian
Refugee Council says Israel isn't
providing security to Palestinian
communities as the protected People
Israel as the occupying power should be
providing for their well-being and
should and has an obligation to prevent
these settler attacks
um and and protect Palestinians from
from physical violence Abu rashid's
family stays are also numbered in his
new home in two Messiah he said he has
to find another place for his family as
they settled on agricultural land
and that will make him a refugee once
again
