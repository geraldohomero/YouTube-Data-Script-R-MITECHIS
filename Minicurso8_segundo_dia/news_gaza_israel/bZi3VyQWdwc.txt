UNFOLDED.
THE MILITANT GROUP HAMAS
CALLING FOR A DAY OF RAGE
ACROSS THE ARAB WORLD AND
BEYOND.
IN THE WAKE OF A RELENTLESS
BOMBING OF THE GAZA STRIP BY
ISRAEL AFTER HAMAS'S GRUESOME
ATTACK.
TENS OF THOUSANDS TAKING TO THE
STREETS ACROSS THE REGION.
IN AFGHANISTAN, PROTESTERS
DESECRATING THE ISRAELI FLAG,
THEIR SIGNS READ ISRAEL IS THE
BIGGEST TERRORIST.
BUT, THE ANGER NOT DIRECTED AT
ISRAEL ALONE.
IN IRAN, ISRAELI AND AMERICAN
FLAGS BURNED.
IN JORDAN, RIOT POLICE CRASHING

PROTESTERS.
THE MASSIVE CROWDS STRETCHING
FOR BLOCKS TO THE CAPITAL CITY,
THE PROTESTS, AS TEARS GROW.

LEFT 241 AMERICANS DEAD.
THE U.S. BLAMED HEZBOLLAH FOR

>> [ SPEAKING IN A GLOBAL
LANGUAGE ]  VIOLENCE COULD IT
-- COULD UPEND THE REGION.
IT COULD BRING FORCE AGAINST
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT THAT
COULD DWARF THAT OF HAMAS.
IT HAS A MORE POWERFUL
MILITARY.
IT HAS BEEN BLOODIED ON ITS
FIGHTS IN SYRIA FOR THE BETTER
PART OF THE PAST DECADE AND ITS
LEADERS AND SOLDIERS ENJOY
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WITHIN
LEBANON AND HAVE A REAL
POLITICAL BASE.
IT CONTROLS PORTS AND AIRPORTS
TO BRING IN WEAPONS AND OTHER
