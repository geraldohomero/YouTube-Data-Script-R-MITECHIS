What is happening among the forces
Israelis and group forces
extremist has never generated a new
Wave of anti -Semitism in various parts
We have seen it for example in
our country too and in Canada this
situation was not exceptional in fact
The
anti -Semitic violence and before this
Context The Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudo condemned violence
recent after they were made
shots in two Jewish schools in
Monterreal during the night there was also
clashes between students in a
University of the same city at the last
Wednesday and there is something that is
closely linked to young people in fact
Here in Argentina and that's why we cite it
Only in a party there were also huh
Costumes linked to anti -Semitism
for example hate messages that
circulated is a kind of trend
that now returns more strongly and eh
makes more present among young people not
As we can see for example in this
school where the attacker is believed
I would also be 22 years old there were no injuries
Fortunately it is not clear if
incidents are related to some
anti -Semitic organization particularly
But definitely lights the
alarms on Wednesday for example in a
University there was an altercation between
alienated people with opposite sides in
The conflict between Israel and the strip of
Gaza and to the point came to the discussion
that there were injured had to intervene
Police also with which we are
attending a new wave of
Anti -Semitic Violence in Toronto Canada
Police reported that crimes of
I hate against Jews and Muslims had
more than duplicate the figure for the whole
2023 And that we are just
averaging the month of November with what
which we still have the last part of the
year where this figure could
Increase and this definitely
worries the authorities
Government
Yo
