FRIENDS, CLOSE FRIENDS, LOTS OF
FAMILY MEMBERS.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
WE KNOW THAT ARE KIDNAPPED AND
NOW IN GAZA.
WE WENT THROUGH HORROR, REALLY
I'M JUST LIKE -- I'M 24 AND I
NEVER IMAGINED SOMETHING LIKE
THIS WOULD HAPPEN EVER IN A
DANCE, IN A MUSIC FESTIVAL.
WE CELEBRATED LOVE AND WE
DANCED, AND IT WAS AMAZING, AND
THEN THE ROCKETS STARTED AND
GUNSHOTS EVERYWHERE.
WE MANAGED TO ESCAPE, BUT THERE
WERE A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT
DIDN'T, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
FRIENDS THAT ARE KEPT CAPTIVE
NOW IN GAZA, AND WE WERE SAVED
BY MIRACLE BUT THERE ARE FRIENDS
THAT WE LOVE THAT WEREN'T.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF
THERE'S ANY WAY TO HELP LIKE
FIRST PRIORITY, FIRST PRIORITY
ARE OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT
ARE NOW IN GAZA.
WE'RE STRONG HERE, WE'RE
POWERFUL HERE IN THIS PLACE NOW
POWERFUL HERE IN THIS PLACE NOW
IN TEL AVIV AND EVERYWHERE.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

GO THROUGH THIS.

ALSO TELLING YOUR STORIES MAKES
A BIG DIFFERENCE TOO.
THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW THIS.
