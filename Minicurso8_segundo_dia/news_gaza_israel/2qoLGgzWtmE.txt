A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THE MARKET
HAS MORE WISDOM THAN THE FEW
FOLKS AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE
BOARD.
WE WANT TO GO TO THE REGION
ITSELF WHERE ALL THE ACTION IS.
DANNY DID ON IS IN ISRAEL AND A
FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS.
HE JOINS ME FROM TEL AVIV, AND
GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
I WANT TO GO TO YOUR FORMER
ASSIGNMENT AT THE UNITED
NATIONS.
THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UN
CAME OUT WITH A STATEMENT AND I
WANT TO READ ONE LINE FROM HIS
STATEMENT, WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF
THE ABYSS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
IS YOUR ASSESSMENT APTLY?
>> I HOPE NOT BECAUSE WE ARE
FOCUSED ON FIGHTING AGAINST
HAMAS AND WE'VE SEEN THE
BRUTALITY AND THE ACTING EXACTLY
LIKE ISIS SO WE HAVE GOT TO
ESCALATE THE SITUATION IN THE
NORTH BUT YOU SEE WHAT IS
HAPPENING THE FORCES COMING FROM
BEIRUT FROM HEZBOLLAH FROM
TEHRAN ALL OF THOSE BAD GUYS ARE
GETTING IN ISRAEL NOW SO WE ARE
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT
IT WILL BE A MULTI-FRONT WAR.
WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT BE THE
CASE BUT WE ARE TAKING THAT INTO
CONSIDERATION AND WE WILL BE
READY FOR THAT.
DAVID: YOU MENTIONED THE KNESSET
IS UNITED.
THERE WAS A LOT OF POLITICAL
ANIMOSITY AND IS NOT UNUSUAL IN
A DEMOCRACY GOING ON IN ISRAEL
BEFORE THE ATTACK BY HAMAS, THE
TERRORIST ATTACK BY THE
TERRORIST INSTITUTION OF HAMAS.
ARE THOSE RIVALRIES UNDER THE
RUG AND IS THE KNESSET UNITED
ALL PARTIES INCLUDED?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
NOT ONLY THE KNESSET I JUST CAME
FROM THERE FROM THE STUDIO AND
WE STOOD TOGETHER AND WE'RE
GOING TO FIGHT TOGETHER AND
WE'RE GOING TO PUT ALL THE
DIFFERENCES ASIDE BUT THE PEOPLE
OF ISRAEL TOGETHER IT IS AMAZING
TO SEE THE NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS
AND PEOPLE STOPPING EVERYTHING
THAT THEY'RE DOING AND WE COME
TOGETHER TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS.
WE DEFEND AND FIGHT FOR OUR
LIVES AND WE STAND BEHIND THEM.
TODAY WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY
WHEN WERE UNDER ATTACK TO COME
TOGETHER TO BE UNITED AND I
THINK HER ENEMIES MADE A HUGE
MISTAKE.
THE BRUTALITY NOW WE COUNTED
1400 PEOPLE WHO WERE MASSACRED
ON THE BODY SATURDAY IN MORE
THAN 200 PEOPLE KIDNAPPED INTO
GAZA AND WE SEE THE HORRIBLE
FOOTAGE COMING FROM GAZA BUT WE
ARE STRONG AND WE WILL PREVAIL
AND WE WILL DEFEAT HAMAS.
I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT THIS TIME WE HAVE TO GO ALL
THE WAY WE HAVE TO FINISH THE
JOB WE CANNOT GO HALFWAY AND
THEN THE UN AND MAYBE THE U.S.
WILL PUSH US AND SAY THAT'S HAVE
