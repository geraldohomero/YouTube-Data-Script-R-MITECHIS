as Gaza grapples underneath barges of
rockets and bombings and the death toll
continues to climb Global demonstrations
have created a divide of their very own
marches around the world are seeing both
parties garnering support and
withstanding condemnation through the
week Americans have held pro-israel and
pro Palestinian demonstrations across
the country on Sunday the Jewish
community of New Jersey expressed
support for Israeli military action in
Gaza TI
this is not just a Jewish thing this is
an American thing when 911 when 911
happened we all together protested
together and we realized it was Islamic
Terror and Islamic Terror needs to be
uprooted and destroyed and that's why
we're out here together but down south
in Texas hundreds took to the streets in
support of Palestinians carrying flags
and Banners calling for
Freedom well the support transcended
across the the globe to Pakistan were
thousands of supporters of the country's
largest islamist party jamaat islami
joined an anti-israel March in Karachi
they waved Palestinian flags and carot
signs which R I'm quoting here free
Palestine to express their
support

meanwhile India also saw support for
Israelis and sloganeering against the
militant group Hamas the condemnation
for hamas's attacks continued in Brazil
as well where demonstrators and near the
beach there call for peace and honor of
the victims in a show of support for
[Music]
Israel
but Pro Palestine demonstrations were
also seen across Europe thousands took
to the streets of Copenhagen Berlin and
Amsterdam in support of Gaza the marches
came even as Germany and France recently
banned Pro Palestinian
demonstrations
I think the whole phobia of being
anti-semitic is the whole reason
and this whole idea that the whole
occupation is hiding
hiding behind this this religion is
false and you can see that and you can
see a lot of Jewish groups that are pro
Palestinians inside the West Bank inside
Israel itself
in America and you can see how the
Israel's Army treat them
so yeah it's it's it's a kind of phobia
and I understand that I understand that
through the history that what happened
in

Europe
