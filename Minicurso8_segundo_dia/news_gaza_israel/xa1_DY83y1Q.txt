.
YEAH IT'S BROKEN. COMPLETELY
BROKEN. TAKING US BACKWARDS.
ANOTHER SUBJECT, HILLARY
CLINTON. SHE IS CALLING FOR THE
ELIMINATION. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT
WORD, THE ELIMINATION OF HAMAS.
SHE SAYS A CEASE FIRE WOULD GIVE
HAMAS A CHANCE TO REARM. LOOKS
LIKE THE ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS
ARE FIRMLY, FIRMLY BEHIND
ISRAEL. YOU SAW AT THAT MARCH
YESTERDAY A TERRIFIC PERFORMANCE
FROM ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS AND
I THINK THE HAMAS LOBBY AS I
WILL CALL THEM, THE SQUAD. THERE
WERE ACED OUT OF THIS, MAY HAVE
A TURNING POINT HERE. YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, SHE'S SHE'S RIGHT. OF
COURSE. AND SHE BASES IT ON HER
OWN EXPERIENCE AS SECRETARY OF
STATE AND AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS
REACHED WITH HAMAS AT ONE POINT.
AND THEY PROMPTLY BROKE THAT
CEASE FIRE. SHE SAYS, YOU KNOW,
THEY'LL CONTINUE TO BE A THREAT
TO ISRAEL FOREVER FOR IF THEY'RE
NOT ELIMINATED. SO SHE'S MAKING
SENSE FROM HER EXPERIENCE.
OBVIOUSLY AND I DO THINK WHAT'S
INTERESTING IS YOU'RE SEEING
THIS SORT OF MIDDLE THAT IS KIND
OF FORMED. RIGHT. I THINK YOU'RE
PROBABLY GOING TO ALSO
EVENTUALLY HAVE SOME PEOPLE ON
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, WHICH WE'VE
SEEN IN UKRAINE, NOT WANT TO BE
TOO INVOLVED. RIGHT SO THE
ISOLATIONIST WING VERSUS THE
SORT OF MORE HAWKISH WING, FOR
LACK OF A BETTER WORD. SO
THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING
POLITICAL DYNAMICS GOING ON WITH
THESE TWO WARS THAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS ON HIS PLATE RIGHT
NOW. IT WAS GOOD TO SEE THE
DEMOCRATS, THE DEMOCRAT
LEADERSHIP, THE ESTABLISHMENT
FIRMLY BEHIND ISRAEL AND THE
LEADERSHIP OF THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY, FIRMLY BEHIND ISRAEL. IT
WAS GOOD TO SEE THAT UNITY,
ESPECIALLY AT THAT RALLY OF
300,000 PEOPLE. I THINK THAT'S A
TURNING POINT. THAT'S A THAT'S A
CHANGE OF DIRECTION FOR OUR
UNDERSTANDING OF ISRAEL
UNDERSTANDING FOR AMERICAN
POLITICS.
>> THESE PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCE
IN THE DEEP EXPERIENCE IN ISSUES
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH HILARY
CLINTON OR NOT ON A LOT OF
THINGS SHE UNDERSTANDS THE
DYNAMIC IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND
THAT'S WHAT'S LACKING YOU CAN GO
BACK TO THE EDUCATION QUESTION
ON THIS WITH A LOT OF THE YOUNG
PEOPLE AND WHY DON'T THINK HAV
