It is the result of an air attack in
Rafa a sadly familiar scene
rescuers taking bodies from among the
rubble everything was calm here
There were problems attacks are
arbitrary around one million and
Half of Palestinians have risen here
fleeing Israeli operations in
North Rafa is the last refuge of the
Strip where food shortages and
medicines threatens with an imminent
famine and propagation of diseases
It is not clear how long they can
stay here displaced or how
insurance are on the map indicate the
areas where Israel has carried out
Terrestrial operations in Gaza with
troops approaching
Rafa but so far Israel has only
attacked the city by
air in other places continue
fierce land fighting against
Objectives around the city of Gaza
and have yunis the patience of the allies
The United States and Germany exhausts
They have warned Israel that the invasion
Rafa's land would cross a line
Red the Secretary of State
American Anthony Blinken visited the
last week the region with a message
Of course you run the risk of killing more
civilians that humanitarian aid
suffer more damage also runs the
Risk of even more isolating Israel
endangering your safety and
long -term position
But Israel continues to ignore the calls
of his closest allies states that
will fulfill its goal of eliminating ever
which means that I would have to invade
Raf√° although this deepens the gap
With states
United we have no way to defeat
Never without entering Rafa told
Blinken Secretary I want to do it
with the support of the United States but
We will do it we will do it
alone
Israel states that it will transfer to the
Rafa's civilians to humanitarian islands in
different areas of Gaza but has not
Specified these plans
