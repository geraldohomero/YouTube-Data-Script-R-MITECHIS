BLAZE HAS GROWN TO 812
KILOMETRES SINCE BEING SPARKED
LATE SUNDAY.
>>> AND HAITI IS FACING MORE
DEVASTATION WITH THE ARRIVAL OF
TROPICAL STORM GRACE.
THE DEPRESSION REGAINED STORM
STATUS OVERNIGHT.
HEAVY RAIN AND STRONG WINDS
WHIPPED THE AREA HIT HARDEST BY
SATURDAY'S EARTHQUAKE.
THE DEATH TOLL IN HAITI HAS NOW
CLIMBED TO 1,419 AND THE NUMBER
OF INJURED HAS GROWN TO 6,000.
CTV'S OMAR SACHEDINA HAS MORE
FOR US FROM PORT-AU-PRINCE.
>> Reporter: AS YOU CAN SEE
THE WEATHER IS MUCH CLEARER THAN
IT WAS YESTERDAY AFTER TROPICAL
DEPRESSION GRACE POUNDED AND
DRENCHED HAITI, AND WE STILL
DON'T KNOW THE FULL IMPACT OF
THAT.
THERE WERE THREATS OF LANDSLIDES
AND FLOODING AND THAT IS ON TOP
OF AN ALREADY COMPLICATED SEARCH
AND RESCUE EFFORT.
WE KNOW THAT THE UNITED NATIONS
HAS BEEN TRYING TO NEGOTIATE
ACCESS TO THE EPICENTER IN TERMS
OF BRINGING FOOD AND SUPPLIES.
THE MAIN ROAD THAT LEADS TO THE
HARDEST HIT AREAS IS CONTROLLED
BY GANGS SO IT IS VERY DIFFICULT
AND DANGEROUS TO BE ABLE TO
BRING SUPPLIES INTO THAT REGION.
WE KNOW THAT THE HOSPITALS HAVE
A BASIC LACK OF SUPPLIES.
THEY ARE OVERRUN IN SOME CASES.
WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING
OUTSIDE IN SOCCER FIELDS.
AND THIS IS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING
ELSE THIS COUNTRY HAS SUFFERED
IN THE LAST LITTLE WHILE.
THE ASSASSINATION OF THE
PRESIDENT, THE COVID PANDEMIC.
THERE ARE STILL FEW VACCINES IN
THIS COUNTRY.
500,000 DOSE INSIDE A COUNTRY OF
11 MILLION PEOPLE.
HAITI IS ONE OF THE POOREST
COUNTRIES IN THE WESTERN
HEMISPHERE.
IN THE BEST OF TIMES RESOURCES
ARE DIFFICULT TO COME BY AND NOW
ADD THIS AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW
COMPLICATED THE SITUATION
BECOMES.
THE DEATH TOLL HAS SOARED PAST
1,400 AN
