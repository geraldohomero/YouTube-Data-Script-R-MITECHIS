Let's start with this 24 -hour trick
between Israel and never violated
It is not clear to what extent
This could affect negotiations
that they are being carried out in Egypt like this
that José Levi has been investigating the
Topic what have you found Jose good day
Hi Lucía Good morning has been during
This 24 -hour truce that in theory
You have to expire only within six
that Palestinian militias apparently
According to the Israelis they launched three
projectiles against the interior of Israel
against the Bercheva area there
They exploded in open areas there was no
victims but Israelis talk about
a clear violation by the
militias of this truce and then for
One side decided to resume attacks
against the interior of Gaza in total a
dozen attacks five of them in the
North of Gaza five in the south but
They have also attacked what would be
Projectile launch zones
that in this case they would be in territories
open with which we do not have
knowledge of victims in the other
side and parallel too
They decided to order the delegation
Palestine that is the Israeli delegation
who was negotiating in Cairo with
the Palestinians negotiations that are
still mediated by Egypt to return
To Israel then what they say in
The movement is never that they do not
They have knowledge of any missiles
launched from Gaza by militias against
The interior of Israel blame Israel from
to have been the one that with its air attacks
violated this truce what is that a
CNN team present in Gaza was
Witness of what the three were
Missiles The three projectiles launched
From the territory of Gaza against
Israel that would have broken the truce
Now what is unknown is if
This means the total failure of
negotiations if it means the end of the
truce for now we are not seeing that
This exchange of fire is carrying
At a total open escalation in the area
and it is even said that
negotiations not necessarily to
get to some kind of result the
Israeli team has to be in the
Cairo there are telephones there are other
means to communicate or not
discard the possibility that you can
get to some type of
Understanding although the possibilities
They are really low
