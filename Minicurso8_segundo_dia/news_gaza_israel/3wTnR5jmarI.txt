6 and 30 in the morning is a good thing
Singular in Israeli history we are
Start with new things and talk about business
And stuff like that This is a mistake, we need to make first
Destroy the Hamas focus on that and also wait with
The kidnappers didn't delay anything Because of the kidnappers
The most important thing now is to focus the action in Gaza
And to wipe out the entire northern Gaza Strip, I will work
A bellhop when we see it The pictures of a million
The people of Gaza are walking with white flags south
That's one of the targets that's a psychological target
This operation First and foremost, this is an event
This strategic temporary is first and foremost an event
Operations should understand we have a lot in there Very much so
Our fighters who need to operate on the ground are very, very strong
It's crowded to operate in a crowded area like where you are that is
The population will want to Cut down
A female thank-you number or it'll be a temporary thing
Where they go
Back up we're actually rolling the Neck now Bette
Raz, if you want a female, this is female
Operationally strong, there is no way to wage war
As the audience wants To run it inside Gaza territory when
The crowds are between the tanks and the soldiers
This is a female Aza Abi Dichter named Teza 20 23 and that
And that will end up being your own ejections
Says they're not going back to Gaza City. Look
No, I'm not I don't know. I don't know what it's like
It will end eventually because you will remember that the city is Gaza
Sitting on a third Half the population, but
One-third of the Gaza Strip has two-thirds of the total number of camps
There are six other refugee camps in the city
In the northern part there are only two refugee camps and say
You can do this whenever I get a chance to have a pet
It is dangerous for the State of Israel It was dangerous and he was
Even more dangerous now that's like you
Hear Danny's picking up materials right now right about
My commander So our employer's bow can
You can do a unit campaign and you can hang here
Flags across the country and speak
On units but the Prime Minister is disintegrating us
Disrupting us and he's hurting the army that the commanders of
The army and the heads of the bank know That commander's.
