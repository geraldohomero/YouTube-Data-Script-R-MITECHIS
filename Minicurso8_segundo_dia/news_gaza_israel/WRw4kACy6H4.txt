what mentioned in the airport that i'm
allowed to leave you are not detaining

we were in south africa in botswana on
vacation my family my 28 30 year old
daughters are with me here we arrived uh
sunday morning by ethiopia we got a
negative test in south africa on
uh friday we got a negative test in
ethiopia saturday we uh we tested again
here
at pearson on sunday and we're here
until it comes back until the results
come back and they're telling us 48 to
72 hours so we've been here
over 48 hours now
one of the questions that we keep asking
ourselves is why does it take 70 72
hours for testing
in toronto when in other places
it's hours
we're instructed to leave the waste
whatever we don't eat in the room and
they pick it up the next day so there's
nine bags of discarded food partially
eaten food and we
live with that in the room
[Music]
it's been a worrisome process ever since
and
expensive as well as i had to uh cancel
my
lm flight book a whole new flight
through germany i don't know what's
gonna happen at the moment uh i guess
we'll see in the coming few days but
yeah
i had to book rebook my flight about
four times now so
hopefully i don't have to do that again
there's a lot of other people you know
on their work permits that are stuck
here uh you know that work permits
expire in the next two three weeks that
won't be able to go you know those
people sold all their homes they left
their jobs so they're also stranded it's
not just you know the canadian citizens
and uh permanent residents like myself
it's also people
you know that are coming there to start
a new life in canada and uh yeah it's
just it's sad for everyone you know a
lot of people are going through a very
hard time at the moment
