.
>> Lawrence: GOT TO GET THIS 
UNDER CONTROL, THEY DESERVE 
BETTER.
ANOTHER FOX NEWS ALERT, SMOKE 
RISING IN GAZA, WE ARE IN WHAT 
COULD BE FINAL DAY OF TEMPORARY 
CEASEFIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 
HAMAS.
>> Ainsley: A SIXTH SET OF 
HOSTAGES EXPECTED TO BE RELEASE 
TODAY, JOINING 60 PLUS FREED SO 
FAR.
>> Steve: WHITE HOUSE HOPE 
AMERICANS WILL BE INCLUDED IN 
THIS BATCH AFTER NONE WERE 
RELEASED YESTERDAY.
>> Brian: GREG PALKOT, HI, GREG.
>> Greg: WE ARE IN TEL AVIV AT 
VARIOUS HOSPITALS IN THE AREA.
THE RELEASED HOSTAGES BEING 
TREATED AFTER HORRIBLE TREATMENT
AT THE HANDS OF HAMAS IN GAZA 
STRIP.
12 FREED OVERNIGHT, TELLING 
HORROR STORIES.
FOR WEEKS, LITTLE FOOD, LITTLE 
LIGHT, UNSANITARY CONDITION.
ONE YOUNG MAN TOLD OF BEATINGS 
AND BEING FORCED TO WATCH 
TORTURE VIDEOS.
IT IS BELIEVED ANOTHER 160 
REMAIN HELD BY HAMAS AND OTHER 
GROUPS, AMONG THEM 10-MONTH-OLD 
KFIR AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS.
A RELATIVE TOLD YOU FOLKS 
ISRAELI GOVERNMENTS THEY WON'T 
BE RELEASED TODAY.
>> WE TRY TO REMAIN HOPEFUL.
WE CONTINUE WITH OUR BATTLE AND 
EFFORTS AS A FAMILY, AS A UNITED
FAMILY TO TRY AND GET SOME 
ANSWERS.
>> Griff: STRONG STUFF, 
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS ARE BEING 
RELEASED, WORKED ON RIGHT NOW, 
ISRAEL AND HAMAS GO-BETWEEN 
EXTENSION OF THE CEASEFIRE AND 
HOSTAGE EXCHANGE SET TO END 
OVERNIGHT.
HUMANITARIAN AID BEING BROUGHT 
TO THE BATTERED GAZA STRIP WITH 
MOST FIGHTING, IT IS CHANCE TO 
REACH PEOPLE THERE AMIDST THE 
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.
BABY KFIR AND HIS FAMILY MIGHT 
NOT BE RELEASED EASILY.
THEY ARE BEING HELD BY ANOTHER 
MILITANT GROUP IN GAZA.
THAT JUST SHOWS HOW COMPLICATED 
THE SITUATION IS.
DIPLOMATS ARE FIGHTING FOR MORE 
TIME BEFORE FULL-SCALE FIGHTING 
COULD RESUME IN GAZA.
BACK TO YOU.
>> Lawrence: THANKS.
