MISTER PRESIDENT, CAN YOU TELL
US ABOUT THE, --
STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY FOR
SUPPORT?
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN, JUST
ADDRESSING THE NATION, IN THE
WAKE OF HAMAS ATTACKS ON ISRAEL,
WITH.
I WANT TO BRING THAT NBC NEWS
CORRESPONDENT, ALLIE RAFFA.
ALSO WITH --
US PETER BAKER.
ALI, THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT
THE U.S. HAS ISRAEL'S BACK,
SAYING THAT ISRAEL HAS THE
RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF, FULL
SPOT.
BUT ALSO, ALI, THE PRESIDENT
CONFIRMING THAT ENTIRE FAMILIES
ARE AMONG THOSE TAKEN HOSTAGE
IN GAZA.
>> YEAH LINDSAY, A VERY
POWERFUL MESSAGE, IN A VERY
SHORT SPAN OF TIME.
AND THESE REMARKS FROM
PRESIDENT BIDEN, IN THE WHITE
HOUSE, JUST A MINUTE AGO.
AND AS YOU MENTIONED, HE TALKED
ABOUT THE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS
THE COMMUNICATION BY HIS
ADMINISTRATION, AS WELL AS
HIMSELF PERSONALLY, SINCE THIS
CRISIS STARTED, EARLIER THIS
MORNING.
BUT HE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE
HUMAN ASPECT OF THAT, THESE
IMAGES THAT AMERICANS HAVE BEEN
SEEING, PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
HAVE BEEN SEEING --
.
THESE IMAGES OF JUST THE
DEVASTATION CAUSED BY THIS
ATTACK, IN ISRAEL, BY HAMAS
MILITANTS.
AND HE REITERATED, AS HE TALKED
ABOUT, WHAT HE SAID EARLIER IN
THAT STATEMENT, AFTER HE HAD
THIS CALL WITH PRIME MINISTER
NETANYAHU, THAT THE SUPPORT FOR
ISRAEL WILL CONTINUE.
HE CALLED IT UNWAVERING, ROCK
SOLID.
HE SAID, QUOTE, THE WORLD IS
WATCHING.
HE SAID HE SPOKE ALSO IF THE
KING OF JORDAN, MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS.
HE IS STILL COORDINATING WITH
MEMBERS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS ON NEXT STEPS HERE.
AND, HE ALSO VOWED TO CONTINUE
HAVING PERSONAL COMMUNICATION,
ONE-ON-ONE COMMUNICATION WITH
THE PRIME MINISTER, AS THIS
CONTINUES.
AND LINDSEY, IT CAN'T BE
UNDERSCORED ENOUGH, HOW
IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT THIS
ALLIANCE IS BETWEEN THE UNITED
STATES AND ISRAEL.
IT IS ONE OF OUR KEY ALLIANCES,
IT IS OUR STRONGEST ALLIANCE IN
THE MIDDLE EAST.
AND, IT ALSO IS EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT, AS FAR AS THE
STABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
SO, YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT
COMMIT TO CONTINUE HELPING
ISRAEL, FOR AS LONG AS IT NEEDS,
AND ANYWAY IT NEEDS.
BUT WE ARE STILL WAITING TO
HEAR WHAT EXACTLY THOSE ACTIONS
WILL ENTAIL.
WHAT COULD THE U.S. CONTINUE TO
DO, STEP WISE SPECIFICALLY, TO
CONTINUE HELPING ISRAEL?
SO THOSE ARE DEFINITELY THINGS
THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE
TO WATCH AND SEE.
AS THIS SITUATION --
IT CONTINUES TO BE VERY FLUID,
