The government
The alternative was Gangwon
Land
The government that forcibly closed the coal mine was abandoned.
Through the Special Act on Support,
I granted it with a casino
Kangwon Land is light over 20 years since its establishment
The funds raised in the area are as high as 2 trillion
300 million won, but it must be based on funds
Areas
Alternative business
Senior jobs in the welfare agency only these jobs
I created it. I can see this as a job
There is no gambling industry, such as gambling addiction
Dark shave on the area
Clearly, the demands of residents of the river area
The matters are simple instead of coal mines
Make a job to eat and live
I'm asking for another additional
If so, the casino business
Apply the total sales system
There is an annual estimated sales in advance
If the excess occurs, the following
It is to reduce sales more casinos
The same is true for days and business hours limitations
Even if you can make more money, you can't earn
It's nailed, but that's allocated to the area
Gangwon will also be reduced
Southern municipality or Gangwon Land Casino
I can no longer secure competitiveness
Judged
That's why overall
I can't recover the coroe hawks
The problem is that more serious than that
The 50 million Korean market
It's just completely broken. Now, market competition
On the system
Biting the conversion of complex resorts
Kangwon Land is only 13% of sales
Increase the proportion of Vikasino by 30%
This is a plan of 2.5 million won investment plan
Balhae Bureau Tourism Plan
And I decided to improve
I chose it on behalf of the phased forced waste
The casino industry has reached one for 20 years
With an intellectual area
In the absence of extinction, a new alternative
Need to find
This is a ytn Jihwan
