these women say they won't be silenced
and that they want their rights
respected by the israeli government
but their demand to live freely in
occupied east jerusalem has met stiff
opposition
now they're asking the international
community to support their cause through
advocacy and funding at a conference
titled we are all married after the
mother of jesus women
are suffering day in day out
especially those who are living in
around the bay democracy not just when
there are bombs or when there is wars
and so on but they are actually been
traumatized
been harassed being tortured
every minute
so this first thing the world must know
number two we must act
to press charge the israeli regime so
that this
injustice can stop
but demanding justice has proved costly
for many palestinian women
the group known as the murabita in
jerusalem protest for the right of
palestinians to have unrestricted access
to the al-aqsa mosque compound a holy
site in islam and judaism
some members have either been arrested
or jailed
they keep preventing muslims from
entering al-aqsa and at the same time
they allow settlers to break into
al-aqsa compound
they keep assassinate palestinian men
and women in jerusalem
more than 6 000 young people are in
jails of the israeli occupation
hanadi halawani says she's been banned
from praying at the mosque some of the
participants here say that palestinian
women living in the old city of
jerusalem are having their basic human
rights undermined including the freedom
of worship and movement and they say
it's time to rally international support
for them
the women here say this conference is a
step in the right direction though the
change they're seeking will require
major compromises from the israeli
government
