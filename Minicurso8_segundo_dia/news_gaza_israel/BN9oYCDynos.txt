[CC may contain inaccuracies] You talk about the path to prosperity
and peace in the region that we have to
try and find out of.
This
is normalization of relations, of
relations with Israel now off the table
for Saudi Arabia?
Obviously not this week.
But
when you when you think about that path,
you know, when those discussions were
taking place and his royal highness, the
crown prince was clear that it is
contingent on a pathway to peace,
peaceful resolution of the Palestinian
question, that that was on the table,
that remains on the table.
And obviously the setback over the last
month has brought that has clarified Why
was Saudi Arabia so adamant that
resolution of the Palestinian conflict
has to be part of a broader
normalization of the Middle East, which
again, goes back to the Arab peace plan
that was put forward by Saudi Arabia
decades ago, that that saw a way forward
for a for a normal Middle East, where in
all countries of the Middle East would
have
would have normal relationships and
would be focusing on economic
prosperity, which is which is the common
theme today from the regional transition
to a region of prosperity.
I think it reminds us of something that
has existed in the Middle East for many,
many decades, since the 1940s, which is
a big part of the Middle East.
The Palestinian people have had their
basic rights
taken away and the right for statehood
and peaceful existence unfulfilled.
And it's time to use this awful
situation now to bring that to the fore
and to resolve it.
Saudi Arabia has put forward the Arab
peace plan for a long time,
and we remain
eager to see that plan coming to
fruition through a peaceful process.
You will see this week, in the next few
days, Saudi Arabia convening an
emergency Arab summit in Riyadh.
You will see Saudi Arabia convening and
Africa, Saudi summit in Riyadh.
And in a few days you will see Saudi
Arabia convening an Islamic.
Stomach.
And in the short term, the objective of
bringing
these three summits and other gatherings
under the leadership of Saudi Arabia
would be to drive towards peaceful
resolution of the conflict.
