See the sea in Ashkan city of Israel
Constant in residential areas built along the shore
Hamas attacked rocket and bombing
Many buildings have been damaged
Trains parked on the shore are also enough
The loss has been said that it is said that
Glasses of vehicles parked on the streets also broken
Are the war between Yal and Hamas

I am present city city
But this city does not seem here now
It seems that the waste marks begin to reach
This is the closest to Gaja, this wisdom
Is a residential area of where
The rockets of Hamas coming out are falling
Watch the residential building here tomorrow morning
But this rocket came and hit a bomb and came
Was hit and because of which not only this
Building has damaged its ground
Floor First Floor has been damaged
Number rather rather top glass
Have gone to the area of the balcony too
Damage has been done in all these houses
Here is also the problem, if you see my left
These villas remain because it is the most
Cute area is the sea in front and
Living along the sea in the residential area
The fun is different, that's why expensive houses here
People remained a lot of flats for
Are luxurious flats but from gazes
Rocket left by Hamas now
They have become the cause of these people and
Seeing, a man is full of silence
Everyone will not be seen inside the safe house
Stayed because these vehicles stand
Was here see how much damage was done here
There are people who live in these flats
The edges of who took expensive flats
Their vehicles are also completely this explosion
I have been damaged and see these vehicles
All the damage has been done here for these trains here
All these vehicles have been damaged
It has happened and this is what the whole house is
Has been damaged but as soon as we
Come here
There is so much detainee here and so much police
It remains that many people reach here
