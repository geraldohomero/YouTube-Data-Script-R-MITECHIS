University students were in Burlington
Vermont for the Thanksgiving holidays
visiting the relatives of one of the
20-year-olds this photo is reported to
have been taken just before they went
for a walk two were wearing the cafea
the traditional Palestinian headdress as
scarves police say they have no
information as to a motive and the
gunman didn't say anything before
shooting but Among The Avenues of
Investigation whether this was a hate
crime the fact of the gunman did not
even shout then it makes matters even
worse because at that point somebody
just walking up to individuals we the
cafe and then shooting them for no
apparent reason it it's even now more
clear uh that it is a hate crime they
were not robbed uh it wasn't a domestic
violence uh situation and it's not
somebody that they know or somebody that
could have targeted them for any other
reason the three of graduates of a
