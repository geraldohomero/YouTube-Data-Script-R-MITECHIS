ACCUSING HIM OF SUPPORTING
GENOCIDE
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROTESTS AS
AN EXAMPLE OF DIVISION IN THE
COUNTRY.
>>> THE ISRAELI MILITARY HAS
RELEASED FOOTAGE THAT THEY SAY
SHOWS YAYA STIN WARHYA SINWAR UN
IT WAS RECENTLY DISCOVERED BY
THE ISRAELI ARMY IN GAZA
ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY, THE
MOST WANTED MAN IS SEEN HERE IN
A TUNNEL IN KHAN YUNIS ALONG
WITH HIS CHILDREN AND ONE HIS
WIVES.
FOR THE LATEST, LET'S GO LIVE TO

HI, CHAPMAN, GOOD MORNING.
HOW SURE ARE WE THAT THIS IN
