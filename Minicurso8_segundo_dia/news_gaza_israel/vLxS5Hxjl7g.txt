as a correspondent with al jazeera she
informed millions of arabic speakers
about israel-palestine after joining the
network in 1997.
and on thursday thousands of
palestinians carried shirin abu akla's
for her last journey
her body was transferred first to the
palestinian presidential palace where
thousands of people attended a state
service
was an honest and patriotic voice
she conveyed the suffering of the
families of palestinian martyrs the
suffering of jerusalem and the suffering
of our people in the camps
the murder of shireen abu aklah is not
the first crime of this kind with dozens
of palestinian journalists killed by
israeli forces
we hold the israeli occupation
authorities responsible for killing her
and they will not be able to change the
truth of this crime and it must not go
unpunished the president also voted to
take the case to international criminal
court
ebola's body was then transferred to a
hospital and occupied east jerusalem
until her burial
jivara budari was a colleague of abu
aklee she said she never expected she
would cover sheeran's killing one day
shireen is the martyr of words and
justice
and she was one of the eldest
palestinian tv correspondents in the
world she was my teacher my soul mate
she taught me the field work and what
journalism is palestinian journalists
who witnessed her killing said abu agle
was shot by the israeli army israel has
called for a joint investigation into
the incident which the palestinian
authority has refused
of course occupation doesn't admit even
massacres and how come they can admit
killing of a person we don't expect them
to admit but we know the message reached
the ears of the world
all the evidence
all the data and all the testimonies
indicate that shireen agua clay was
assassinated
and she was only killed by the israeli
army's bullet
we know the area very well what we know
is that only an israeli sniper can be
present there
but even after her death shirina boakley
is still a national hero for many this
poster says an icon of free speech many
palestinian journalists who attended the
ceremony here at san jose hospital say
it was she who inspired them to enter
the profession shirin abu ekley will be
laid to rest on friday musa vatios world
occupied east jerusalem
