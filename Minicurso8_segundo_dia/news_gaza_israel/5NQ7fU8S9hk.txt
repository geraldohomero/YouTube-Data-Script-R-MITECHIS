Now we are making arrangements there is a
Change or that I invite you to join for
rescue the Argentine states every
country asks for yours but it seems to me
What matters is that it is the family
Everyone's family of any man
Democrat of any man who
reject these perverse manifestations
of terrorism torture deaths
decapitations gives me to mention it
It seems to me that it is a limit of the
humanity
simply
solidarity with the hostages that were
arrested by a terrorist act of
never and ask for your release I am
here in the
Daia
supporting the fight against
terrorism
and asking for the release of the Renes is
fundamental end with the
murderous terrorism in the
world to make Israel
defended because the goal is
eliminate it once we talk about that
Well we can talk about what happens in the
Argentina is a tragedy for all not
only for people who are in
This ugly kidnapping situation but
for all humanity because if not
We respect the basic norms of
coexistence if there is good terrorism no
There is a way that no one can be
Quiet I think we are all today
full of sadness for what is
happening and clearly repudiate too
attempt of violence and fundamentally
What terrorism does in the world
We are doing here is asking for the
civilians who are
kidnapped and really is an act
humanitarian does not have any
political consequence or definition of
That guy is not true what is
asking is for the people who suffer in the
regi as a very
Tragic there are more than 20 citizens
Argentines who are
kidnapped by an organization
Terrorist I raised in the first debate
that if on December 10 I have the
responsibility to govern Argentina
We are going to include in the list of
terrorist organizations because
We are facing a terrorist event in
the moment that I am president and the
Decision depends on me I'm going to do it
