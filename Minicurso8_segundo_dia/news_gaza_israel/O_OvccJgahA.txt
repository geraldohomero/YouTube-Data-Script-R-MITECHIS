but are you condemning Hamas or not no
sure
not sure not Hamas is part of uh the
Palestinian people and I condemn the
occupation if there is no occupation
there is no
Hamas
come
any conflict or any bloody conflict is
very bad from the beginning but we have
I think to know why Hamas have
attack now if we look to the situation
we can't take it just two days ago we
should go back to years of uh
massacres committed by the Israelis
forces
and their uh settler armed
militias now from the beginning of this
year the Israelis have killed more than
one 260 people in Palestine in West Bank
no one talk about it no one condemn that
sir but don't you think that the ACT
committed by the Hamas is condemnable
because it uh it attacked civilians it
attacked they took hostage from lot of
people and uh as it say it's Act of War
how do you look at it what about the
Palestinian what about the Palestinian
the Palestinian those I'm talking about
from the beginning of this year 260
people have being killed they are
civilian secondly we have more than fif
5,000 in the Israeli jail we have about
300 people ad administrative uh
detention in Israel they make hunger
strike to release them they have nothing
the Israelis have nothing against just
put them in jail now anyone who want to
condemn what Hamas have
done uh he should before condemn what
the Israelis and their settlers doing in
West Bank that's fine but are you
condemning Hamas or not no sure not
sure not Hamas is part of uh the
Palestinian people and I condemn the
occupation if there is no occupation
there is no Hamas there is no fat there
is no any armed except the government uh
arm Israel Has Its milias Right and what
they are doing same what Hamas maybe the
operation of Hamas is a little bit
bigger right but no one condemn what the
daily settlers do those militias Israeli
militias in West
