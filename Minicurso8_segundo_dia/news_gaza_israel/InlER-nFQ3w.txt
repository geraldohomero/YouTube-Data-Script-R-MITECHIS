IN.
AND THAT'S WHERE WE BEGIN HERE
TODAY.
THESE NEW AIRSTRIKES AGAINST
HOUTHI TARGETS IN YEMEN CARRIED
OUT BY THE U.S. AND THE U.K.
NOW, U.S. OFFICIALS CONFIRM
THE STRIKES JUST A SHORT TIME, 
SAYING THAT OTHER COUNTRIES
ARE NOW PROVIDING SUPPORT. 
>> THIS, AGAIN, A MULTI
LATERAL OPERATION.
THIS IS SECOND ROUND OF STRIKES
CARRIED OUT BY THE U.S. AND THE
U.K. TARGETING THE REBEL GROUP.
>> THIS, OF COURSE, FOLLOWS
A SLEW OF ATTACKS FROM
THE HOUTHIS ON COMMERCIAL
SHIPPING VESSELS IN THE RED SEA
.
OUR ABC NEWS SENIOR PENTAGON
REPORTER LOUIE MARTINEZ
IS JOINING US NOW FOR MORE ON
THIS.
LOUIE, THANKS FOR BEING HERE
WITH US.
SO, FIRST OF ALL, WHAT MORE DO
WE KNOW ABOUT THE STRIKES
AT THIS HOUR?
AGAIN, IT'S A MULTILATERAL
OPERATION, MEANING OTHER
COUNTRIES ARE INVOLVED HERE.
>> SO WHAT LENGTH ARE THEY
INVOLVED?
YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT THIS
INVOLVES U.S. AIRCRAFT,
THE UNITED KINGDOM AIRCRAFT, 
TOMAHAWK LAUNCHED MISSILE
CRUISE MISSILES BEING LAUNCHED
FROM SURFACE SHIPS IN THE
RED SEA.
THIS IS WHAT IS BEING CALLED
A JOINT MULTILATERAL, JUST LIKE
THE FIRST NIGHT OF THAT
OPERATION BACK ABOUT TEN DAYS
AGO.
SINCE THEN, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
IS THE UNITED STATES CARRYING
OUT SMALL, PRECISE, PREEMPTIVE
ACTIONS AGAINST U.S. MISSILES
THAT WERE BEING PREPARED
AND READY FOR LAUNCH AGAINST
SOME OF THOSE COMMERCIAL
SHIPPING LANES IN THE RED SEA
AND THE GULF OF ADEN.
SO VERY SIGNIFICANT IN THE FACT
THAT IT IS ONCE AGAIN
A MULTILATERAL OPERATION
TARGETING THE WHO THESE
UNITED STATES HAS SAID ALL
ALONG THAT THIS IS NOT JUST
A U.S. PROBLEM, THIS IS AN
INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM.
AND SO THAT'S WHY WHAT WE SAW
MULTILATERAL OPERATION
ON THE FIRST NIGHT AND AGAIN,
WE'RE SEEING IT HERE.
OBVIOUSLY, HOUTHIS HAVE NOT
STOPPED WITH THESE ATTACKS.
AND SO THIS IS, AGAIN, 
THE UNITED STATES TRYING
TO LAUNCH, ALONG WITH ITS
ALLIES, A MORE BROAD KIND
OF RANGE OF STRIKES.
AND I THINK THAT'S THE KIND
OF INFORMATION WE'RE GOING
TO FIND OUT THAT THIS
IS INVOLVING MULTIPLE LOCATIONS
INSIDE YEMEN BEING USED BY THE
HOUTHIS TO TARGET THESE VESSELS
IN THE RED SEA AND THE GULF
OF ADEN.
>> AND YOU'RE REFERENCING THOSE
PAST THERE ON JANUARY 11TH
AND THE AFTERMATH.
PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYING THAT HE
THOUGHT WOULD SEND A CLEAR
MESSAGE THAT THE U.S.
AND PARTNERS WILL NOT TOLERATE
