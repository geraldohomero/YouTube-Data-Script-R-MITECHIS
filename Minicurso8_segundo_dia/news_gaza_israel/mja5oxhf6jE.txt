October A B C's Ryan and Alley has the latest
this morning. The world is now seeing Hirsh
Goldberg pollen alive more than 200 days after the American
Israeli citizen was taken hostage during the October 7th attack.
Speaking in Hebrew Hirsch's
hair is shaved and he's missing part of his left arm.
The 24 year old says I am the son of Jonathan and Rachel.
I was born in California and quote mom, Dad, Libby Orley. I love you
much. I miss you very much. I think of you every day that I'm here.
I need you to stay strong for me and not stop fighting.
It's unclear when Hamas recorded the video which Hirsch's
parents gave ABC news permission to show.
Hirsch
was seen at the music festival in Israel that came
under attack being pushed into this truck by Hamas terrorists.
His parents say Hirsch
was hiding in a shelter,
militants threw grenades inside,
severely wounding his arm just days after their son was taken captive last fall.
Hirsch's
mother said this to David Muir. We are
every person's nightmare.
That's who we are.
Anyone who's a parent,
anyone who
is a mother or has a mother can imagine what I'm going through. And now a
mix of both relief and worry seeing a video of Hirsch
today is overwhelming.
We're relieved to see him alive,
but we are also concerned about his health and well being.
The video of Hirsch
prompted protesters to take to the streets in Jerusalem last night
demanding the government do more to bring home the hostages.
About 130 are still believed to be held by Hamas
Hirsch.
If you can hear this,
we heard your voice today for the first time in 201 days and if you can hear us,
we love you
stay strong,
survive

Well,
talks for a potential hostage deal between Israel and Hamas appear to have stalled
but the White House says it remains focused on trying to bring them home.
