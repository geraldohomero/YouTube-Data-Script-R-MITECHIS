>> Dana: CROSS EXAMINATION IS 
THE WORD I COULDN'T THINK OF ALL
MORNING.
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME.
OVERNIGHT A BAY AREA CITY 
APPROVED A CONTROVERSIAL 
RESOLUTION ACCUSING ISRAEL OF 
ETHNIC CLEANSING.
CITY LEADERS SAY THE MOVE SHOWS 
SOLIDARITY WITH THE PALESTINIAN 
PEOPLE IN GAZA BUT AS YOU CAN 
IMAGINE SOME OF THE CITY'S 
JEWISH COMMUNITY SAYS IT IS 
ANTI-SEMITIC.
MARTHA MACCALLUM IS STANDING BY 
FOR ANALYSIS.
LET'S GO TO CHIEF NEWS 
CORRESPONDENT IN SAYS LITO, 
CALIFORNIA.
>> THIS ANTI-ISRAEL, PRO-GAZA 
RESOLUTION IS THE FIRST OF ITS 
KIND IN THE NATION AND TENSIONS 
RAN HIGH AHEAD OF THE VOTE.
>> ISRAEL CONDUCTING A FORM OF 
ETHIC CLEANSING AND COLLECTIVE 
PUNISHMENT.
A WAR CRIME.
>> IT APPEARS TO ME THE CITY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO WROTE THE 
RESOLUTION ARE USING THE TRUDGE 
SITUATION IN PALESTINIAN AND 
ISRAEL TO GAIN POLITICALLY FROM 
IT.
IT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME.
I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS 
RESOLUTION.
>> THINGS GOT HEATED AS SPARKS 
ON BOTH SIDES GAVE EMOTIONAL 
STATEMENT.
MANY -- SEVERAL JEWISH SPEAKERS 
SAID THEY NO LONGER FEEL SAFE IN
THEIR CITY.
RICHMOND'S VICE MAYOR SAID A 
MEDIA BLACKOUT WAS ONLY SHOWING 
ONE SIDE OF THE WAR AND THE CITY
COUNCIL HAD AN OBLIGATION TO 
SPEAK OUT.
>> UNTIL THE RIGHTS OF 
PALESTINIANS ARE ADDRESSED IN 
THIS CONFLICT, WE WILL SEE MORE 
HOSTILITIES.
>> THE RESOLUTION READS IN PART 
QUOTE THE CITY OF RICHMOND 
STANDS IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE OF GAZA 
CURRENTLY FACING A CAMPAIGN OF 
ETHNIC CLEANSING AND COLLECTIVE 
PUNISHMENT BY STATE OF ISRAEL.
IT GOES ON TO CALL THE GAZA 
STRIP THE WORLD'S LARGEST OPEN 
AIR PRISON AND ENDS BY DECLARING
THE CITY'S PROMISE TO COMBAT -- 
AFTER HEARING FROM MORE THAN 100
SPEAKERS IN PERSON AND ON ZOOM 
THE CITY COUNCIL PASSED THE 
RESOLUTION IN THE EARLY MORNING 
HOURS TODAY BY A VOTE OF 5-1.
AS ONE JEWISH LEADER TOLD ME, 
QUOTE, IT WAS A GOOD NIGHT FOR 
HAMAS, HE SAID.
HE WORRIES THAT OTHER LEFT 
LEANING CITIES L
