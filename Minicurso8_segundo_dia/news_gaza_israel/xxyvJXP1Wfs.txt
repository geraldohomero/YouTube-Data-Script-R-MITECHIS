I just imagine my young daughter in my
arms and the same thing I get emotional
talking about it right now dealing with
the IC I don't think being repromed for
wearing a black armband which the ICC
asked me on day two what it was for I
told it was for a personal

the reason I'm doing it is because it
hit me hard you know I I told Nick
literally just this morning that
when I'm looking at my Instagram and I'm
seeing kids innocent
kids videos of them dying passing away
that's what's hit me the hardest I just
imagine my young daughter in my arms and
the same thing I get emotional talking
about it right now again and that's the
reason I'm doing this I don't have any
hidden agendas if anything you know if
anything this brings up more negativity
towards me people come and start
attacking me I don't get anything out of
this I just feel like it's my
responsibility to speak up on this we
live in such a beautiful country I'm
blessed to be able to go to Australia I
can walk outside I don't have to worry
about a thing my kids can do the same I
just want that for the rest of the world
you know dealing with the IC I don't
think being reprimanded for wearing a
black armband which the ICC asked me on
day two what it was for I told it was
for a personal bement I never ever
stated it was for anything else shoes
were a different matter I'm happy to say
that but the armband made no sense to me
um I followed all the regulations the
past precedence from my point of view
that's all asked for the IC just
consistency I think there's been uh
plenty of people who've not had
permission to wear stuff in the past and
for me I was very clear and open about
the armband is what I'm getting
reprimanded for I was very open and
honest with that so I'll deal with that
with the ICC and I'll have those
conversations with them from what I've
seen from what I've done I've notice
that a lot of people have a lot of
agendas different sorts of
agendas I don't have any
agendas other than trying to shine a
light on what I feel really passionately
really strongly about I'm trying to do
in the most respectful way as
