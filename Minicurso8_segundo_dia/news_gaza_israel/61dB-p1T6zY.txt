united nations is actively engaging all
sides towards an immediate ceasefire

un security council in a virtual meeting

negotiations with the goal of a
two-state solution leaving two states
side by side in peace security and
mutual recognition which jerusalem is
the capital of both states
all based on relevant even resolutions
international law and prior agreements
palestinian foreign minister riad
al-malki told the high-level emergency
meeting that israel is killing
palestinians in gaza one family at a
time and committing war crimes
the international consensus you have all
helped shape and defend
is being destroyed in front of our very
eyes
the alternative that israel choose is
apartheid

apartheid
and one day soon
even this council will not be able to
deny this reality
but israeli ambassador to the u.s gilad
erdogan told council members that they
can choose to defend israel and
dismantle hamas in gaza
israel
has already made its choice
we will take all steps necessary to
defend our people
