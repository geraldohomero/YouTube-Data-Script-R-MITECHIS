people are dying we know that for sure
she must be saying every day is my daddy
where is my daddy why isn't he come to
save me I need my omry back I need my
men
back I went in to just for with one
single question to know if the all of
the war cabinets supports the same stand
that Gans and eizen Co took a couple of
days ago when theyve met with us when
they said absolutely clear without
hesitation that bringing out the
hostages is the top priority as far as
they're concerned and now when we've met
with the entire cabinet what we've heard
is that taking down Kamas and bringing
the hostages
are as important are equally
important it's a
nightmare an absolute nightmare we pray
that we get we get we get them back I
pray I'll get Emily
back that's my Prime Focus my reason for
living for getting up in the morning
every day cuz believe me I just want to
stay in bed and just just a quiet death
if you like just go to
sleep and forget it all but
no for Emily I have to get
up and do everything I can to get Emily
back and all the all the at least at
least the
children all the children and the babies
38 of them they're bloody
monsters
for
[Music]
it seems like everyone talking about the
the children's of course the women of
course but the men it's
okay we don't want to
wait we like five years or six years
until they come back
also and this is important to understand
that these people they are as Citizens
they are not as soldiers and then they
need to come back
also yes I know that this is what going
to happen when they took him uh I told
him four sentence I told him that I love
him I told him that
I got our
daughter that that I waiting for him
and I and I told him also don't be a
hero because I want you back here me I
need my omry back I need my man back and
Ronnie and Alma need him back so this is
my War
