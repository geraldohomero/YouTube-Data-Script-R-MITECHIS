National carrier at shalal airport in
the queue are French and Israeli duel
Nationals who booked last minute tickets
but were given travel priority they are
some of those who answered Israel's call
to sign up to fight in
Gaza French media accompanied them on
their journey to Tel Aviv and while
Israel has welcomed their participation
it doesn't have unanimous support back
home one parliamentarian wants French
national who joined the ranks of the
Israeli Army to be investigated and even
prosecuted I'm not here to prejudge or
slander any body but I am calling for an
