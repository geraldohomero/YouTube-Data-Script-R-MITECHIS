You must be thinking that I am in a college
I am not in any computer center
I am in a college, i am someone
I am in a computer center at this time
I am in Crisis Aid Center because Joe
October Sa was followed by this Crisis Ed
The center was built and all the people you see
Stay this is from the different field, there is a doctor
Some are architect, some are engineers
Studies in school but all these children
Girls here are watching walter
Are doing because on October 7 when Hamas
When he attacked his country, he felt
That they will have to be united together
Would have to fight the war where another people are Sard
But these are fighting the battle to help people
Try trying this time
There is a lot of psychological trauma
Many people are worried
There is an atmosphere of fear and whenever he
They get a phone call first
He attends the call
Go to place and help people
Let's try something with me at this time
People are trying to talk to them
Will do how you are dealing with
Psychological trauma that peepal hav gun thrue
Well the municipality is a lot of social
Welfare Division That is in charge of Dealing
With le de population that is in trauma vach is
The Hole City But De R Different Levels and
Rankings of Trauma of X We Hav
Posist we have social workers thate in touch
Vith all the population sins the kinag
Alderly and we have a very large scale off
Volunism
Looks like you can put it on or you
He can apply bandage or stitches
Can but psychological scars that
You have something to deal with them
Don't do you a little bit of love
Love is to take a little time and see
These small children who also in their homes
Could sit but they thought that today
The trouble that has come on their country
Help people
