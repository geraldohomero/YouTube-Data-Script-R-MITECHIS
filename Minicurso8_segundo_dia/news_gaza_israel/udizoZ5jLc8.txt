 
 UP TODAY, LOOKING AT 4.83%.
 BRIAN, DONALD TRUMP CALLING FOR
 TOUGHER IMMIGRATION 
 RESTRICTIONS, HE WANTS TO -- 
 THE TRAVEL BAN.
 A LOT OF PUSHBACK ON THOSE 
 COMMENTS?
 >> GOVERNOR DESANTIS SAID 
 SOMETHING SIMILAR.
 THEY SHOULDN'T COME HERE.
 HE SAYS THEY HAVE THIS 
 ANTI-SEMITIC APPROACH TO 
 THINGS, WE CAN'T TAKE THE RISK.
 THIS IS A VERSION OF WHAT 
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID THE 
 WAR ON TERROR IS RAGING AND 
 SEEMS TO BE KICKING BACK INTO 
 GEAR, ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE 
 SOUTHERN BORDER, HE LOOKS AT 
 SANCTUARY CITIES, THAT'S A 
 LITTLE OVER-THE-TOP, NOW HOW 
 DOES THAT LOOK.
 THEY SUTRA SANCTUARY STATUS, 
 NOW THE SANCTUARY STATUS THING 
 IS GOING WELL FOR US.
 WHAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO IS 
 SAY CAN WE GET CONTROL OF 
 IMMIGRATION LAWS AND LOOK OUT 
 FOR PEOPLE HERE AND THE HORROR 
 OUTSIDE THE GAZA LINE.
 THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF EXTREMISTS
 ARE CAPABLE OF, LET'S LOOK AT 
 THIS.
 THE WAY HE DID THE TRAVEL BAN 
 WAS TERRIBLE, HE SAID IT AND 
 ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHAT IS GOING 
 ON?
 HOPEFULLY HE KNOWS HOW TO 
 IMPLEMENT THINGS BETTER NOW IF 
 HE BECOMES PRESIDENT AGAIN.
 STUART: TWO WEEKS INTO OCTOBER,
 WE HAVE 16,000 KNOWN GOT AWAYS,
 FOUR IRANI AND SCOTT AT THE 
 BORDER.
 IF THERE IS A TERRORIST 
 INCIDENT LINKED TO THE BORDER, 
 POLITICALLY PRESIDENT BIDEN IS 
 TOAST.
 >> HE SHOULD BE.
 WHAT HE HAS DONE AT THE BORDER 
 IS WORSE THAN ANY POLICY I 
 REMEMBER OUTSIDE AFGHANISTAN.
 IT SHOULD DESTROY THE CANDIDACY
 OF ANY PARTY.
 THAT'S WHY THE MAYOR OF NEW 
 YORK CITY IS DIVORCING HIMSELF 
 FROM IT.
 THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK IS 
 RUNNING FROM IT.
 THE GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS IS 
 RUNNING TO THE HILLS AND YOU 
 WON'T SEE ANYBODY IN 
 PENNSYLVANIA DOING ANYTHING 
 DIFFERENT.
 PEOPLE SAY GOVERNOR DESANTIS IN
 FLORIDA HAS CRACKED DOWN 
 EFFECTIVELY.
 IN OKLAHOMA THEY HAD DON'T HAVE
 THESE ISSUES, THAT TO ME IS THE
 PROOF WHAT POLICY IS EFFECTIVE.
 60 MINUTES DID IMMIGRATION 
 STORY.
 YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID ON?
 HOW DARE YOU LOWER PEOPLE TO 
 MARTHA'S VINEYARD 18 MONTHS 
 AGO.
 WHAT WAS REALLY BEHIND THAT.
 THAT'S THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE 
 PEOPLE CARE ABOUT?
 RICH PEOPLE FORCED TO DEAL WITH
 39 PEOPLE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY,
 A PRIVATE JET RIDE TO A 
 LUXURIOUS ISLAND VACATION?
 THAT SHOWS HOW WARPED PEOP
