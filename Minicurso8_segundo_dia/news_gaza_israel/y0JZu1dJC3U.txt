It is a failure of the United States to the UN and
This meeting was the occasion for a
new pass of weapons in particular between
Washington and Moscow the Russian Ambassador
accusing the Americans of hypocrisy
with this text they who refused to three
recoveries any resolution calling for a
stop the fire so far and then
The American ambassador denounced the
cynicism she says of the Russians who refuse
obstinately to vote a text written by
the United States, however, this resolution
marked a turning point in the
United States policy vis-Ã -vis
of Israel and reveal how Joe Biden
is itself under pressure pressure from
the international community that accuses
basically the United States of complicity
in the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and then
internal pressure Joe Biden is in
full campaign for his re -election to
White House and in his own camp
Democrat He is more and more
criticized for its position in this
conflict in particular by voters
Muslim Americans who no longer want
vote for him disappointed with his position
in this conflict then the Americans
will continue their efforts on the
field to try to negotiate a
stop fire with Israel but we have it
heard Benjamin Netanahou wants
Continue your offensive project
terrestrial on Rafa anyway for
United States is indeed blocked at
US Congress here in New York at
The UN sorry and does it mean
that no text calling for a cessation
fire in Gaza cannot be
adopted then there are several others
texts currently circulating at
UN a text written by the 10 members
elected officials of the Security Council therefore in
outside the permanent members of this
advice this text which calls
to an end to pardon will be presented
Tomorrow in the vote and then France has
Announced he is Emmanuel Macron who
said prepare a text in this direction
also the French president hopes
Go around the Russian and Chinese veau
with the help of mediation of some
Arab countries so the next hours
will be important here in New York
