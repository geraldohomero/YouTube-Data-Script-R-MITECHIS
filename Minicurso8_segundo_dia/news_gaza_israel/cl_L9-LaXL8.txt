Well, we are now live to Israel
so there is being carried out
vigil yes with candles this in memory of
The victims after this attack
perpetrated by ever on October 7
We are talking about 14 people who
They lost their lives after these attacks and
At this time images that are taken to
now there in this important
Source leaves candles this in commemoration
and in memory of those people
those innocent who lost their lives
In this disagreement of both nations
In this way then we see how
This vigil is carrying out if for
assumption well Andr√©s said and we come
speaking throughout the program were
More than 100 people among them children
adult women assumed of all
ages were brutally
Thus we talk about more than 200 hostages in
This moment that nobody knows that it is from
His life if it's really alive
but the
situation is a war
that left more than 11,000 dead and like
We always say nice 11,000 dead
as a provisional sum without taking
in account that every 10 minutes I have
I stayed with that phrase and I don't want to do it
an apology but what hurts and
It is necessary to share it yes every 10
minutes a child dies here for
logic at the time we are not
We share that type of material but in
Social networks the material
shared of what is being taken to
out there in the enclave is impressive
Children crying because they have lost
their parents the parents crying because
They have lost their children families
destroyed do not live are surviving
and escaping every second second with a
uncertainty that can more than
life expectancy itself is a bit
The panorama of what happens in Gaza
But also showing what happens in
Israel because although the bombings are
terrible gauze and happen to each
instant are also happening in
Israel only that there the
information does not arrive but the sirens
They constantly sound only
also the iron dome that
intercept for several of them but they are
having more victims are injured
Also in Israel day by day and there we see
Family to friends commemorating
With this vigil of course
victims in a little while we are going to
