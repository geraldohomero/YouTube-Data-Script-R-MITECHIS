We are facing the wisdom of a war and
Second war has started assume
That not a state vs state not a
Action is being taken against militant group
But the kind of action is happening
The way Israel's Defense Minister is called
Rahi no food no water no electricity no
Fuel VR Dealing with the
Animals This is a dangerous message and saying
Whether we will change the map of Gaza or middle
East will change the map of that area and someone
Even a statement from a big country
It is not that we also talk to Palki
Saw which is trying to stop it
Gurjit ji, if you have gone recently or
If you are experienced, tell us that
What is going on this
Time is tired of me, the experience of this area
Is that I came from the same week
Was in Palestine in Jordan
And there was no one expected that
There will be a war there, the battle in Tail Aviv
That was a mutual battle, Netanyahu's government and
Opposition Supreme Court's Judicial Reform
Roads were fighting over
All the police were getting protested in it
Nobody focused on such war
Was not when I went to Jerusalem and Bethleham
Bethleham is inside Palestine
There was an outrage in me in Tail Aviv
People do not understand in Al Aksa Mas
The problem that is Jerusalem and Bethleham
I have expressed their good today, what you say
We have been treating them like animals
Those people were telling me that
We are being treated like animals
Is
So at this time I understand that four things have happened
Israeli government deep divided blunt it's
I of the
Ball second he ever Palestine National
No partnership with authority so
Hamas keeps dominating him third
His intelligence failure that he is up of Hamas
All the attention was not paying attention
The bank and the Palestine were placed over and
Four they understood that we are up to Saudi Arabia
Will make friendship and someone inside us
There will be no reaction four
Miskalculation is seen here
Rahi ji
