GAZA BY ISRAEL.
MATT BRADLEY HAS OUR REPORTS
TONIGHT FROM TEL AVIV.
>> Reporter: TONIGHT A REFUGE
WAITS FOR WAR.
ISRAEL HAS SAID IT'S ABOUT TO
TURN ITS GUNS ON RAFAH, A CITY
IN THE SOUTHERN GAZA STRIP WHERE
PREVIOUSLY MANY IN GAZA HAD BEEN
TOLD TO FLOWEE FOR SAFETY.
>> YOU SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE
A SAFE PLACE.
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU LIE ABOUT
THIS PLACE IS BEING SAFE AND
THEN TURNING BACK AND BOMBING
US?
>> Reporter: NOW AMONG MORE THAN
A MILLION HERE, FEAR IS
SPREADING ALONG WITH STARVATION
AND DISEASE.
>> WE'VE BEEN HEARING THAT THEY
WANT TO COME TO RAFAH, JUST LIKE
EVERY CITY IN GAZA.
AND WE ARE SO SCARED, WE DON'T
KNOW WHERE TO GO.
>> Reporter: ISRAELI PRIME
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU
ORDERED HIS MILITARY TO PREPARE
A PLAN TO EVACUATE CIVILIANS
HERE AND DESTROY WHAT'S LEFT OF
HAMAS, CALLING RAFAH A LAST
BASTION FOR THE TERRORIST GROUP.
>> RAFAH IS JUST TWO STREETS.
IF THEY BOMB ONE OF THEM,
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILL DIE,
AND WE MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM.

A PREVIEW OF WHAT MIGHT AWAIT
HERE, DOZENS ALREADY KILLED.
THE U.N. SOUNDING THE ALARM.

ABOUT THE FATE OF CIVILIANS IN
RAFAH.
IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR US
TO PROTECT THEM FROM TANK FIRE,
FROM ARTILLERY SHELLS.

BIDEN VOICED RARE DISAGREEMENT
OVER ISRAEL'S ATTACKS ON GAZA.
