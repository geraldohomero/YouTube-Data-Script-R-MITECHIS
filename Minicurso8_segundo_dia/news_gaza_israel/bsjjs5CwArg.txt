Israel Hamas War recently
I felt that Israeli inside the gaz
The army is constantly weakening there
Hamas on the other hand is the Israeli army with full force
Was responding to and with which the goal
She entered the Israeli army gaz
The goal was not seen to be fulfilled, yes
Despite causing heavy havoc in the gaz
Israeli army is not eliminated from Hamas
Humas has been able to do upside down with full force
Israeli is attacking the army but
In the midst of all this, the Israeli army has made one such
Action has been taken which caused the whole of Hamas
Actually the head of Hamas's political bureau
Ismail harm
The capital is living in Doha but their
The family was in the gaz and now Israeli
Defense Force made an aerial attack
Three sons and three ships are killed
Hania's three sons in IDF case
Hajan Aamir Mohammed and his grandson Amal Khalid
And Rajan has been killed by media reports
According to Hania's three sons Western Gaza
In a car from Refugee Camp Alshita
Riding on the occasion of Eid, their relatives
We were going to meet but then on them
IDF launched an aerial attack in which these
Everyone has died while on the other hand
Hamas chief Ismail Hani Yeh Ko his
If the news of the death of sons was found very much
Got emotional and he said that this pain
And with blood we our objectives and
Expect future for your nation and
I create freedom
The sons martyrs gave the biggest honor and
My son Gaza has achieved respectable death
With the sons of our people in the bandage
Stay and he did not leave Gaza and go to Gaza Strip
In all our people and each family
Palestinian with the blood of your children
He has paid heavy price for conflict and I
I am one of them about 60 relatives
Martyrdom and others

Palestinism
Our connectivity towards more strong
Hanaye further said that enemies
Murders of demolition and massacre
He has failed to meet the goal
Achieve this goal from the conversation also
We will not be able to free Aluku and Alksha
Neither stagger your way to get it done
And neither behind
[music]
Hania will also make it clear that
Hamas will not surrender to Israel
Because the country that surrenders
We are not able to achieve peace
Will compromise nor give up its defeat
Whatever we do
[music]
Lying
