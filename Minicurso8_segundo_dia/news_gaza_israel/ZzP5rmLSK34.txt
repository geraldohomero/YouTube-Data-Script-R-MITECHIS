This is the fact that since the start of the
war we attended attacks
systematic against the structures of
Health uh and that too is unheard of
At msf there in wars
health structures are always
slightly sensitive areas and there is
always incidents but there is not
Incidents are attacks
systematic which makes us say that
This is the health system in its
set that was clearly targeted by
Military operations so it's not
Just a hospital here a hospital there
It is the entire health system uh
which has been systematically targeted
All the big hospitals and here
There was this little girl who
is called Myriam who was 6 years old and who
was therefore who had the all one
part of the face that was burned which is
in his little hospital who does not move
of the day because there is no
TV there is no phone there is not
network there are very few there are very
Little distraction uh which has been amputated
the right leg of the right leg and to which we
had to change the dressing
So uh so it's changes of
dressing which is very painful it
must remove the dressing and this
Little little girl she yelled during
A 30 minutes to make the dressing
And after 30 minutes she called
Her mom she was exhausted actually
She called her mom who was killed
in the bombing uh his brother was
killed his little sister in the bombing
was killed in the bombardment and his
father we didn't know where he was so you
have a little girl who is all
alone in the hospital that screams to death
of pain and and with anyone for
there
Consoleration therefore the first of all
Requests are the CC the immediate fire
and supported because right now what
is happening it is a
massacre as I said myself when
I was in Nasser I stayed a
Night there is an air strike at
150 m from the hospital it killed people
including two children of 4 and 5 years of
little boys aged 4 and 5 and it has
80 people injured also a lot
children I saw the next day
besides a seriously injured child
who was vomiting blood
When we have when we visited what then
The le le Il is a massacre that takes place
Currently really uh
