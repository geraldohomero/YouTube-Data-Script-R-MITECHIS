>> THEY WILL BE BROUGHT TO
JUSTICE.
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT.
THIS IS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WHICH
IS AIMED AT WEAKENING THE
COUNTRY.
THIS WAS A COLOSSAL THREAT FROM
OUTSIDE.
HOWEVER, THE ORGANIZERS OF THIS
REBELLION HAVE BETRAYED THOSE
PEOPLE WHO WERE DRAGGED INTO
THIS ORGANIZATION.
AND THIS KIND OF SUICIDE IS
PRECISELY WHAT THE NEO-NAZIS IN
KYIV AND THE WEST WANTED.
THEY WANTED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS TO
KILL EACH OTHER.
SERVICEMEN AND CIVILIANS BEING
KILLED.
AND IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS THAT
RUSSIA SHOULD FAIL.
AND THEY WANTED OUR SOCIETY TO
BE FRAGMENTED, TO BE SPLINTERED.
AND THEY TRIED TO TAKE REVENGE
FOR THEIR FAILURE AT THE FRONT
BUT THEY SLIPPED UP.
THEY MADE A MISTAKE.
ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO THESE
SPECIAL SERVICES WHICH HAVE
MAINTAINED THEIR OATH TO THE
COUNTRY.
THEIR COURAGE AND SELF-SACRIFICE
HAVE SAVED RUSSIA.
AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE
WAGNER COMPANY ARE ALSO OF
RUSSIA.
THEY HAVE DEFENDED DONBAS AND
YET WERE ENCOURAGED TO FIGHT
AGAINST THEIR COMPATRIOTS AND BY
TURNING BACK THEY AVOIDED
FURTHER BLOODSHED.
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DECIDED TO
DO THIS STEP.
WHICH WOULD HAVE HAD TRAGIC AND
DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR THE
COUNTRY, FOR RUSSIA AS A WHOLE.
I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK THOSE
COMMANDERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE
WAGNER PRIVATE COMPANY WHO TOOK
THE RIGHT DECISION TO STOP AND
GO BACK AND PREVENT BLOODSHED.
AND I URGE EVERYBODY TO MAKE
CONTACT WITH THE MINISTRY OF
DEFENCE.
OR GO BACK TO THEIR HOMES.
THIS PROMISE WILL BE FULFILLED.
I REPEAT, IT IS THE CHOICE OF
EACH OF YOU THAT IT WILL BE A
CHOICE OF THE WARRIORS OF RUSSIA
WHO HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR
FAULT.
IT IS THE PATRIOTIC DUTY OF
EVERYONE, THE PATRIOTIC FEELING
OF EVERYONE THAT HAS SAVED
