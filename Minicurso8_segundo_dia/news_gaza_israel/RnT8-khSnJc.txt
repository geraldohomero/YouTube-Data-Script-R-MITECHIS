We are going to show you in images the
situation that is being lived
Really desperate of hospitals
In Gaza Strip we had already told you
Well there is no light so they have to
be with flashlights in some cases
They are lucky to have flashlights
others with cell phones and sio
with torches really extremely
worrying the medical teams of the
Gaza Strip City Hospital
they worked with patients under the light of
torches this last Friday like this
showed this video of the staff inside
from the hospital attending
In complete darkness apart from some
torches that were supported by
Some of the people even
accompanied and hay
heartbreaking shout of some of the
relatives of the people who
directly die inside the hospital
because there is no way to operate them
save them good the red crescent
Palestine said Friday that a
person died and another 28 resulted
wounds in a shooting perpetrated by
Israeli forces at Hospital rent in
Gaza most of the injured were
children and two are in state
critic as a result of the fire of
snipers targetly directed to
Hospital according to this statement from the
Red Crescent The situation is
Trist√≠sima moving This is what I know
is living in hospitals in the
ABSOLUTE DARKNESS GASA GASA
of inputs lack of light lack of
FTA of personnel to attend and the worst
Of all, in some cases when
They can do some intervention
surgical have to do it without
anesthesia in some cases those that
They are lucky with a little sedation
Imagine not the situation
Tremendous that these people are seeing
added to the moment as we saw just from
Family members who approach this
place and receive the news that nothing
It could be done and that their beings
