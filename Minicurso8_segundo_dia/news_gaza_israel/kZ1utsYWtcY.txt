Situation right now of hospitals
In good field the situation is critical
Most of our teams are
currently working in two hospitals
and two clinics in southern Gaza eh and
The needs are really massive is
very difficult to priorit what is needed
Because everything is really needed
eh the number of patients have been
enormously increased in front of
What we received before October
eh and to this is added the fact that
Many times people are in the
Hospitals also to take refuge
because they have no other place to go

Tools tell what type of
people are there in these
hospitals with many
difficulties we have no part of
of our Palestinian EH teams that
They decided to stay many times to
Great risk in northern Gaza and
others who continued working in the south
