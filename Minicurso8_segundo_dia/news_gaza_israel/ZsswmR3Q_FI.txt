we came for a sit down that will last
from today until uh end of day Wednesday
3 Days To Block H the knesset the
Israeli Parliament this is the last week
of the parliament session because before
they go on Haas or vacation ER yes
during time of war and when we still
have 134
hostages still in Gaza we came to call
on them on the on this government to
resign this is a government that has
failed us repeatedly from last year that
when they tried to pass H the judicial
overall on October 7th when so many
people have died and they couldn't help
us and from October 8th and on they're
still neglecting us they passed an
outrageous budget that has nothing to do
with the fact that we're still at War
and there's so many people who are still
displaced
[Music]
[Applause]
this really shows that the Israeli
public woke up which is clear today 6
months after the massacre of October 7th
that in order to win we need you new
leadership in order to bring back the
hostages we need new leadership is is
cannot allow itself the continuation of
netanyahu's government and its Coalition
we need to go to new
elections it's all people in Israel
that will
prime minister and move and make some of
them
want election now H I want
my
father-in-law home now so
what which way it doesn't matter just
bring them
