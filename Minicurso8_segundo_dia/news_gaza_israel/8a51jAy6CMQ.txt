nick you have new numbers on canadian
spots about the state of the canada u.s
relationship what are they telling you
well you know there there are some key
divergences and and uh
key commonalities you know the
interesting thing is that when we ask
canadians who the greatest health threat
is to canada the united states is at the
top of the list
when we ask americans in a new study
that we just released with the state
university of new york
who the greatest health threat is it's
not canadians it's china
so there's a complete divergence on that
which is why there's such a strong
appetite in canada to close the border
but where canadian and american
views converge relate to china itself
where now uh you know canadians and
americans both identify
visitors from china as priorities for
being asked for id for example
and uh so we're kind of united by a
common fear of the chinese or concern
and anxiety related to the chinese
but divided on this pandemic because
people in canada see what's happening in
the united states
and they have significant concerns about
the risks to canadians because of the
pandemic
right and then we saw again this week
that the canada us border is likely
going to be
shut down for at least another month and
if this continues probably a couple more
to come and it seems that way canadians
are still okay with it i know there are
challenges and complications but
i am curious to see how the perspective
evolves
between canada and the us and the
feelings canadians have over the next
couple months as
we get through the presidential race and
find out the results
uh also of course we should note that
this week the americans backed off of
their tariffs of canadian aluminum
at the 11th hour basically right before
canada was going to slap retaliatory
tariffs on them
uh so you know the relationship there
complicated bit of an exchange of words
continues we'll keep that file
on our radars for sure
you
