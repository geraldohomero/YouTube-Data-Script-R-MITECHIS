Welcome to Route 749. This road is coming out
Right here from Oz creek all the way west into
The Gaza Strip is almost up
The sea A wide road that will remain the strip
Gaza and the city will be given no longer the Gaza Strip but rather
A leash from here and Gaza
This way Dozens of tractors and trucks and tools
Engineering is operated by reserve forces
The Engineering Corps opened stone factories here. They're shredding
The stones and the sheets are prepared for the width axis
The new jobs as you can see don't stop
For a moment we are in a corridor Netzarim
That creates a buffer between the northern Gaza Strip area that is located
To the north of us and the central and southern regions
Which is south of us to protect Space to simplify
To spaces where an enemy is present to prevent the crossing
From the south to the north and to control it very much
Meadow
We're on our way From the east, this route is ready
As you can see, it will soon be partially eliminated
West is close to the beach
Gaza behind us from the east A stream of Oz ahead of us from the west
Here is the sea I see the sea in a moment's sight
We're going now for what's to come
The road to everything has a temporary number
A road
749 in all the axis length on the right from the front or
Not in the back We saw one whole house. It seemed like a brain
The buildings are bent, perhaps even saluting
The forces that pass
There is no doubt that you are here to stay Prolonged
For a very long time, such an axis is not paved
For only two months, we've been breaking through all the roads
All the fighting forces allow us to break through Paths
To the waiting forces
And at the end of our ability to come with the means of sabotage
Our various and destroy the terrorist infrastructures that exist
On the ground and certainly Also in the subterranean
Different parts of this territory will be paved for the western part of
The corridor of the houses you see here will soon disappear
The grounds It will all become a desert
