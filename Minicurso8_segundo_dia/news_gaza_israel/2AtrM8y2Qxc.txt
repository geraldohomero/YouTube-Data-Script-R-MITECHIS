a hamas compound was hit today by
israeli bombs
and gaza's national production bank was
blown up new setbacks for hamas
militarily
but the attacks are also devastating for
the people of gaza
buildings turn to rubble and dozens
killed including children
many families have sought refuge in this
u.n relief agency school
artillery was hitting from every side
she said she had to bring her children
to safety
hamas too has demonstrated firepower
israeli officials say the militants have
already fired more than 1800 rockets
in sterot near the border this building
was struck
my home was hit says this woman 20 years
after the first rocket
the kids are being damaged for life
both sides have the advantage and
disadvantage of proximity
israel has multiple air bases locations
in gaza can be attacked within
minutes but hamas rockets while less
accurate can target border towns like
sterot with little warning
and they can reach heavily populated
areas including tel aviv and beyond
then there is israel's ground forces
they can build up on the border with
gaza quickly
not far from sterot israeli tanks and
troops have been gathering for days
already destroying hamas tunnels their
presence an ominous sign that an all-out
war is looming
prime minister benjamin netanyahu said
again today that hamas will pay a heavy
price
his political future is at stake an
opposition party has been asked to form
a government
a decisive outcome militarily could help
netanyahu politically
but there is instability elsewhere in
israel unrest in jerusalem
and mobs of jewish and arab israelis are
fighting each other in several cities
it's all putting pressure on the
international community to intervene
quickly
the u.n security council meets on sunday
the only way
that it's going to resolve is through
negotiations
there would need to be
willingness on both sides to step back
but at the moment no one is stepping
