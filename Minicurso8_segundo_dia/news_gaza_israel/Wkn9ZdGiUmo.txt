a tenth day in the occupied is jerusalem
the day started with a record number of
right-wing religious jewish groups
reaching al-aqsa compound to pray in
defiance of a long-standing ban
palestinian worshipers were there to
defend the holy site
and they were matched with stun grenades
and rubber bullets despite warnings from
palestinian factions the israeli
government gave the green light for the
march to go ahead through the muslim
quarter of jerusalem's old city
today we will mark jerusalem day during
the day various events will take place
including the traditional flag parade
that will take place on its regular
route waving the israeli flag in the
capital of israel should go without
saying so we were clear on the matter
from the first moment i ask the
participants of the parade to celebrate
responsibly and respectfully
in the afternoon it was an even bigger
challenge
thousands of mostly young ultra
nationalist jews gathered at the
damascus gate waving the israeli flag to
celebrate what they say is israeli
sovereignty over jerusalem yet according
to international law this place has been
under israeli occupation since 1967
i came to be happy with jerusalem 55
years ago jerusalem was united and we're
just happy here
me i came with some friends with my
school and we came to dance um for
jerusalem
um i know um
my neighbors um
aren't so happy that we're here but we
didn't come to annoy them we came to be
happy for jerusalem
we live here they live here we're gonna
dance around jerusalem and try not to
make any of our neighbors angry
inside the city palestinians were there
to stand up to the parade but as
expected they were heavily confronted by
israeli police palestinian red crescent
say more than 60 people were injured in
the confrontations
this year's flag march ended without a
major confrontation but this procession
poses an annual threat as israeli
right-wing jews will continue to demand
the right to pray inside al-aqsa mosque
in what is considered to be a stock
provocation by palestinians
world occupies jerusalem
