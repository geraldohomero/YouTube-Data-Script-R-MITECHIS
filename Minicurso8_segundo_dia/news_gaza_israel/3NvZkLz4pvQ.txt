meanwhile cases of the omicron variant
are on the decline worldwide but there
is a stealth variant that is officially
being classified as ba 0.2
that seems to be graining traction
and the state of israel has reported the
very first cases of this strain combined
with omicron as well as the stealth
variant
according to the israeli health ministry
at least about two people
are said to be infected with this new
strain
a strain that has combined the original
omicron and the stealth ba2 variant the
ministry has said that this train has
not been seen
anywhere else in the world yet
the ministry also noted that the cases
were found amongst international
travelers have been arriving in recent
days at the ben gurion airport the
ministry said that the two cases are
suffering from mild symptoms and not
shown the need for any kind of special
medical care so far
now from the first of march the state of
israel began allowing entry to all
tourists regardless of the cover 19
vaccination status
overall testing has fallen across the
state of israel but all international
arrivals are checked upon landing in the
airport
the development comes as ba2 is
beginning to replace the original
obikrant strain in many countries after
an initial case of omicron
ba2 has been documented to have
reinfected some people
the world health organization does not
consider ba2 to be a distinct variant of
concern
but is continuing to monitor its spread
research on its severity is mixed
however vaccines appear just as
effective against it
there are also reports of israel having
detected cases of new covert variant
this is a hybrid of the delta the and
the omicron
in recent weeks the rate of transmission
has also ticked upward in the state of
israel and health officials are very
concerned
that the new wave of virus could in fact
be on its way as israel is marking its
jewish festival of purim
