This is the first time Hamas and its
leader have said that they are close to
an agreement with Israel.
These are not direct talks are being
mediated via Qatar, and it seems as if
there's a good chance we get a large
group of of hostages that are being held
by Hamas in Gaza released in the coming
days.
I should note that these talks could
definitely still break down and we still
haven't heard a response from the
Israeli government to Hamas's latest
proposals.
We're not exactly sure what the latest
as a sort of
negotiating negotiation point was from
Hamas.
But broadly speaking, it seems as if
we'll get a group of about 50 or maybe
even 100 hostages released, probably
mainly women and children.
And in return, Israel will agree to some
kind of partial truce, maybe limited for
a few hours a day and not to all of
Gaza, but to parts of it.
And also it would probably agree to
release some Palestinians held in
Israeli jails.
So what would the deal mean for cease
fire in Gaza?
Again, that's a big question.
Israel has been very consistent that it
doesn't want to accept a ceasefire yet.
It thinks that would just play into
Hamas's hands and allow the militant
group to
to to regroup and to regain some of its
strength.
So it seems as if fighting would still
be going on, even if there were truces
each day for for a short amount of time.
And even if they included
and a sort of a limited pause in Israeli
airstrikes over parts of the territory.
But as far as Israel is concerned and as
far as Israel is saying publicly, this
war is continuing until Hamas is is
destroyed.
And that's not going to change even if a
large group of hostages is released from
from Gaza.
