This biggest news on Israel war
The attack will not stop air ground due to the air ground
Israel will continue the release of every hostage
Efforts are on for efforts for Israel
If you continue, say this from Israel
It has been given that this attack due to hostages
Will not stop in hundreds
Hamas held Israeli citizens hostage
One is kept until Israeli is not kept
Will be rescued until the release is
Till then efforts will go from Israel
Ongoing
Will stay and see Manish from Israel's Barry
Connect with us once again
Manish has gone, what has been said
It seems from Israel that he
The vow is not a hostage until that one is a hostage
This is the attacks that are left till then
The destruction is that he walks
Will see us to see compassion
Need to understand, especially when I
I am moving towards Gaza Strip that Israel
What is the government thinking about this war now
And so when I have top level
He spoke to the government source
That the Israeli government has decided that it
Under no circumstances
Blackmail will not come in and that hostage
Will not stop your operation in the name of
This means that the government of Israel or
Israel's army will try to try as hostage
They are all brought home safely
Family members should be introduced but
There will be no blackmailing i.e. if hostage
Even if it could not be brought for any reason
Operation will run because Israel's government
The aim is Hamas's government of Israel
The aim is to protect Israel and not
Israel completed in the name of only 100 and a quarter mortgage
Make the country hostage and think this
Hard this you say with strong action
If Israel's army and air force attack
If it has been, it means that she
Not going under pressure and until we
Exactly this attack does not take the name of stopping
The one and so in such a situation
To end is also taking a pledge
Thank you very much
