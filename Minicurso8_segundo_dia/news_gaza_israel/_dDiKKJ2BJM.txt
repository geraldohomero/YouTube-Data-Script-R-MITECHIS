hello Nam Namaste good uh evening over
there India thank you for talking to
us uh we woke up at 6:30 in the morning
as you said from a lot a lot of
rockets and we are used to rockets and
whoever lives near the border has a
shelter in their house so lucky for me I
had a shelter in my house
that's uh what's going on we thought
it's like a rocket attack every few
months Hamas shoots rockets on Israel
they don't care on who women children
old people every time but every time we
go inside the shelter and we thought
it's a regular bombing morning but this
time it wasn't only bombing they came
with terrorists into the K booots while
I was locked in the shelter I didn't
know what's going on I just heard
shooting and shooting and I had Kamas
people walking around my
house
around my uh in my garden I heard them
and it was very very scary very crazy
very brutal whoever they saw they just
killed them raped them brutally murdered
them burned them alive all over the area
there were kib that were
destroyed
uh Till There the ashes and this is a
Islam
radical we have to deal with for the
last uh since Israel became Israel you
know so this is pretty much what we have
here brutal attacks from Hamas that
declar Jihad on us I'm sure you guys in
India also have that with Pakistan and
all extreme Islam that also want to kill
with no reason just for being in their
religion and this is very scary as you
know it was like from a scary movie and
AR kibuts we managed to kill all the
terrorists people civilians who had
their own guns but the kibuts near me
they did be that far AA they did kill
their almost most of the kibuts and
burned alive
families and the shelter didn't help
them and they just came and just killed
us for being Jewish and this is SC this
is crazy this is a War
crime and it's not every day I see
outside of my window soldiers going
running after terrorists that's uh crazy
as well and we hope the world can see
the crimes against humanity that was
taking place here there were many
soldiers on the way to come and save us
and they were also brutally M murdered
by this
Hamas sudden
attack and uh so it's not that
there that people they didn't even know
how big situation it was for like 1,500
terrorists coming just to shoot and kill
whoever is Jewish and doesn't believe in
the same Islam God of their
theirs
