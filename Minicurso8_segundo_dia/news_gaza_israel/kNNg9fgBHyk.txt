we now come to the SNP motion on Gaza I
understand that the second motion on the
order paper will not be moved
today this is a highly sensitive subject
on which feelings are running high in
the house in the nation and throughout
the world I think it's important on this
occasion that the house is able to
consider the Wiest possible range of
options I have therefore decided to
select amendments both in the name of
the Prime Minister and in the name of
the leader of the
[Applause]
opposition if the official opposition
amendment is not agreed to I will call
the minister to move the government
Amendment formally that will engage
the order I'm going to
fin that will engage the provisions of
standing order number 31 one so the next
vote will be on the original words in
the SNP motion if that is not agree to
sh then the house will have the
opportunity to vote on the government
Amendment proceeding this way will allow
a vote to take place
potentially on all proposals from each
of the three main parties but I take
your advice because obviously I've taken
advice from the clerks this is the snp's
opposition
day and the purpose of an opposition day
is for our party to have the ability to
put forward our business we've already
had a significant delay to the start of
this motion which has significant
interest to the extent we dropped our
second motion and now we're completely
appear to be doing things in a way
that's never been done before can I ask
for your advice Mr Speaker and what is
the point of an opposition day if it's
going to be done like
this yeah
yeah and can I just say I think you will
want to vote at some point trapping
isn't going to assist
it a point of order has been raised by
the S SMP Chief with as I say I've made
a judgment on the precedent that's been
done before I have view it I have viewed
it as that is my ruling and I'm going to
stand by the ruling and I'm not take any
more P towards
[Applause]
