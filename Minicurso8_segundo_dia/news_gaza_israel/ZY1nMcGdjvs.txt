Hello Cécile Washington received
assurance that there would therefore not be
military operation in these areas
during the duration of this break
Yes toren because it is obviously the
the pressure of the Americans who weighed
to make these posseuses
humanitarian workers have set up
On Israel then how they organized
Well they will last 4 hours every
days it's everyday only in
North areas, eh you said it
to allow civilian to descend
to the south they will be warned eh
ask we ask for the Americans 3h
Advance surely with leaflets like
often do it the Israelis Israel
talks about tactical break and not to stop
The fire a fire will be possible
only he benyamin neaniiaou has it
repeated with the release of all
Hostages Joe Biden The American President
He is congratulated a step in the right one
direction he said but he stays
still a lot to do to protect
civilians are still he needed to
Recall an exodus exodus an exodus
population
important and then at the same time
Benjamin Netanou on Fox News yesterday a
clarified the situation on the future of
Gaza strip he said we are not looking
not to occupy it but to demilitarize
deradicate and rebuild how
Well, that's the whole question Israel
said the troops progress
Israeli say they are progressing well
Around Gaza City 50 fighters from
Hamas would have been killed yesterday and during
this time the humanitarian situation and
health are critical to
Gaza
Yes because we are on the 35th day of
war and Israel constantly bombard
All the northern districts are in
ruin lack of water lacks food
Lack of medical help and medication
obviously the Minister of Health you
said it spoke more than 10800
dead including 4,412 children there are no more
Place HE now in cemeteries
And we no longer know how to bury
bodies some remain in
Decomposition for several days
In the streets hospitals are
obviously saturated a lot insefits uh
Many flies south it is the
majority some still refuse
to descend they tell us that the south
is not as sure as in the
Gaza band No place is safe and
then there are these irreducibles who
tell us we will stay in the north
Because we prefer to die worthy with us
