the tranquility of a park in Montreal here the
war could no longer be
distant yet for Dalia Dana and
Rania this war seems closer
That never sometimes I'm even afraid when
My phone rings I'm afraid they
will tell me that your family died
Dalia is 29 years old her parents fled Gaza
before his birth but his uncles his
aunts her cousins ​​live there
still since the request of the army
Israeli to evacuate the north of
The enclave members of his family have
left their Rimal district in Gaza
from Avi in ​​anxiety I have cousins
cousins ​​will be a week
Since October 13 that I have no
contact with others I don't know in
fact if they are survivors or s are
dead I know
not the only cousin with whom she succeeds
still to communicate is Mohamad and
his two inf
is near the Hospitalif Moham a
Open AI AC Facebook for its
children and that's ACC had them
said if ever who will die that his
children must contact me so a
way to prepare for the worst as if the
Worse was
inevitable so he gave me the message
He told me if I am not yet yet
alive but you will take either from my
children then you tell them that their daddy
loves them with the death toll that does not
cease to grow and the spectrum
of a terrestrial escape that still hovers
nothing reassures them I stop
think about the situation I wish as
It's honestly it's really
Difficult to see all the suffering
then see everything that is going on there
Dana was born here but she too has
family there in the background which is
discouraging it's silence
of many people
the life of the Palestinians wants less than
that of the Israelis punishment
collective what is its
to make towards the people it pleads
For a Saess fire and the implementation
of a humanitarian corridor all the more
that Dalia has already worked as
volunteer with children in Gaza Elle
knows the needs too well for these
women mobilize is the only way
to face their helplessness
that they call the guilt of
Survivor I am lost
s you know how I have no right to
Live I have no right to be happy
I have no right to drink water
because the others they don't all have
The means to
survive a part of me would like it
be helping
They have the will to return there
is like connected to this earth
there but when and in what condition
She ignores it
Again
