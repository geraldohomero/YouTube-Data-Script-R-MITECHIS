N
OTWA TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
AS MANY AS 100 CHILDREN MAY HAVE
DROWNED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
AFTER THE MIGRANT BOAT CARRYING
THEM SANK OFF THE COAST OF
GREECE.
THE COUNTRY HAS DECLARED THREE
DAYS OF MOURNING.
AS CTV'S JOHN VENNAVALLY-RAO
REPORTS, HOPE OF FINDING
SURVIVORS IS FADING.
>> Reporter: NEW VIDEO SHOWS
SOME OF THE MALE SURVIVORS BEING
LIFTED OFF A RESCUE BOAT AS THE
FRANTIC SEARCH CONTINUES FOR THE
MANY MISSING WHO HAD BEEN ON
THIS SHOCKINGLY OVERCROWDED
VESSEL INCLUDING WOMEN AND
CHILDREN.
AT A GREEK PORT, THIS SYRIAN MAN
WAS LOOKING FOR HIS WIFE WHO HAD
BEEN TRYING TO JOIN HIM IN
EUROPE.
HE SAID
SHE PAID ABOUT $6,000 CANADIAN
TO SMUGGLERS TO GET ON THE BOAT.
AT LEAST NINE PEOPLE ARE UNDER
ARREST TONIGHT ACCUSED OF HUMAN
TRAFFICKING.
THE BOAT HAD LEFT LIBYA ON ITS
WAY TO ITALY WEDNESDAY WHEN IT
CAPSIZED AND SANK OFF GREECE.
SURVIVORS ESTIMATE THERE WERE AS
MANY AS 750 PEOPLE ON BOARD AND
BETWEEN 40 AND A HUNDRED
CHILDREN KEPT IN THE HOLD AND
IT'S FEARED THEY MAY HAVE
DROWNED.
>> YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT
SORT OF DESPERATION A FAMILY
MUST BE IN TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN
IN THE HOLD OF A BOAT THEY FEAR
MAY OR MAY NOT MAKE IT ACROSS
THE WATER.
IT'S QUITE A TRAGIC SITUATION.
>> Reporter: SO FAR, AT LEAST
78 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED
DEAD AND NO ADDITIONAL BODIES
WERE FOUND TODAY.
ABOUT 100 SURVIVORS, ALL MEN
FROM COUNTRIES LIKE PAKISTAN,
SYRIA AND EGYPT, ARE WORRIED
ABOUT THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
WHO WERE BELOW DECK.
>> ALMOST EVERYONE HAD FAMILY.
SOME TALKED ABOUT HAVING KIDS.
HAVING A KID.
DOESN'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.
>> Reporter: GREECE'S
COASTGUARD REFUTING CLAIMS IT
KNEW IT WAS IN TROUBLE BEFORE
SENDING HELP.
IN WATERS CONSIDERED TO BE THE
MOST DANGEROUS MIGRANT CROSSING
IN THE WORLD.
THE U.N.  SAYS SINCE 2014 MORE
THAN 20,000 DEATHS HAVE BEEN
RECORDED ON THE ROUTE.
GREECE DECLARED THREE DAYS OF
MOURNING AND THE TRAGEDY A
HORRIFIC REMINDER OF HOW MANY
MAKE SUCH PERILOUS JOURNEYS.
THE U.N. SAID THIS WEEK ONE IN
74
PEOPLE ON EARTH WERE FORCIBLY
DISPLACED LAST YEAR.
THIS AS MORE CALLS FOR THE
EUROPEAN UNION TO CHANGE ITS
MIGRATION POLICY WITH ONE CRI
