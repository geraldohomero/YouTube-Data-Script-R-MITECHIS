people for your incredible support for
Israel in our war against The Barbarians
of
Kamas I thank you in English

a
Mr
secretary your visit is another tangible
example of America's unequivocal support
for
Israel Hamas has shown itself to be an
enemy of
civilization the massacring of young
people in an outdoor Music
Festival the butchering of entire
families the the murder of parents in
front of their children and the murder
of children in front of their
parents the burning of people
alive the
beheadings the
kidnappings of a young
boy not only
kidnapped molested hurt
attacked and the sickening display
of celebrating these Horrors the
celebration and glorification of
evil President Biden was absolutely
correct in calling this sheer
evil Kamas is
Isis and just as Isis was crushed so too
will Hamas be
crushed and Kamas should be treated
exactly the way Isis was treated
they should be spit out from the
community of
Nations no leader should meet them no
country should Harbor them and those
that do should be
sanctioned Tony my
friend I say to you I say to all of us
there will be many difficult days
ahead but I have no doubt that the
forces of civilization will
win and the reason that's true is
because we understand what is the first
prerequisite of Victory it's what you
just said in our meeting moral
Clarity this is a time a particular time
a special time that we must stand tall
proud and United against evil Tony you
are taking that stand America is taking
that
stand thank you for being here
