How is the mood gift new then very flat
Look at the mood, it is flat because the weekend
I seemed like this, on Friday, it looks like this
It was that this war could be very escalate
That's why people left their positions
Banks results are very good in US
Come war can be very escalat
This means that what is Israel is different
Which is his Lebanese Syria is Mishra
He can be engaged with everyone yes in war
But nothing like this had happened, there was such a fear
And it is limited only to Gaja
People had gone lightening their positions
While Friday got very good results
There is Pay City Bank Wales Fago of Banks
JP Morgan despite great results
Market did not run while stocks of those banks
When people were walking, people
Left was the fear that something had to come
Or something was telling the bank nothing came
No, they are right but despite that
If the rates have increased a lot, Nims is very much
He is tremendous, he is ahead
Outlook is very good now if the bank
This meaning is giving good outlook ahead
Understand that the rate interest grows
You are doing so that there is no growth
This is why the results of banks are good
So I am saying because their
Profit is increasing what happens in the rest of the country
What is the difference that makes crude
So ran away because probably was afraid slate
Will see the crude is cool now
That 90 a little down to her 20 30 sets down
This situation has come there but
This situation is a change in the last 48 hours
If it is not there, then you see the market
Gift Nifty or Eve US Futures
You see the flat there
There is no big movement but fear
It is about that because very fast in Gaja
There are still attacks and fear that
Do not go to the market in that fear
Another wise is seen giving reaction
Big thing, you see gold also 35 at a time
But if you have gone up, people went towards safe haven
Now see how much it sustains
Everything is on this, if that groom
Market normalize if not kocalate
It will be done by the time you both are over
He went straight to Harshda's Sif Stocks
The show was to end with me, I was thinking
Toss straight there
