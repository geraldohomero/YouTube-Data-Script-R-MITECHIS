There is a lot of pressure on Israel At home and outside stop
The war before we achieve all of its goals
At the cost of a deal at any cost to release
We are very kidnapped They want to get more
Release we're ready for the roof to go as a roadway
We're not willing to pay any price, let alone you
The prices The crazy things that Hamas demands of us
Defeat the state
[Music]
Israel is committed to continuing the war
That we will achieve all of its goals Means the elimination of the violence
The release of all the abductees and the promise that Gaza will not be established
It is more a threat to Israel and there is no pressure
That can Change up

This one
I am now going out of a conversation with students
The settlement in their spirit that buried nine in this war
Adults and Truth I was shocked to see that when I was
In here, there are people who use abductees to do it
I was asked what was more important
And I did That I don't think we should bring back competition
We need to beat the Homs we need
Bring back the kidnapped and the way to bring back
The kidnappers She beat Hamas and run on it
I'm saying that from today

Sle I think dynamic strikes or
Coalition strikes absolutely have an
Impact but we at no point said That
We're wiping all of their capabilities
Off the map we know they have a large
Inventory large warehouse to
Use

Hth Controlled areas in Yemen in the red
sea initial indications are that it was
Shot down by ath sur to Air missile in
