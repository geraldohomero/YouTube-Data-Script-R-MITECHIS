six israeli police officers have been
injured in a car ramming in occupied
east jerusalem
the attack happened in sheikh jarrah
that's the neighborhood where israeli
settlers are trying
to expel forcibly four palestinian
families who live there
the driver was shot dead harry fawcett
has more from sheikh jarrah
in occupation jerusalem the border
security forces checkpoint that has been
placed here
at the entrance to the road which has
been the scene of so many of the
protests and so much of the tension here
in occupied east jerusalem throughout
the month of ramadan
a car approached it it seemed to do so
at speed we've had
uh witnesses two of them at least
telling us that the driver
appeared to shout allahu akbar got as
great as he
approached uh the checkpoint and it
rammed
uh drove straight into where the police
were six
of those officers were injured uh the
police spokesman says four of them
likely two of them moderately but it was
a very violent impact
and it looked to be potentially quite
serious to say the least
to the to the well-being of those uh
police officers
as for the driver himself he was shot
dead
in the moments after the attack or at
least the moments after the
impact shakhtar has been as i say the
center of
a long simmering protest which has
really
gathered pace in the last few weeks
particularly on the basis
about four families who faced the
imminent threat
of forced removal from their homes it
was part of the
wider picture of tension throughout
jerusalem which exploded
on that last monday and now we have the
the violence which has been
erupting throughout the area and on this
day this afternoon that violence
also felt very keenly here
