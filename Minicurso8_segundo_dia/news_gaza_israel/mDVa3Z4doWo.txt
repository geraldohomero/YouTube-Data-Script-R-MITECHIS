Israeli forces battling Hamas said 
they had uncovered an unusually large  
concrete and iron-girded tunnel at 
the Gaza-Israel border, designed to  
transport carloads of militant fighters.
Chief Israeli military spokesperson Rear  
Admiral Daniel Hagari said the tunnel 
was 4 kilometres, or 2.5 miles long,  
stretching from Gaza City - once the heart of 
Hamas governance and now a devastated combat  
zone – to the Erez crossing at the Israeli border.
Without demolishing the tunnel project of Hamas,  
we cannot demolish Hamas.
Razing or disabling hundreds of  
kilometres of underground passages and bunkers 
is among the aims of the Israeli offensive. 
The military showed reporters the exit 
point of the tunnel, located just 100  
metres south of the checkpoint at Erez.
The Erez crossing is one of the sites  
Hamas overran on October 7, killing 1200 
Israelis and taking 240 others hostage. 
Hagari said it was the biggest tunnel 
Israeli forces have found near the border,  
without specifying whether it was used 
by Hamas for the October 7 attack. 
Generally the tunnels shown to the media by 
the group, or by the Israeli military after  
their discovery, have been narrow and low - 
designed for single-file movement of gunmen  
on foot. The tunnel shown by Hagari had 
shafts plunging vertically downward that,  
he said, suggested it was part of a wider network. 
Hamas did not respond to a Reuters request 
for comment on the Israeli account. 
Since the October 7th attack, Israel has besieged 
Gaza and laid much of the Palestinian enclave to  
waste. Around 19,000 Palestinians have been 
killed, according to Gaza health officials,  
with thousands more suspected buried 
in the rubble of Israeli air strikes.
