FOR FREEING HER AND THAT'S
LIKELY WHY SHE WAS THE FIRST
AMERICAN UNDER THIS CURRENT
AGREEMENT.
>> HEARS THE PRESIDENT.
>> SAFE, IN EGYPT.
SHE HAS CROSSED THE BORDER.
I TALKED WITH HER MOTHER AND
FATHER WHO WERE VERY
APPRECIATIVE AND THINGS ARE
MOVING WELL.
SHE WILL BE HOME WITH HER THREE
CHILDREN.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER
AMERICANS?
>> THAT SHORT REMARK FROM
PRESIDENT BIDEN AS HE'S WALKING
UP ON THE SPEAKING LIVE.
HE'S IN COLORADO, NOW ASCENDING
THE STEPS OF AIR FORCE ONE
AFTER SPEECH THERE EARLIER
TODAY, CONFIRMING THE NEWS, THE
RELEASE OF AMERICAN HOSTAGE.
SHE IS NOW SAFELY IN EGYPT.
THE PRESIDENT, CLEARLY
RELIEVED, BUT NOTING THERE IS
MORE WORK TO BE DONE.
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE TO BE
FREED. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
YOU ALLUDED TO, YOU SUGGESTED
MAY HAPPEN, AND THAT IS WHAT WE
ARE SEEING PLAY OUT NOW, LIVE.
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS NOTABLE
THAT HE SPOKE TO SOME FAMILY
MEMBERS. IT'S SOMETHING WE SAW
ON SUNDAY WITH ABIGAIL'S FAMILY.
THIS IS SOMETHING, AGAIN, FOR
THE PRESIDENT, I AM TOLD, HAS
WANTED UPDATES AT EVERY
POSSIBLE INTERVAL.
HE'S WANTED TO KNOW THE LATEST
IS TRAVELING ON A TOTALLY
UNRELATED MANNER AND WANTS TO
HAVE THOSE CLOSE TO HIM LET HIM
KNOW WHAT THE LATEST IS SO WE
CAN CONTINUE TO BE IN TOUCH
WITH THE FAMILIES.
WE KNOW THAT THROUGHOUT THIS
PROCESS, FAMILY MEMBERS OF
OTHER AMERICANS WERE
UNACCOUNTED FOR AND WE BELIEVE
ARE BEING HELD BY HAMAS. WE'VE
BEEN IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE LIKE
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JAKE
SULLIVAN, AND OTHER KEY BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS IN THE
STATE DEPARTMENT TO KEEP
GETTING THOSE REGULAR UPDATES.
WHEN WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT
AND HIS TOP AIDES INITIALLY
SPOKE WITH THOSE FAMILY MEMBER
, ABOUT 10 OR SO OF THOSE
UNACCOUNTED FOR AMERICANS AND
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS A FEW
WEEKS BACK, WE WERE TOLD BY
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM IT WAS ONE
OF THE MOST GUT WRENCHING
CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD EVER
WITNESSED IN THEIR TIME AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE
ANGUISH, THE AGONY, AND THE
PAIN THAT SO MANY OF THOSE
FAMILIES ARE STILL
