asera fears her children are
gone she looks on as Rescuers do their
best to search through what remains of a
seven-story building obliterated in an
Israeli air
strike as explosion sound in the
distance clutching her children's
possessions she asked for help finding
them under the
rubble let me see them whether alive or
dead if dead bury them and if alive
bring them here the Palestinian defense
unit says at least five people were
killed in this Israeli attack but it's
hard to know just how many people are

concrete this Survivor says his family
was in the basement of a building in
Gaza City when it was bombed four of
them his mother two brothers and
sister dozens of Palestinians are killed
by the day in Israeli strikes many too
young to have understood the conflict
they were born into there continue to be
warnings that many more will die if
Israel launches its planned ground
offensive in Rafa my greatest fear is
what may come for Rafa and whilst
driving up through Gaza into Gaza City I
think what what I what I took away from
that was the looks in the eyes of the
people people which the emotion is truly
Indescribable everyone we passed
everyone we spoke to was
gaunt fril emaciated hungry that
everybody was doing this for
food in Rafa people are desperate to get
one meal a
day but it's not enough especially for
children there are a lot of patients in
the camp with all children suffering
from malnutrition and the widespread
presence of hepatitis
A while in Northern Gaza the situation
is catastrophic one in three children
under the age of 2 years old is
malnourished and hundreds of thousands
of people are facing
famine for the first time in months 13
humanitarian Aid trucks have arrived in
Northern Gaza but need is
overwhelming starving people resort to
picking through the sand for a few
grains of rice and legumes from what's
left of a ship of Aid that had spilled
into the sea they can only hope more Aid
reaches them before it's too late Rand
