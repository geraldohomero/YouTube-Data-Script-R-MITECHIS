OF WHAT IS NEEDED AFTER 13 DAYS
OF COMPLETE SIEGE.
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S BRING IN NBC NEWS CHIEF
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT RICHARD
ENGEL, LIVE FROM NORTHERN ISRAEL
NEAR THE LEBANESE BORDER.
RICHARD, YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE
LATEST ON THE POTENTIAL GROUND
INVASION.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?
>> Reporter: SO, FIRST, LET ME
SET THE SCENE WHERE I AM.
YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT THOSE
ISRAELI STRIKES AGAINST
HEZBOLLAH.
WE ARE IN THE TOWN RIGHT ON THE
LEBANESE BORDER.
THE HILLS BEHIND ME, ON THE BACK
SIDE OF THEM, THAT'S LEBANON.
THAT TERRITORY RIGHT BEHIND
THESE HILLS IS WHERE HEZBOLLAH
HAS ITS FIGHTERS, IT HAS ROCKET
POSITIONS.
IF A WAR WERE TO EXPAND, THAT
SECOND FRONT THAT BLINKEN WAS
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT, ISRAEL IS
CONCERNED ABOUT, THAT THE UNITED
STATES IS CONCERNED ABOUT, IT'D
COME POTENTIALLY FROM THIS AREA
WITH ROCKETS AND/OR FIGHTERS
COMING OVER THESE HILLS AND THEN
DOWN INTO ISRAEL.
THE BIG NEWS HERE THIS MORNING,
A LOT OF TALK ON ISRAELI MEDIA,
THE TELEVISION AND LEADING
NEWSPAPERS, THAT THE GROUND
OFFENSIVE MAY BE DELAYED FOR AN
INDETERMINATE PERIOD OF TIME,
AFTER THE UNITED STATES WAS, NOT
PRESSURING ISRAEL, BUT
ENCOURAGING ISRAEL TO SLOW
THINGS DOWN, TO GIVE IT A BEAT.
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME
MOVEMENT WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS
VIA QATAR TO FREE HOUSESTAGESHOS
AS YOU'LL REMEMBER,
AMERICAN-ISRAELI HOSTAGES WERE
FREED ON SATURDAY.
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME
PROGRESS.
TO ALLOW MILITARY BUILDUP IN THE
AREA, TO HARDEN AMERICAN
DEFENSES IN CASE THERE IS AN
ESCALATION, IN CASE THERE IS A
WAR WITH HEZBOLLAH, A WAR WITH
IRAN, AND TO SEE IF DIPLOMACY
CAN HAVE SOME SORT OF IMPACT TO
DE-ESCALATE THIS CRISIS.
OVER THE WEEKEND, THERE WAS A
SUMMIT IN CAIRO.
A LOT OF PIECES ARE IN MOTION.
ISRAEL IS STILL CARRYING OUT ITS
AIR STRIKES.
IT ALSO CARRIED OUT A GROUND
COMMANDO RAID NEAR THE BORDER.
THE MILITARY ACTIVITY IS NOT
SLOWING DOWN.
IN FACT, LAST NIGHT WAS THE MOST
INTENSE NIGHT OF AIR STRIKES
ACCORDING TO PEOPLE IN GAZA THAT
THEY HAVE SEEN SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF THIS CONFLICT TO
DATE.
THE AIR STRIKES ARE MORE INTENSE
THAN EVER.
ISRAELI TROOPS ARE GOING IN IN
LIMITED FORAYS, BUT ACCORDING TO
REPORTS THAT ARE ALL OVER THE
MEDIA HERE, THE GROUND OFFENSIVE
MAY BE DELAYED.
