the fbi and the northport police
department and our state and local law
enforcement partners have been searching
the area of the carlton reserve
for brian laundry
a person of interest in the murder of
gabby petitto
earlier today investigators found what
appears to be human remains
along with personal items such as a
backpack
and notebook belonging to brian laundry
these items were found in an area that
up until recently have been underwater
our evidence response team is on scene
using all available forensic resources
to process the area
it's likely the team will be on scene
for several days
i know you have a lot of questions but
we don't have all the answers yet
we are working diligently to get those
answers for you
we are grateful for the dedication and
professionalism of the northport police
department along with our partners from
the state and local agencies
complex investigations such as this
cannot be accomplished by what agency
alone
but there's just too many agencies to
name them all here today
portions of the miakahachi creek
environment park
and carlton reserve
remain closed to the public until
further notice
this is an active and ongoing
investigation
so we asked the public to maintain
distance for many law enforcement
personnel
equipment
vehicles and other related activity
for the safety of the public
and to protect the integrity of our work
we have no additional comment related to
today's activities
our fbi denver office is the lead
investigative agency and all future
inquiries should be directed to them
we appreciate the tremendous support
from the public
and continue to ask for your assistance
in bringing this investigation
to close
