So the perspective the forecast
The fall what has left
bewildered to much of the
International Community on Biden this
Tweet around the
eh of taxation to the rich this
It happened in the last
hours in the middle of the war of
Israel someone launched punctuated the
keyboard when I shouldn't have touched it or
directly be in a parallel world
But they drill yesterday putting on top of the
table that is capitalist would have to
question it if you can win 1000
millions of dollars if you can win go to
Look for them we don't know who speaks if
It is for someone from the family only pays
a little more in taxes but what
What pain this tweet in the middle of the
Start of war in Israel is time for
that billionaires pay a
minimum 25% tax
We are at war lacked
We are at war instead of coma
We are at war and with that I would have
approached but without the coma we are in
War this is a surplus of biden or
Who makes the networks
social this does not seem that it is
scheduled that we are going to get it in
Sunday already but are at war in
Israel between call and called in the tan
Yahu the fundamental key yesterday of
biden was the tax on the rich to
What to finance him
budgetary or why because
This twet as I tell you is missing
Coma we are at war is your money is
Our country supports we would have
understood all but this
capitalist what does what you were
that you are what you will be. I am the same
capitalist if you can win 1000
Millions of dollars go looking for them but
Who is talking about a relative
or of the average or of Unidense
medium so out of place
completely this biden tweet in the
yesterday's day in which he continues in his
world amid Twit and calls to
Netan Yahu now we are going to talk about the
multimillionaires look at the twit
Netan Yahu
