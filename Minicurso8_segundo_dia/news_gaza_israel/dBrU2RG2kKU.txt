DANIELE WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL 
US. 
>> Reporter: THE WESTERN CITY OF
LVIV WAS CONSIDERED A RELATIVELY
SAFE PLACE, AND IT WAS UNTOUCHED
UNTIL THIS MORNING WHEN FIVE 
MISSILES STRUCK WHAT LOCAL 
OFFICIALS SAY WERE FORMALLY 
MILITARY WAREHOUSES.
THEY'RE NOT USUALLY KEEN ON 
SAYING SPECIFICALLY WHAT HAS 
BEEN HIT, BUT THEY DO SAY THAT A
GARAGE, A TIRE PLANT, WAS ALSO 
HIT.
IN ALL, SEVEN PEOPLE WERE 
KILLED, 11 PEOPLE WERE INJURED, 
INCLUDING A CHILD.
THESE ARE THE FIRST FATALITIES 
IN THE WESTERN CITY OF LVIV.
IT ALL HAPPENED CLOSE TO THE 
TRAIN STATION.
AND WHY THAT IS RELEVANT IS 
BECAUSE ALL THOSE REFUGEES THAT 
YOU'VE SEEN COMING FROM THE 
EASTERN PARTS OF UKRAINE AND 
GONE OFF TO POLAND BY TRAIN, 
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO GO 
THROUGH THE CENTRAL STATION IN 
LVIV.
NOW, THERE ARE NO CASUALTIES 
REPORTED THERE, BUT IT HAPPENED 
VERY CLOSE TO THE TRAIN STATION.
I'M HERE IN KYIV OUTSIDE THE 
CENTRAL POST OFFICE.
THIS IS NOT A SCENE THAT YOU 
WOULD SEE EVERY DAY, BUT THERE 
ARE CURRENTLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
LINED UP OUTSIDE THE POST 
OFFICE, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET
THEIR HAND ON A STAMP.
A VERY FAMOUS STAMP THAT MANY 
PEOPLE WILL BE TELLING ON eBAY 
FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
DOLLARS.
YOU'LL RECALL A FEW DAYS AGO 
THAT THE FLAGSHIP OF THE NAVAL 
FLEET, THE RUSSIAN NAVAL FLEET 
IN THE BLACK SEA, THE MOSKVA WAS
HIT IN THE BLACK SEA.
IT SUNK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE 
WATER.
IT'S THAT SAME SHIP THAT ORDERED
UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS TO SURRENDER 
IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS AND THEY 
SURRENDERED TO THE COMMANDER, 
"RUSSIA GO [ Bleep ]", NOW IT'S 
ON A STAMP, OFFICIALLY GIVING A 
MIDDLE FINGER TO THE MOSKVA.
NOW THEY'RE WAITING UP TO SIX, 
EIGHT HOURS TO GET THEIR HANDS 
ON THAT STAMP.
IT'S A SYMBOL OF DEFIANCE OF THE
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE, A PIECE OF
