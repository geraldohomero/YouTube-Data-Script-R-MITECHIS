>> WELCOME BACK.
>> WELCOME BACK.
ISRAEL IS RELEASING MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT AN IDEA OF
SOLDIER KILLED INSIDE OF GAZA.
I WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO
JERUSALEM WHERE WE FIND NBC
NEWS CORRESPONDENT JAY GRAY.
THIS IS JUST BREAKING AS I AM
COMING ON THE AIR ABOUT 35
MINUTES OR SO AGO.
WHAT MORE DETAILS ARE WE
LEARNING ABOUT THIS?
IS THIS THE FIRST IDEA OF
SOLDIER TO HAVE BEEN KILLED
INSIDE GAZA?
>> WELL, TO THIS POINT, IT'S
THE FIRST WE HAVE BEEN TOLD
ABOUT IT.
WE KNOW THAT THE SOLDIER WAS
KILLED IN A RAID NEAR THE
BORDER THAT THREE OTHER IDF
SOLDIERS WERE INJURED.
ONE OF THOSE IS CONSIDERED
SERIOUS.
THE OTHER TWO WERE CALLED LIGHT
INJURIES.
WE KNOW THAT THERE CONTINUES TO
BE ACTIVITY IN AND AROUND THE
BORDER FENCE AND GAZA.
WE KNOW THAT THE TROOPS AND
EQUIPMENT THERE HAVE BEEN MOVED
AROUND.
IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY ARE
PREPARING TO DO SOMETHING ON
THE GROUND.
IN FACT, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
A WHILE, YOU HAVE ACTUALLY GOT
THE IDF TALKING ABOUT GROUND
MANEUVERS.
THEY HAVE INCREASED AIRSTRIKES
IN THE REGION, TARGETING
INFRASTRUCTURE OF HAMAS AS WELL
AS OPERATIONAL COMPLEXES.
THEY SAY THEY ARE DOING THAT IN
PREPARATION FOR, AND THESE ARE
THEIR WORDS, PRO-MANEUVERS.
WE KNOW THAT THE AIRSTRIKES
CONTINUE AROUND THE CLOCK.
THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE DOING
THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAMAS IS
WEAKENED, TIRED, AND DISTORTED.
THEY WANT TO DO THIS IN
PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT STAGE
OF MILITARY OPERATIONS.
YOU REALIZE THAT THINGS ARE
CHANGING ON THE GROUND BECAUSE
THEY ARE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT
THE GROUND MANEUVERS MORE
OPENLY.
AS YOU HAVE ALLUDED TO AND
TALKED ABOUT, THEY ARE WORKING
IN THAT AREA TO CLEAR THE WAY
FOR THOSE GROUND MANEUVERS.
ALL OF THAT FILTERING OUT AND
INTO AREAS LIKE JERUSALEM WHERE
EVERYONE IS WATCHING THIS VERY
CLOSELY.
THERE IS AN UNEASY TENSION
HERE.
WE TALKED WITH ONE OF THE
SHOPKEEPERS IN THE OLD CITY
TODAY.
HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
HOPING FOR A QUICK RESOLUTION.
>> THE ONLY THING IS TO FIND A
SOLUTION FOR EVERYBODY TO LIVE
IN PEACE.
FEED THE PERSON, HELP HIM, TAKE
CARE OF HIM.
HE WILL BE FRIENDLY.
WE WILL HAVE PEACE EVERYWHERE
ALL OVER THE WORLD.
KILLING, SHOOTING DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE.
HE DOESN'T MAKE ANY SOLUTION.
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT, THERE IS
SOMETHING ELSE.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE SHARE THAT
SAME SENTIMENT.
I THINK IT BEARS REPEATING.
