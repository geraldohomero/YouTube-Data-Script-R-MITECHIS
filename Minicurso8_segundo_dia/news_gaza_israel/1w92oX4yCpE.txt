SPEAKING AHEAD OF THE LIBERAL
CABINET MEETING.
LET'S LISTEN.
>> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau: 
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AND
HAVING THIS KIND OF MILITARY
CONFLICT IS HAVING A HUGE IMPACT
ON CIVILIANS.
CANADA IS ENGAGED WITH OUR
ALLIES.
WE HAVE ASSETS IN THE REGION.
WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING DIRECT
AIR LIFTS OF CANADIANS AND
DEPENDENTS.
WE'RE ALSO ENGAGED
DIPLOMATICALLY, I JUST SPOKE
WITH THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE
AFRICAN UNION THIS MORNING TO
CONTINUE TO OFFER ANY SUPPORT
CANADA CAN HAVE IN CALLING FOR A
CEASEFIRE AND LOOKING FOR A
RESOLUTION, IF THE SITUATION
CONTINUES (INAUDIBLE).
>> THERE'S DELAY, IT'S AN
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SITUATION,
WE'VE HAD RESOURCES IN THE
REGION FOR MANY DAYS NOW.
WE'RE COORDINATING WITH OUR
ALLIES.
THERE'S VERY LIMITED, BOTH
PLACES WHERE THOSE AIR LIFTS CAN
HAPPEN FROM.
THERE'S DISCUSSIONS AROUND --
WITH THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ON
WHO GETS TO LAND WHEN, WHO GETS
TO DO THE AIRLIFT WORK QUICKLY.
WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE COUPLE OF
SHIPS OFF THE COAST OF ON THE
RED SEA IN PORT SUDAN, A FRIGATE
AND A SUPPLY SHIP.
CANADA'S VERY MUCH ENGAGED, WE
WILL CONTINUE TO BE.
(INAUDIBLE).
[ Speaking French ]
>> Voice of Interpreter: THE
UNION IS ASKING FOR THE
RESIGNATION OF THE TREASURY
BOARD PRESIDENT.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR LEVEL OF
PATIENCE?
>> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau: WE
UNDERSTAND THAT NEGOTIATIONS CAN
BECOME TENSE FROM TIME TO TIME
BUT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE.
THE UNION AND NEGOTIATIONS ARE
STILL AT THE TABLE.
AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO
RESOLVE CERTAIN ISSUES AND THERE
ARE OTHER ISSUES STILL PENDING
BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE
IMPORTANT WORK OF REACHING
SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE AGREES
ON, BECAUSE CANADIANS DESERVE
THE SERVICES.
>>> DURING NEGOTIATING PERIODS,
PEOPLE WILL SAY CERTAIN THINGS
TO PUT -- MAKE PROGRESS.
BUT WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO THE
WORK THAT IS REQUIRED.
(INAUDIBLE).
>> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau:
YES, IT'S A VERY GOOD THING.
IT'S GREAT TO CONTINUE WORKING
WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN.
HE'S DONE GREAT THINGS FOR
CANADA-U.S. RELATIONS AND FOR
THE WORLD.
I WILL BE THERE TO SUPPORT HIM
FOR YEARS TO COME.
[ End of Interpretation ]
OBVIOUSLY I THINK IT'S GREAT
NEWS THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS
CONFIRMED HE'S GOING TO
CONTINUE.
THIS IS -- HE'S A LEADER THAT IS
NEEDED, NOT JUST BY THE UNITED
STATES BUT BY THE WOR
