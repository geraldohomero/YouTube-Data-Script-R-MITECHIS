this is the IM of the mosque he's
killed this is my brother he was also
killed in this
war this is my art and this is my house
it is now raised to the
ground this is how Ahmed shahin
remembers Ramadan last
year SP there's Ramadan family gathers
we drink coffee eat cake
the pediatrician from Gaza arrived in
Saro 3 months ago with his wife
daughters and six
son this is the first time since my age
of 30 and onwards I have spent Ramadan
without being in Gaza with my family I
cannot understand this month is coming
and we are not in
Gaza memories of Happy Times replaced by
worries for his relatives and friends
when he hears hears from them he says
communication is bad and often breaks
down it really hurts me when I call
someone and I don't find them someone
tells me they died or disappeared their
corbs isn't there they are either under
the ruins or they're Torn to
Pieces Ahmed received his medical degree
in Bosnia and heroina it's nice in Saro
he tells us but he's grieving for
Gaza
my little family wife daughters all of
us are getting ready here I think the
atmosphere is better than it was 13
years ago when I was a student people
are talking about Ramadan we are
expecting the time ofar and people are
welcoming the month with kindness and so
are we they bring a peace of Gaza here
ahmed's daughter Leila makes paper
lanterns this is the way she evokes the
spirit of Ramadan

well spending Ramadan with my family far
from our home in Gaza is so difficult I
wish for peace to come I wish we can go
back even though our house is
destroyed moments of Joy family
gatherings and happiness are now only a
video memory he hopes to return home and
start over but right now he can only
remember his previous life with sadness
and pain Kim sepher Al jazer Saro
