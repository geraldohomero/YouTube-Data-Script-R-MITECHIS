Israel and Hamas's armed dispute
In the midst of increasingly intensifying
For the first time, support for Israel
A rally to appeal was held
In the back, claiming the Palestine Regiment
As the grandfather begins to stick, the debate
Yun Tae -in is heating
I'm a reporter, Israeli flag shape
Hundreds of people with pickets are Seoul
We gathered in Gwanghwamun, Israel
Let's ring the song that I think of my hometown
Recalling Hamas's terrorism among the participants

Last week, supporting Palestine
Citizens' Organizations in Korea
Let's hold a rally in front of the earth attack
I also urged to stop now
What is currently being threatened with this existence
Not Israel
Facing the Palestinian Rogue Retaliation
It is not Israel
Palestinians in college
Daejabo related to Israel and Hamas dispute
Afterwards, the pros and cons will heat up
It is supporting Palestine
College students say Israel through Daejabo
For decades of invasion of Palestine
I'm complaining of solidarity.
He said he would attack and attack the Gaza district
I have a Umpo, but now
Attacks and raids are fact
How ruthless it is
I expose things and again about it
Once the solidarity of Palestine
Some of the appeals are Hamas' terrorism.
Whether it is supporting
The reactions of students who saw Daejabo
It's mixed, when you see friends around you
Uh, too surface
Only the part is not being illuminated
I thought about it and some historical things
You have to take a look and evaluate it first
No nobody star
I'm murdering civilians
About to avoid criticism
I can't do it, so the large scale of Israel
Civilians while the ground forces are imminent
Depending on the tragedy of the damage, this dispute
Looking at the domestic public opinion movement will also be heated.
This is the view
