We are on this famous place of
hostages The country's nerve center HE
Where the Israeli population is
brings together to carry the cause of
hostages let us remember there are 138
Always captive in the Gaza Strip
always in the hands of Hamas and the
mobilization does not weaken thousands
people are expected
gathering this evening of
Gathering every Saturday evening
Since the start of the war and among
The present people here and well there
has hostage families who for
Some request the resignation of
Prime Minister Benyamin Netaniahou
because it must be said the discomfort is
growing and concern is
growing since the end of the truce
a lot of concern linked in particular to
the Israeli army offensive in
The Gaza Strip we saw it yesterday with
this failed army operation
Israeli who aimed to release
aoatage and which ended in two
soldiers seriously injured and then the
death of a hostage he is information
that we had a little earlier and who
was confirmed this afternoon by
the Israeli army so here is a lot
of concern also linked to the stories which
emerge the accounts of the hostages that have
been released on the conditions of
captivity of stories in particular abuse
Sexual so there are obviously a lot of
fear among loved ones and therefore it is
The object of this gathering this evening
It is to be heard to be done
hear by Israeli authorities
to recall to put the front of
the scene that it must be the priority of
release all the hostages and that the most
quickly possible and then the idea too
it is to come together for the
population to show their support for
families here is the mines are
serious there is still one one
friendly atmosphere with concerts
shows many people who
wear this yellow ribbon in color in
tribute to the hostages here it is the
also need to be together and
reunite uh that we can observe uh at
gathering of this evening
