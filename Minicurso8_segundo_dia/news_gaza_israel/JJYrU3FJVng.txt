And on the Palestinian side they are again
In exchange three times more than
prisoners who were just released
After midnight 33 ex -detainees of women
young people under 19
details our special envoy to
Jerusalem Karim
Yayaoui must be expected in any case
Families are specifying to new
releases you mentioned the
Palestinian prisoners 33 were
released yesterday 30 minors once again
It is the most recurring profile and
Three women from GÃ©nine
One of Jerusalem is among minors
A 16 -year -old girl who was
incarcerated at the age of 14 for
acts of assassination attempt to
knife of facts which are refuted by
The girl uh and therefore today
You have to expect possibly to
new exchanges therefore ten
Israelis against around thirty
Palestinians a welcome truce also
In the Gaza Strip which can blow
and who can welcome the help yesterday
humanitarian aid This truce was made no
without difficulty with the pressure of the United States
and and Qatar you should know that this
was not necessarily won in the
measure where on the side of Hamas we wanted
a truce over several days and that
Israelis were ready to concede a
truce from day to day it is therefore
the hypothesis of truce days that has
been selected is liberations that
are happy moments but also
moments of concern for those who
remain and on the Israeli side we know that the
M plays the pressure card
psychological on the euh families because
What to play the card on pressure
psychological is playing the card on
Pressure pressure on Benjamin
Netaniaou who was uh who has
showed more and more will to
make the release of hostage a
priority he still met yesterday
hostage families uh there is a background of
several billion checks that have
been uh unlocked to come and come everything
help all the victims of the 7
october
