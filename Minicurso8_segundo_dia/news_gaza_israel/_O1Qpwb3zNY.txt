This week Michel Rabel Nurse of
doctors without borders finally reached
Mexico City after almost a month
working in the conflict zone in
Gaza in this war between Israel and the
Terrorist group ever this afternoon my
companion Daniel Jzo talked with her
told the horrors that had to
witness although it does not rule out to return to
This area to help the people
Palestine the 26 days were quite
frightening terrifying were days
full of bombing of many noises of
Many shouts of ambulances
There was no moments when there were 5
hours without stopping bombing
feeling that buildings are going
falling around you is terrible
quite fellow workers of the
health have lost their lives everyone are
Well, to the expectation of knowing if they are going to
Living or not had never lived anything
similar to this I have been in others
places and the truth is that it does not compare
At no time at some point already
The security of us was not
guaranteed was too much bombing
The killing was indiscriminate is for
that asked us to leave more without
However there are more than 200 people still
of doctors without borders working
Inside from home they are not heroes are
people delivered and dedicated that
They prefer to stay even though that
imply dying plan to return once
that the conflict is reduced or ends
Of course people in Gaza have received me
With open arms and I feel
that I owe you life and I hope soon
To be able to replace me with this and good to treat
to return a little of that humanity that
They have given me a high
It is necessary to help the fire
humanitarian is allowed and stop
kill
people need to stop
to return humanity to
people in
