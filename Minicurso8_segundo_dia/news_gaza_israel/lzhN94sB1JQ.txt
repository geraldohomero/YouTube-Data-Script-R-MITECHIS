Ton explosives on the front area and border
How much does it fall over the Israeli situation
He can be harmed that is why
Battle with Hizbullah expensive for Israel
May fall and he complete with Hizbollah
Capture Hamas before causing war
Would like to do it
Would like to counter infrastructure
Because two front war for Israel
Will become expensive now after Gaza
The number can be beless because the war that
Things are becoming clear from this, it is clear
That if Hizbullah stopped attacking Israel
If you do not do it, Israel was a ruin of wastage
The tornado will bring the roots of Hizbullah
Karr can lose his existence like a straw
Although Hizbullah compared to Hamas
Jung from is not so easy for Israel
Having
Wave
Hamas Hizbullah is in trouble in Khaja
Is not the result
Bear Number Hania after realizing Gaza
Will be Nasrullah before
The account will now rain in the unemployed
Waste tornado
There is a very old saying come, kill me i.e.
To invite the trouble by moving forward
The same thing is Leban's extremist organization Hizbullah
He is also doing when Israel is very angry
I have a fire of changing each child of Israel
Israel is burning in 1200 of all of them
Jewish
Cruelum
In lieu of the life of 50000 fighters of Hamas
For which Israel needs blood
Gave all your military strength
Israel's entire focus is in Gaza at this time
Hamas is uprooted but
Hamas's sympathy Hizbullah again and again
If you are attracting the attention of what
Is Hizbulla playing with fire
Hizbullah himself trying to burn his house
Will Israel be able to withstand the anger of Israel
Hizbullah actually Hamas Israel's War
Since then Hizbullah continuously on Israel
Is attacking and from Israel
Hizbullah at the same pace of every attack
Answer is being given but it is Israel
Israel is not an idea instead of a missile
This is the Israeli who fired 10 missiles
The identity is and the same attitude on the land of Arabia
Israel has been saved from uprooting his feet
But now it seems that Hizbullah
Close to crossing the extent of tolerance
Repayed
In such a situation, when is Hizbullah to that red line
Will cross and when is Israel's anger
Stuffed red eyes in a heap of gunpowder
It will not be said that it cannot be said of Israel
