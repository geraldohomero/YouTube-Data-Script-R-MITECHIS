Let's go from world at war the figure of
Netanyahu that we have left it too
those keys a little next to the figure of
Netan Yaho is key at this time
especially after what happened
Internally last weekend
last Saturday
Netyahu at a time of the end of
Week published a tweet that caused the
Complaint of much of the population of
Israel around remove all kinds
of guilt about what happened on 7
October of course the tweet does not
seek that they will not find it
He immediately erased and apologized
because he was putting himself in the focus of
one of a coalition government where
There is a unit of unity right now
national in which they were going to lengthen
But fast after what he said
what he said was that he blamed the bosses of
SAFETY OF THE GREATER PROBLEM LPSO
Israel security event in decades
Then as I tell you, he eliminated him and
apologized but the figure of Netanyahu

Saturday that leaves us leaves us the
key photography that Netanyahu has
had to ask for the first time
Sorry when focusing on the bosses
Safety error security
