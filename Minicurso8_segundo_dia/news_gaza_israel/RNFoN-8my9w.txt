Israel says it's lifting part of its 
blockade of Gaza - after a request  
by US President Joe Biden during his visit.
Tel Aviv said Wednesday that it won't stop aid  
entering Gaza from Egypt – and Egypt, says the US, 
has agreed to reopen its border crossing to let  
some aid flow into the enclave.
This was an air strike  
near that border on Wednesday.
Truckloads of aid and volunteer workers  
have been piling up on the Egyptian side for days 
- as the UN warns of a "humanitarian catastrophe." 
The fallout from a blast that hit 
a Gaza City hospital continues,  
drawing protests across the Arab world - 
some violent - and a debate over its cause. 
Hamas says hundreds of people were 
killed in the explosion - and that  
it was caused by an Israeli strike.
Israel has blamed a failed rocket  
launch by another faction: Islamic Jihad.
It's provided these drone images as evidence -  
claiming it’s not consistent with an air strike.
This was Biden in Israel: 
Based on the information we've seen today, it 
appears the result of errant rocket fired by a  
terrorist group in Gaza. The United States 
unequivocally stands for the protection  
of civilian life during conflict and I 
grieve - I truly grieve for the families  
who are killed or wounded by this tragedy.
The White House National Security Council  
echoed Biden in Washington -
saying the US assessment was  
based on analysis of overhead imagery, 
intercepts and open source information. 
The Israeli military is also accusing 
Hamas of inflating the number of dead. 
And it has released an audio conversation it 
claim is between two Hamas militants discussing  
a misfired rocket from Islamic Jihad.
Islamic Jihad has denied blame.
