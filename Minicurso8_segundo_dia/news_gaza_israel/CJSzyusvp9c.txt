CTV'S VANESSA LEE NOW ON THE
HORRORS OF THE HEAT.
>> Reporter: BRITAIN IS
BRACING FOR ITS HOTTEST DAY YET
WHICH THE COUNTRY IS DESCRIBING
AS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.
MOST HOMES, SCHOOLS AND SMALL
BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE AIR
CONDITIONING.
>> THIS WEATHER IS ABSOLUTELY
UNPRECEDENTED.
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THESE TEMPERATURES IN OUR MODELS
BEFORE.
>> Reporter: AUTHORITIES WARN
THE DANGEROUS HEAT COULD BE
DEADLY, EVEN AMONG THE HEALTHY.
AT LEAST THREE TEENAGERS HAVE
DROWNED WHILE TRYING TO COOL
OFF.
THE LATEST A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY.
THE HEATWAVE IS WREAKING HAVOC
ON TRAVEL.
FLIGHTS TEMPORARILY GROUNDED AT
THIS AIRPORT NORTH OF LONDON
AFTER RISING TEMPERATURES CAUSED
A DEFECT ON THE RUNWAY.
TRAIN SERVICE, TOO, IS BEING
DISRUPTED.
OPERATORS ARE ASKING PEOPLE NOT
TO TRAVEL, UNLESS ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY.
THERE ARE CONCERNS THE HEAT
COULD CAUSE THE TRACKS TO BUCKLE
OR KNOCK OUT POWER.
>> THAT'S GOING TO SLOW THINGS
DOWN.
>> Reporter: THE SCORCHING
HEAT IS BEARING DOWN ON ALL OF
WESTERN EUROPE.
ALREADY BLAMED FOR AT LEAST
1,000 DEATHS IN SPAIN AND
PORTUGAL, WHERE THEY SET A NEW
JULY HIGH OF 47ยบ.
THE FEROCIOUS TEMPERATURES
FUELING OUT OF CONTROL
WILDFIRES.
THIS SPANISH MAN WAS TRYING TO
PROTECT HIS TOWN WHEN FLAMES
ENGULFED HIS DIGGER FORCING HIM
TO RUN FOR HIS LIFE.
THERE WERE ALSO MOMENTS OF PANIC
ABOARD THIS TRAIN, AS PASSENGERS
GOT TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT.
>> JUST LIKE WHEN THE TRAIN WAS
RESUMING, I BEGAN SMELLING A
LITTLE BIT OF A SMOKE.
SO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY
SCARY IF WE HAD BEEN STAYING
THERE FOR MAYBE HALF A MINUTE
MORE.
>> Reporter: FOR PARTS OF
EUROPE, RELIEF CAN'T COME SOON
ENOUGH.
BRITAIN IS EXPECTING TO SET A
NEW RECORD TOMORROW WITH
TEMPERATURES FORECAST TO HIT
OVER 40ยบ
