Israeli hostages are now reuniting with their families today.
Part of the deal between Israel and Hamas
earlier today,
Hamas delayed handing over a second group of
hostages because of a dispute over aid for Gaza
and Palestinian prisoners. Reporter Rick Damla
explains how that delay got resolved.
There was a long delay Saturday over the
release of more hostages being held by Hamas.
Israel expected another 13 Israeli hostages to be released
but Hamas delayed the handover amid disputes over aid into
Gaza and the selection of Palestinian prisoners being released.
A
spokesman for the IDF says it takes time because there are so many moving parts.
It's a slow process, it will take time and we're all waiting for this to move ahead.
A
spokesperson for Qatar's Foreign Ministry says
the obstacles were overcome through mediation
between Israel and Hamas and aid is now en route to Gaza.
Meanwhile,
there was jubilation and relief as some of the hostages
being held by Hamas were set free on Friday.
Adriana. Adar
whose 85 year old grandmother was released.
Friday says it was bittersweet to see her.
It's a mixed feelings because we are also
concerned and worried about the other 211 people that are still being held hostage,
including my cousin,
among the others still being held include some Americans which
President Biden says he hopes will be freed soon.
We don't know when that will occur, but we're going to be expected to occur
and we don't know what the list of all the hostages are and when they'll be released.
But we know the numbers are going to be released.
The urgency for all hostages to be freed continues as
anxious family members wait for news of their loved ones.
It's a disaster. We just won't
to see her with us again to
hug her.
