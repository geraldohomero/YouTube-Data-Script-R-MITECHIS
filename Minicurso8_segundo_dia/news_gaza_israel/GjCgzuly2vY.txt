.
MR. SECRETARY, YOU SAID YOU
SPOKE WITH YOUR COUNTERPARTS.
CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF THE
RUSSIANS' REACTION TO THE CALL.
DID THEY SUGGEST TO YOU THEIR
DEFENCE THAT THIS WAS AN
ACCIDENT OR INTENTIONAL OR THAT
IT NEVER HAPPENED?
CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A BETTER
READ-OUT OF YOUR CALL.
AND GENERAL MILLEL, HAVE YOU
SPOKEN TO YOUR COUNTERPART, ARE
YOU INTENDING TO DO SO, AND ARE
DO YOU BELIEVE AFTER WHAT YOU'VE
SEEN THAT THIS WAS INTENTIONAL?
IS THIS CONSIDERED AN ACT OF
WAR?
>> THANKS FOR THE QUESTION.
I WON'T SPEAK FOR THE MINISTER
NOR WILL I GET INTO THE DETAILS
OF OUR DISCUSSION.
I'LL JUST REITERATE THAT THE
UNITED STATES WILL FLY AND
OPERATE WHEREVER INTERNATIONAL
LAW ALLOWS.
WE TAKE ANY POTENTIAL FOR
ESCALATION VERY SERIOUSLY, AND
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IT'S
IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE LINES OF
COMMUNICATION OPEN.
I THINK IT'S REALLY KEY THAT
WE'RE ABLE TO PICK UP THE PHONE
AND ENGAGE EACH OTHER, AND I
THINK THAT THAT WILL HELP TO
PREVENT MISCALCULATION GOING
FORWARD.
>> THANKS FOR THE QUESTION.
ON THE INTENTIONALITY, DON'T
KNOW.
I DO PLAN TO TALK TO MY
COUNTERPART.
WE HAVE A SCHEDULED CALL.
WE'LL SEE IF THAT WORKS OUT.
SO WAS IT INTENTIONAL OR NOT?
DON'T KNOW YET.
WE KNOW THE INTERCEPT WAS
INTENTIONAL.
WE KNOW THAT THE AGGRESSIVE
BEHAVIOUR WAS INTENTIONAL AND IT
WAS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND
UNSAFE.
THE ACTUAL CONTACT OF THE FIXED
WING RUSSIAN FIGHTER WITH OUR
UAV, PHYSICAL CONTACT OF THOSE
TWO, NOT SURE YET.
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
BUT I CAN'T -- I CAN TELL YOU
WITH CERTAINTY THAT WE HAVE
ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE OF THE CONTACT
AND THE INTERCEPTION AND IT'S
VERY AGGRESSIVE.
YOU HEARD ABOUT THE DUMPING OF
THE FUEL.
WE HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE OF ALL
THAT.
THERE'S NO QUESTION AT THAT PART
OF IT IS INTENTIONAL.
THE PHYSICAL CONTACT OF THE
AIRCRAFT, I'M NOT SO SURE.
WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT.
WE'RE NOT POSITIVE OF THAT YET.
AS FAR AS AN ACT OF WAR GOES,
I'M NOT GOING TO GO THERE.
INCIDENTS HAPPEN.
CLEARLY WE DO NOT SEEK ARMED
CONFLICT WITH RUSSIA.
I BELIEVE AT THIS POINT WE
SHOULD INVESTIGATE THIS INCIDENT
AND MOVE ON BUT WE WILL CONTINUE
TO EXERCISE OUR RIG
