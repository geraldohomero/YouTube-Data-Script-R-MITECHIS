Light Benamin Netah who was
actually entrusted for a long time yesterday
evening to the American channel ABC News the
Head of Israeli government laughs
First of all his refusal to mark a break
In the fighting there will be no
stop the general fire in Gaza without the
release of our hostages he also evokes
Possible suites
Listen according to President Biden CE
would be a mistake for Israel to occupy
Gaza who will have to govern Gaza at the end
of the
war those who no longer want Hamas
I believe that Israel for a period
indefinite will be responsible for
security because we have seen what is
passed in the opposite case when we
are not responsible for
security is the terror of Hamas that
is unleashed so
unimaginable here is Israel responsible for
Safety in the Gaza Strip after
war is the subject that all
world retains today it remains very
blur it remains very blurry it also stays
a little worrying because we see
that the Israeli Prime Minister who
is at war with Hamas so is
only in this logic
security that is to say that there we go
eradicate Hamas and then we go
resume from a security point of view
control of the Gaza Strip but
You can see that there is no
political perspective
resume negotiations with
Palestinians for a solution to two
States are we trying anyway
to improve things from a point of view
economic no all he says is
Israel alone can ensure the safety of
The Gaza Strip it starts from the principle that
Hamas will be completely eradicated uh this
which remains to be seen must be remembered that
2005 when Ariel Charon one of
predecessor of Mr. Netanyahu has
decided to dismantle the colonies of the
Gaza strip and completely remove
The Israelis of the Gaza Strip are
because he believed it was too much
complicated to manage from a point of view
security that it cost extremely
dear that there were clashes
permanent therefore you imagine after this
who is going there in this
Israel moment reinvest the gang of
Gaza
It's doable but it will be very very very
complicated with 2 million
Palestinians who have undergone what they have
suffered from Israel thank you very much
Bruno for decryption in any case
