[Music]
more hostage had been freed uh they
include the first US citizen to be freed
Abigail Idan uh it's a particularly
tragic story Abigail was orphaned in the
hamus massacres of October the 7th her
father uh tried to Shield her from
bullets and died uh her mother managed
to uh Usher two of her siblings into a
cupboard they survived and were rescued
but sadly her mother was killed as well
two days ago one of our fellow
Americans a little girl named Abigail
who turned four years old she spent her
birthday that birthday and at least 50
days before that held hostage by Hamas
today she's free and Jill and I together
with so many Americans are praying for
the fact that she is going to be all
right you know she's free and she's in
Israel now and uh so those who are now
uh wrapping Abigail in love and care and
the Supportive Services she needs she's
been through a terrible trauma she's now
safely in Israel and we continue to
press and expect for additional
Americans will be released as well and
we will not stop working till every
hostage is returned to their loved ones
that's my goal that's our goal to keep
this pause going Beyond tomorrow so that
we can continue to see more hostages
come out and surge more humanitarian
relief into into those in who in need in
[Applause]
Gaza
[Music]
after initial assessment the returning
hostages arrived at the Air Force Base
and from there they moved on to the
hospitals where their families and loved
ones wait for them this is a very moving
day but we do not forget for one minute
all the other hostages who are being
held captive for 51 days now by the
murderous organization
Hamas
we've also uh been given an idea this
evening of the toll taken on hostages
including Emily hand the little Irish
girl taken hostage by Hamas yesterday we
finally got Emily back from the hands of
the gazan
[Music]
terrorists

weight um from her face and
body uh but generally doing better than
we expected
um uh we we're still fighting and want R
Ro him Ya's
sister he's mother we want her back as
they promised they wouldn't release
children without their mothers but they
did and we're in the
hospital saish
