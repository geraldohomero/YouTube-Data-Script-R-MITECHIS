 
OR WHATEVER IS GOING ON ON THE 
FRONT LAWN THERE.  
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>>  NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDERWAY 
FOR A THREE DAY HUMANITARIAN 
CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA.  
THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS.  
THAT WOULD ALLOW MORE AID TO 
GET IN AND ABOUT A DOZEN 
HOSTAGES TO GET OUT.  
WE HAVE MORE FROM THE BORDER 
CROSSING WHERE TRUCKS ARE BEING 
INSPECTED. 
>>  GOOD MORNING.  
THIS IS A FIRSTHAND LOOK AT THE 
HIGH SECURITY INSPECTION 
PROCESS OF THE AID TRUCKS GOING 
IN THE GAZA.  
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING INSIDE 
THESE BOXES AND WE HAVE BEEN 
SEEING ANYTHING FROM FOOD TO 
BISCUITS TO DETERGENT AND 
TOOTHPASTE.  
THE GOAL HERE, THE MISSION, THE 
PRIORITY, IS THAT EVERYTHING 
GOING INTO GAZA MUST BE 
INSPECTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
FOOD AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES DO GO 
IN AND GET TO THE CIVILIAN END 
OF THE PALESTINIANS AND TO MAKE 
SURE WEAPONS AND FUEL DO NOT 
GET INTO THE HANDS OF HAMAS. 
>>  REPORTS OF A CEASE-FIRE FOR 
UP TO THREE DAYS WOULD LET 
TRUCKS LIKE THESE IN AND LET 
GAZANS FLEE THE POUNDING BY 
ISRAEL'S MILITARY IN THE NORTH. 
THAT AREA IS NOW LIKE A 
DEMOLITION SITE, A WASTELAND 
FROM THE WAR.  
THE UNITED NATIONS SAID 50,000 
PALESTINIANS FLED NORTHERN GAZA 
YESTERDAY.  
THE DAY BEFORE THAT, IT WAS 
15,000 AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT, 
5000.  
WE ARE SEEING A SURGE IN 
EVACUEES.  
MANY LEAVING WITH JUST THE 
CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK AND IN 
ANY WAY THEY CAN.  
WHAT IS GOING AND IS JUST A 
FRACTION OF WHAT IS NEEDED.  
THERE ARE SHORTAGES AND FIGHTS 
OVER FOOD, WATER, FUEL, MEDICAL 
SUPPLIES. 
THE W.H.O. 
IS WARNING OF AN OUTBREAK OF 
DISEASE. 
>>  AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS 
IN GAZA WILL CONTINUE UNLESS 
AND UNTIL THE
