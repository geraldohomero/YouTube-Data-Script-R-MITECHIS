Southern gaza, since they say
They have less resources than the
North and the routes to arrive
There have been destroyed by
The bombings.
Jorge: Thank you, Vilma.NOW
We will talk about the Israelis, already
They don't want to continue living like this,
They don't want to be waiting for a
Bomb at that time, an act
Terrorist, they don't want me to
Kidnap your children, this is not
It is normal, but it has
Converted normality into
Israel, this for them
Justifies the war that is
Doing, this morning we had
The opportunity to travel through
Road from Tel Aviv, to
The south, to As ┘┘ Ashkelon, and
Suddenly on the road
Missiles appeared in the sky
From Hamas, this was what we saw.
Way to Ashkelon, in the south of
Israel, in border with Gaza,
We find dozens of
Missiles launched by Hamas, the
Anti -aircraft defense system
Israel known as the dome
Of iron destroyed almost all,
But some fell on land.
Today is a day of many missiles
Who are falling in Ashkelon,
As we see in the background there is smoke
 Of one of the explosions and
A military operation of
Israeli army, this is the
Day that many in Israel
They were fearing, and
Unfortunately it is
Happening.
In the Ashkelon hospital we
We find the doctor
Claudio Cristal, a
Argentine anesthesiologist, but
Shortly after the start of the
Interview sounded the alarm by
The arrival of other rockets of
Hamas.
This is the new normality in
A country at war, but for
No one is easy.
>> Cowgirls part
To which last Saturday
They kidnapped two of their children.
>> The people of
Beds, they made a massacre,
From Kabuts many people are missing.
Jorge: I hope to see it very soon
WITH HIS KIDS.
 There is no major despair for
A father who does not know where
There are your children, or worse, if
THEY ARE ALIVE.
I'M SO SORRY.
