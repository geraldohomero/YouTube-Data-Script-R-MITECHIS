OTHERS TAKEN HOSTAGE OR STILL
MISSING.
IN OUR TIME HERE IN ISRAEL,
EVERYWHERE WE HAVE GONE, WE MET
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED IN
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BY HAMAS'S
BLOODY HAND.
A LOVED ONE, A FRIEND, A
CLASSMATE, A NEIGHBOR, A
COLLEAGUE KILLED, MAIMED,
MISSING.
WE ENCOUNTERED A NATION KNIT
TOGETHER BY GRIEF BUT ALSO A
NATION UNITED IN RESOLVE.
THE UNITED STATES SHARES THAT
RESOLVE.
WE STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL.
FROM HERE, I WILL GO ON TO
JORDAN WHERE I WILL MEET WITH
KING ABDULLAH AND WITH
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY PRESIDENT
ABBAS.
I WILL VISIT WITH LEADERS IN
SAUDI ARABIA, THE UNITED ARAB
EMIRATES, EGYPT AND QATAR.
ACROSS EACH OF THESE
ENGAGEMENTS, WE WILL CONTINUE
PRESSING COUNTRIES TO HELP
PREVENT THE CONFLICT FROM
SPREADING AND TO USE THEIR
LEVERAGE WITH HAMAS TO
IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
RELEASE THE HOSTAGES.
WE WILL DISCUSS HOW WE CAN
CONTINUE TO MAKE REAL OUR
AFFIRMATIVE ISSUE FOR A REGION
THAT'S MORE PEACEFUL, MORE
PROSPEROUS, MORE SECURE, MORE
INTEGRATED.
IN FACT, THAT IS THE CHOICE.
THE CHOICE IN SOME WAYS HAS BEEN
MADE EVEN MORE STARK BY THE
ACTIONS OF HAMAS ON SATURDAY.
ONE PATH FORWARD IS A REGION
THAT COMES TOGETHER, INTEGRATED,
NORMALIZED RELATIONS AMONG ITS
COUNTRIES, PEOPLE WORKING IN
COMMON PURPOSE, COMMON BENEFIT.
MORE PEACEFUL, MORE STABLE.
THEN THERE'S THE PATH THAT HAMAS
HAS SHOWN IN ITS STARK, CLEAR
LIGHT.
TERROR, DESTRUCTION, ANILISM.
THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE
CLEAR.
WE KNOW THE CHOICE THAT WE ARE
MAKING, OUR PARTNERS ARE MAKING.
WE HAVE WORK TO DO TO CARRY IT
THROUGH.
IN ALL I DID TODAY, I WAS
SUPPORTED BY AN EXCEPTIONAL TEAM
IN ISRAEL.
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING CRUCIAL
WORK IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS,
LED BY STEPHANIE HALLOT.
SHE'S DOING AN EXTRAORDINARY
JOB.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WELCOMING OUR
FUTURE AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL.
AS MANY HERE KNOW, HAMAS
LAUNCHED THIS ATTACK ON THE DAY
LAUNCHED THIS ATTACK ON THE DAY
THAT JEWS CELEBRATE FINISHING
THE READING OF THE TORAH.
THEY WILL READ IN THE BEGINNING
THERE WAS DARKNESS.
AND THEN THERE WAS LIGHT.
THE FIRST PERSON WAS ALONE UNTIL
A PARTNER JOINED THEM.
I'M STANDING HERE TODAY
ALONGSIDE OUR ISRAELI FRIENDS
AND ALL THOSE WHO REJECT TERROR
TO HELP FIND THE GLIMMERS OF
LIGHT, EVEN IN THIS MOMENT OF
DEEP DARKNESS, AND TO MAKE CLEAR
