STRIKE TEAMS HAVE MOVED ACROSS
STRIKE TEAMS HAVE MOVED ACROSS
THE LINE TO SEARCH FOR HOSTAGES
WE ARE TOLD AS WELL AS CLEAR
THE AREA OF HAMAS GUNMEN.
ONE WAS KILLED AND THREE OTHERS
INJURED.
SOME OF THE TROOPS AND SOME OF
THE EQUIPMENT ON THE BORDER HAS
BEEN REPOSITIONED AS WELL.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
SITUATION FOR CIVILIANS.
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO MOVE
SITUATION FOR CIVILIANS.
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO MOVE
AGAIN OR RISK BEING SEEN.
AGAIN OR RISK BEING SEEN.
OF COURSE, IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE.
THERE IS NO PLACE TO GO, AND
THERE IS FEAR THEY WON'T GET TO
GO BACK HOME.
>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
THOUSANDS HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS
WHO CAN'T MAKE THE TRIP.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY WAY TO GET
THERE.
THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO STAY.
EVEN THOSE WHO ARE LEASING --
LEAVING AND HEADING THAT WAY.
THAT IS A VERY REAL CONCERN.
EVEN MORE SO, WHAT IS GOING TO
BE WHAT WHEN ALL OF THIS IS
SAID AND DONE.
WE KNOW THERE IS ALREADY
EXTENSIVE DAMAGE FROM THE

INTO GAZA, IT IS ONLY GOING TO
GET WORSE.

UPDATED ON THEIR ESTIMATION OF
HOSTAGES.
222 NOW THE NUMBERS BEING HELD

TWO ISRAELIS BEING RELEASED,
THEY HAVE BEEN OUT THERE FOR
TWO DAYS NOT ONLY ISRAEL BUT
THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT HAS
SAID PROOF IS IN THE ACTION,
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE
HOSTAGES BEING MADE READY FOR
TRANSPORT.
THEY SAY THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE
OFFER AT THIS POINT.
THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS
STALLING BY HAMAS, THAT THEY ARE
USING THE FACT THAT THEY ARE
HOLDING THESE HOSTAGES TO TRY
AND PUT OFF THE GROUND ASSAULT.
THAT IS SOMETHING WE WILL HAVE
