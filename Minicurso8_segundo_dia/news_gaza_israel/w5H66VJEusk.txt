as the Israel's war with Hamas enters
fourth day we've been tracking all the
developments right here on beond while
the world leaders remain divided over
the conflict the Arab League has reacted
strongly to Israel's war with Hamas and
the incessant barrage of air strikes by
the Israeli forces across the Gaza
Strip Secretary General Ahmed Abul gate
traveled to Moscow to talk about gaza's
current situation and reiterated an
urgent need for action on the two states
ution this as the Kremlin has targeted
us warning of yet another Nation
entering a state of full-blown War
TI
f
the foreign Ministers of the 22 Nation
Arab League will be holding an emergency
meeting on Wednesday to discuss ways
that and I'm quoting here stop Israeli
aggression reports revealed that this
meeting was called in response to
Palestinian authorities
request meanwhile Iranian president
Ibraham REI said that Iran supported the
Palestinians right to self-defense and
warned that Israel must be held
accountable for endangering the region
meanwhile Western Nations have reacted
strongly in favor of Israel UK has
called our Nations supporting the Hamas
to withdraw their
support right so on Middle
East many of you will have seen what's
happened over the past 36 hours in
Israel and the scenes are truly truly
horrifying and as I said yesterday like
this is not a time for
equivocation we should just be
straightforward in what's happening here
and that's the Hamas and the people that
support Hamas are fully responsible for
appalling appalling acts of terrorism we
should call it out for what it
is citizens of Israel are being
murdered well that's not all us has sent
a naval carrier strike group to Eastern
Mediterranean as one of Israel's
strongest allies us is the first nation
to deploy military backup as the war
shows no signs of dying down as we enter
the for day of the war in
Israel and taking a recap but during the
third day of the war a long night awaits
and very little is being done to
immediately push for a
