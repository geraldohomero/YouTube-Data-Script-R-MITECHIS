on the road into ashalon as hamas's
deadline passed a furious barrage of
missiles launched by Israel's iron doome
defenses they contrails searing the
early evening
Sky intercepting the Rockets from G
it's half an hour now past the 5:00
deadline that Hamas had issued in their
ultimatum to the people of ascalon and
we've now seen a third barrage of
rockets coming in and irone missiles
going up to intercept them in the sky we
can see puffs of smoke where those
Rockets are intercepted it seems that
most of them um have been blocked
neutralized as they came in there are
some PS of smoke on the ground on the
skyline in ascalon in the city but it
seems that the threat that Hamas issued
to the people of ashalon has largely
been neutralized and is now it seems an
empty threat at least for
now we drove in to see what damage had
been
done at the scene of One impact another
alarm the mood here is jittery and
nervous several have been in injured in
these attacks said the Israelis some of
them seriously hurt here as Windows were
blown

in the rocket far didn't let up only
minutes later another barrage came
in
earlier we'd witnessed what Israel is
doing in return as we filmed across the
border multiple air strikes on the
densely populated areas of Northern
Gaza in Israel's border towns they want
more action seeking revenge and their
security restored this is the blood of a
guy who cut his hand out while trying to
clim in igal was at home when Hamas
arrived on his doorstep think security
cameras caught the chilling moments as
their Fighters broke in but couldn't get
further and you're all in your apartment
he was lucky but a gal feels abandoned
by his government where is the police
where is the Army we got so many bases
and so many soldiers but where did the
those guy vanish
to we feel
betrayed Israel is promising a whole new
kind of War mobilizing 300,000 so
solders mustering its armor but the
threat for now is not on the
ground above brush fars lit by the Hamas
attacks yet more missiles jeweling with
rockets life here is now under constant
threat from the
skies for millions of Israelis living
under this is for now the new
Norm as this conflict continues to
escalate
