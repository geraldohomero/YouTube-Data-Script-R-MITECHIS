The Supreme Israeli court declared void
A key law for judicial reform
raised by the Netanyahu government
The conservative prime minister intended
introduce substantial changes in the
legislation to cut the capacity
government control by
Judges these plans faced a
great popular opposition causing
Mass protests throughout the country the year
past the Gaza War since then
He had eclipsed the
question
We analyze the subject now with Luciano
Sakara in Doja Qatar Luciano what
This Court's decision means
Israeli for Netanyahu and his government
We could say that it is a hard blow
For the first
Minister is a hard blow because this
judicial reform plan was
presented since March of last year
of 2023 and had many
detractors even within their
own government and within the opposition
Like ben
And this marks that the
Supreme Court obviously does not accept
The interference of the Executive Power
About the ability of the court
constitutional to legislate and to
control the clear executive branch and
How is the future now
politician of the first
Good minister the political future ofu already
is quite complicated from the point
of view of what is happening now
With the current war in Gaza and already
I was previously complicated huh
Some attributed this attempt to
Modify the judiciary or limit
THE JUDICIAL POWER TO AVOID FUTURE
Hey corruption trials and on the other
type of causes against
From him when this will end this
add more firewood to the fire let's say and
further aggravates the political future of
Netanyahu because eh as well we are
Lately seeing the extension of the
Guerra makes more and more detractors
They exist within Israeli society
even within the cooking of government
Of course thank you Luciano Sara
