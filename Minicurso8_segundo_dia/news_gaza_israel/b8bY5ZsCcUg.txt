and now let's shift our focus to some
big political news coming from israel
it's netanyahu's former aid and
right-wing nationalist naftali bennett
who will now rule the roost in israel
let's move ahead to know a little bit
more about him and his political journey
born in the israeli city of haifa two
immigrants from san francisco
49 year old naftali bennett is a former
commando and a high-tech millionaire
one generation younger than 71 year old
prime minister benjamin netanyahu
bennett has had a long and often rocky
relationship with the former israeli pm
he worked with him between the years
2006 and 2008 as a senior aide
to netanyahu who was then opposition
leader
bennett reportedly left on bad terms so
later stormed into the national politics
stage in 2013
serving as defence minister as well as
minister of education and the economy
in various netanyahu-led governments
bennett has been an advocate of
liberalizing the economy
he has voiced support for cutting
government ready for businesses and
lowering living costs
by increasing competition orthodox
rabbis wield strong influence in israel
but bennett is comparatively liberal on
issues such as
gay rights and the relationship between
religion and state
but on the issue of palestine his views
are no different than netanyahu's
he has cited security reasons to say
that the creation of a palestinian state
would be suicide for israel
bennett has been a staunch supporter of
the jewish settlements in the occupied
territory
he is a former leader of yeshua which is
the main settler movement
in the occupied west bank bennett made
the annexation of parts of the west bank
a major feature of his political
platform
but now as the head of a government
including left-wing and centrist parties
while also relying on support in
parliament from arab legislators
it would be politically unfeasible to
follow through on annexation
