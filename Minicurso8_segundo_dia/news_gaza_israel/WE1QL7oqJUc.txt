O
CTV'S RICHARD MADAN IN
WASHINGTON.
THANKS, RICHARD.
>> Richard: YOU BET.
>> Heather: TO BREAKING NEWS
NOW.
GHISLAINE MAXWELL JEFFREY
EPSTEIN'S FORMER ASSOCIATE
HAS BEEN SENTENCE TODAY 20
YEARS IN PRISON.
IN DECEMBER A JURY CONVICTED
MAXWELL ON FIVE OF SIX
COUNTS AGAINST HER INCLUDING
SEX TRAFFICKING,
TRANSPORTING A MINOR TO
PARTICIPATE IN ILLEGAL SEX
ACTS AND TWO CONSPIRACY
CHARGES.
MAXWELL DENIED ABUSING
ANYONE.
HER LAWYERS HAD ASKED THE
JUDGE TO IMPOSE A SENTENCE
OF NO MORE THAN FIVE YEARS,
WHILE PROSECUTORS SAY SHE
DESERVED AT LEAST 30 YEARS
BEHIND BARS.
LET'S LISTEN IN NOW TO
REACTION FROM GHISLAINE
MAXWELL'S TEAM.
>> GHISLAINE MAXWELL SHOULD
NEVER HAVE BEEN DENIED BAIL.
SHE HAS ENTOWERED THE MOST
UNUSUAL AND SEVERE
CONDITIONS OF PRETRIAL
DETENTION IN SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT.
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PUBLIC
AT LARGE HAS LITTLE SYMPATHY
OR COMPASSION FOR INMATES.
THAT OF COURSE IS UNTIL THEY
THEMSELVES OR MEMBERS OF
THEIR FAMILIES HAVE BRUSHES
WITH THE LAW AND FIND
THEMSELVES IN THE MIDST AND
THRUST INTO THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM.
GHISLAINE'S TREATMENT FOR 22
MONTHS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT,
AND RECENTLY AGAIN, WAS
ABHORRENT.
THE CONDITIONS IN THE M.D.C.,
EVEN MENTIONED BY THE JUDGE,
ARE REPREHENSIBLE.
FOR THOSE OF YOU IN THE
PRESS, IF YOU NEED A STORY,
IF YOU WANT A STORY, THERE
IS YOUR LEAD.
I HAD URGE YOU TO RUN WITH
IT.
GHISLAINE MAXWELL IS A TRULY
EXTRAORDINARY PERSON.
SHE HAS BEEN SENTENCED TO AN
EXTREMELY LONG TERM OF
IMPRISONMENT FOR A
60-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, WHO HAS
SHOWN NO INVOLVEMENT
WHATSOEVER IN CRIMINAL
ACTIVITY FOR THE BETTER PART
OF THE PAST 20 YEARS OR
ANYTHING BEFORE THE CONDUCT
OF CONVICTION.
>> Heather: LISTENING IN TO
THE TEAM REPRESENTING
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,
DESCRIBING THE CONDITIONS
SHE HAS ENDURED IN PRISON
CALLING THEM REPREHENSIBLE.
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, JEFFR
