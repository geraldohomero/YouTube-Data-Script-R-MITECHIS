DEPARTMENT MEMO REPORTEDLY SLAMS
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S POLICY ON THE 
ISRAEL/HAMAS WAR URGING HIM TO 
REASSESS HIS SUPPORT FOR THE 
JEWISH STATE.
RICH EDSON HAS MORE FROM THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT.
>> GOOD MORNING, MIKE.
100 STATE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES 
SIGNED ONTO THIS MEMO PUSHING 
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO 
DEMAND A CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA.

TAKEN A LOOK AT THIS MEMO HERE 
REPORT SAYING QUOTE MEMBERS OF 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND NATIONAL

DISREGARD FOR THE LIVES OF 
PALESTINIANS, DOCUMENTED

OF THE STRENGTHS OF THIS 
GOVERNMENT.
>> NOW THIS AXIOS REPORT SAYS A 
JUNIOR DIPLOMAT ORGANIZED THE 
CABLE.
THE SAME PERSON POSTED ON SOCIAL
MEDIA THAT BIDEN WAS BEING
