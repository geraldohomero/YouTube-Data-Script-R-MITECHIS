ONES AT HOME.
SUZANNE SOMERS DATA 76.
>> THE ISRAELI DEFENSE SOURCES
GATHERING TANKS AND RESOURCES.
FOR MORE ON THIS WE WILL BRING
IN RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL
KEITH KELLOGG A FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR.
GENERAL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.
I WANT TO GET YOUR SENSE OF SOME
REPORTING.
THE IRANIANS HAVE WORN ISRAEL
THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS THAT
IF THERE IS ANY GROUND OFFENSIVE
IN GAZA THAT THERE WILL BE A
RESPONSE TO THAT.
HOW SHOULD ISRAEL RESPOND TO
THAT?
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
I THINK IT IS A VERY SERIOUS
THREAT.
THIS IS WHERE THE UNITED STATES
CAN WEIGH IN AS WELL.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE.
THAT IS WHY THE BATTLE GROUP IS
THERE.
THAT IS THE REASON HE HAS AN
HIGHER GROUP IS GOING THERE AS
WELL.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE
MISSILES.
BASIC LOAD OF THE MISSILES
AROUND FIVE-600.
1000-POUND WARHEAD.
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO
THERE WHEN YOU DO IT.
HAMAS STARTED THIS FIGHT.
LETTING THE ISRAELIS FINISH THE
FIGHT TO THE BEST DEGREE.
TRYING TO DO SO.
WHAT THE ISRAELIS WILL DO, IF
THEY DO GO INTO A GROUND RESULT,
THE WORST IS IN AN URBAN AREA.
SLOWER TO AFFORD THE PISTOL
RANGE WHEN YOU ARE DOING THE
SHOOTING.
IT'S A HARD THING TO DO.
STAND BACK AND ISOLATE.
THE REASON WHY THINK IT IS ALSO
IMPORTANT IS TO HOLD THE FORCES
IN FOR A LOT OF THEM.
THEY CAN HAVE IT THEREFORE
SUSTAINED CALLING AN AUDIBLE AND
GO TO THE NORTH AS WELL.
>> THAT IS A MAJOR RISK.
>> IT IS MUCH MORE CAPABLE FORCE
THAN HAMAS IS SPIRIT FACING THE
TWO FIGHTS OUT THERE.
THE UNITED STATES COVERING THEIR
BACKSIDE.
TELLING IRAN TO BACK OFF.
THEY KIND OF PROVED IT.
GETTING BAD VICES.
YOU PUNCH THEM IN THE NOSE REAL
HARD AND THEY STAND BACK SAYING
MAYBE THIS WAS NOT SUCH A GOOD
IDEA.
THAT IS WHAT OUR PRESIDENT NEEDS
TO TELL THEM RIGHT NOW.
DON'T YOU GET INVOLVED.
GIVE THEM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY
NEED.
IT'S NOT REALLY A MILITARY FIGHT
IT IS A POLITICAL FIGHT.
DIPLOMATIC FIGHT IN AN ECONOMIC
FIGHT AS WELL.
THIS ADMINISTRATION GAVE
AUTHORITY OVER $250 MILLION.
WE TOOK THAT ALL THE WAY IN THE
LAST ADMINISTRATION.
ENERGY SUPPORT TO IRAN.
YOU CANNOT NORMALIZE RELATIONS
WITH A TERRORIST STATE.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT ISRAEL CAN
DESTROY HAMAS?
THAT IS A PRETTY DEEP GOAL.
>> COMMITTED TO IT.
THEY WIN IN 2014.
THEY WENT IN FOR A MONTH.
ACCOMPLISHING THEIR OBJECTIVES.
THEY NEED TO GO FULL BORE.
TAKING ONE OF THE BUILDING
STRUCTURES.
