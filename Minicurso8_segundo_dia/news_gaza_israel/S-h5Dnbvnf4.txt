We are entering the fourth month of the fighting and what
We have so far let's see it in the eyes of
The olives like you said The band is divided into two
The parts that everyone knows the northern part is ruined
A million civilians who have left their homes have been destroyed
Down south In the language of the Middle East, it seems
The foundation of a definite, unequivocal victory
In the south it's a different story that Rob has Population
Gaza has gone down there and Israel probably doesn’t want to go
Right now until the end of a Northern-style military operation
Such a thing as the beer collapse The border from Egypt and the movement
There are people who say it’s based on demand
And some people say it's not
Possible what Here is the problem with both models and you
This is what we want to say tonight until Israel is a target
In the northern Gaza Strip, olives are already leaking a pen Pen
Back to her madness and the Russian language at the center
Gaza terrorists wearing civilian clothes return to the warehouse
The weapons prepared for this situation for the day before
Under the guise of coming back to life, they resume terrorist attacks
From fiery kings and I pass on a king for the purpose of injury
In every soft shadow of a house destroyed by a house Here is the market
It looks busy on Friday and it is still busy today
And rest as if there was no war in the face
The descriptions that tell us On the northern Gaza Strip
150 people don't think so
It is estimated that in the northern Gaza Strip who who wants
A win must be made around this market
Beyond the citizens
That there are active fairyers or hiding places
And hidden apartments that can take out Weapons
To the tools of the IDF that behave relatively there
Without interference, it is a shame for Israel to lose its most achievement
important in his war And right now the Gazans are rodents
We will move to the south until Israel decides
Here again, the IDF wants to move on to a model of raids
And not for war As massive as a victory in the north
In this format it is hard to get clearly seen
Janine Wall Cream takes time but first All
Remember the smuggling pot anyway
From there, humanitarian aid is actually given
Now oxygen pipes for our only enemy We'll mention it
Hamas is the enemy and we have been promised to destroy it
At the end of the operation
