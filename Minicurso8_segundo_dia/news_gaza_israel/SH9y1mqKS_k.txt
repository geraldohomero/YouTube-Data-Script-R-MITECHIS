this was an emergency meeting to discuss
the situation in east jerusalem the
meeting was requested by
nearly two-thirds of the 15-member
council including france and it's yet
another sign
that the international community is
concerned about the violence in
jerusalem but the council did not
release a statement
at least not yet china which holds the
rotating presidency said that the
council
should act swiftly to urge de-escalation
of tensions and to reaffirm its
commitment to a two-state solution
well the u.s reportedly told diplomats
that public comments from the council at
this time would be counterproductive
although there is reportedly a draft
statement in the works now whilst the
trump administration had been supportive
of israel at the u.n no matter what
and had used its veto power in the
security council to protect israel from
any criticism
that's not necessarily going to be the
case for the biden administration biden
has promised to stand by israel at the
u.n but this latest
violence in jerusalem is really going to
test that resolve
now the u.s has called on all sides to
de-escalate and calm the situation the
u.s is reportedly
trying to mediate behind the scenes
talking with both sides
french ambassador to the u.n nicolas de
riviere told the council that france is
gravely concerned by the rise in
violence and he said
that france calls on all actors to show
utmost restraint
u.n secretary general antony gutierrez
has expressed his deep concern
over the continuing violence in occupied
east jerusalem he urged israel to cease
demolitions and evictions
in line with its obligations under
international law and human rights law
he also called for restraint so really
that's what we're hearing from the
international community
calls for restraint and calls for
de-escalation
