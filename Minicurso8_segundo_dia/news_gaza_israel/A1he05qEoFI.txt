just a warning that throughout her
report are images that you may find
distressing over the top that's what Joe
Biden calls this Israel's devastating
response to the October the 7th
attacks but Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed
to keep
going in De Al Bala in the center of the
strip nine dead after an Israeli air
strike do not inure yourself to these
pictures even though there have been so
many and will be more to
come the little children overwhelmed
with
fear the collective trauma the sheer
scale of
loss 28,000 dead gaza's Health Ministry
says another hundred
overnight in Rafa in the South near
Egypt a Prelude of what is to come air
strikes on what Israel says says are
Hamas Targets in their last stronghold
in
Gaza five of those killed here from the
same family three of them
children ardel was hit but I don't think
he was a Target he is not part of the
resistance he's an ordinary person he
has a three-year-old son could he really
be part of the
resistance there are more than 1 million
people in Rafa now most displaced from
elsewhere is has announced that it will
work on a dual plan to evacuate
civilians even as the IDF tries to
eliminate the four Hamas battalions that
they say are based here but Aid agencies
warn of an impending Calamity now they
have nowhere else to go they cannot they
cannot move they have already been on
the Run uh uh uh they have been through
multiple rounds of displacement from the
north to the middle area to kanun to
Rafa and uh there's nowhere left there's
no more south in Gaza STP than ra
and there in amongst the tents in that
last remaining patch of shelter there is
only
despair I want to stay here and I won't
leave here whatever Israel wants to do
let it be done I'm staying in my
tent in Jerusalem this Friday a small
group of protesters outside the knesset
calling for elections the return of the
hostages and for Netanyahu to go the
charge here is that Netanyahu Allied as
he is with the extremist far right
is only making things worse exacerbating
the worst crisis in Israel's history but
if Netanyahu is not even listening to
the United States why would he listen to
these
people a ceasefire ordeal seemingly dead
in the water this week and the fate of
so many the Israeli hostages and
thousands of Palestinian civilians still
desperately
