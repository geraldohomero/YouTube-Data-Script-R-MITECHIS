No person can leave today
to pray to your God if you have it from
solidarity with the relatives of the
dead and injured to demand
immediate release from
kidnapped nobody can deny the
Right to the legitimate defense of the people
and the state of
Israel just ask that let's not let the
Terrorists fans or
anti -Semites and make you forget
Who are one of the most
important in the history of
Humanity The only democracy of the East
Next one of the most capable countries
brave and mestizos of the world I am the
admiration of those who have heart
To admire we admire you for your
ability to live in the middle of
danger of prospering and innovating to know
be up to everything
your ancestors suffered you are a
Brother people for Spain and we are with
You as Spanish and representative
From the Madrid I bring you our
condolences our love and support as
Woman I feel fright and never
They will erase true
images I know you will be up to
The terrible time that touches you
go over more than 2000 years still
Out of your land you were still
The same people the Jewish people and nothing
Nor will anyone change you anyone can
deny your right to be and exist to
The promised land that is your home
And the home of many who are not Jews
But your democracy welcomes anyone
can believe yourself oblivious to terrorism to
any type of your miserable plan of
end freedom and
Prosperity in the world terror
wants to kill all the good we have
built throughout history
They are able to make us forget our
own humanity but I repeat that I do not
The enthusiasm will achieve conviction
The bravery and imagination of the people
From Israel will make this work last
admirable that
you are
