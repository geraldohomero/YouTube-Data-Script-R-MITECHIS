after four days of deadly violence
between the palestinians and the
israelis
u.s president joe biden is sticking with
his calls
for both sides to hold their fire the
question
is how
how we get to a point where they get to
a point where
there is a significant reduction
in the attacks particularly
the rocket attacks that are
indiscriminately
fired into population centers the biden
administration had not
made the israeli-palestinian matter a
top foreign policy concern
mainly because of the covet 19 pandemic
and the resulting economic slowdown
analysts say that was a mistake the team
is not fully staffed up
on the middle east it's it's adopted
this posture that i think
affected badly the obama administration
as well which is this reactive
tactical crisis management posture the
white house is being criticized
for blocking an emergency security
council meeting on the issue
but it has sent a state department
official to tel aviv
to urge israeli and palestinian
officials to declare a ceasefire
a point underscored thursday by the u.s
secretary of state
tony blanken but we are deeply concerned
with the
loss of life among civilians
especially among among children
palestinians have a right to live
in in security and to live in peace just
as israelis do and so we are working
hard to
encourage all sides to stand down
meanwhile in congress strong bipartisan
support for israel but from democrats
a show of support too for palestinians
caught in the fighting
there's a respect for meeting the needs
of the palestinians
but there is a palestinian power
struggle and this is about hamas
so i wouldn't just label it palestinian
i would say hamas
and hamas is
threatening the security of people in
israel israel has
a right to defend itself from
republicans
accusations the u.s has indirectly
endangered israelis
by trying to pursue a new nuclear deal
with hamas's primary supporter
iran it's difficult to believe an
american president would consider
removing terrorism
or missile related sanctions at the very
moment
iranian rockets are raining down on
israel a sign of
how challenging it will be for the biden
administration
to manage this sensitive part of its
foreign policy
