Rua asked donors on Wednesday
that suspended financing
support support to help
Relieve a humanitarian crisis in the
strip of
Gaza are about 380 million dollars
Those we need to continue now
We can settle for February to
pay the salaries of our
workers and the rest of our
staff including those of Gaza
We should be fine for March but not
We are totally sure of what
It will happen beyond that from
April
The impact will be very very large and
probably devastating in many cases
If the UNA does not obtain financing
that allows the agency to continue
providing services to refugees from
Palestine are some of the most
Poor in these Syria Lebano Cis countries
Jordan including Eastern Jerusalem and
Jordan is also a region in crisis
so not to have more increase

essential for the civilian population of Gaza

find other sources of funds with the

suspension of help from
countries
donors we continue doing work of
promotion in those countries that have
suspended the

lifeguard and we also work with
other private foundations or sectors of
other countries that have not suspended their
support and other nations that have not been
UNAA donors to take them
