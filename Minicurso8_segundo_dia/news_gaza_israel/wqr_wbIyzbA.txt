And we now have to account for one of
The latest EH attacks that had as
protagonist the Israeli army with the
death of six Palestinians and also
a sergeant who was part of the
Israel's army in the middle of
attacks that continue eh throughout
The Gaza Strip and that remain
during these days of January

less six Palestinians and this sergeant of
Israel's Border Police
They died during an operation of the
Army in Yen√≠n in S Jordan leaving
three other border agents injured

We differentiate S Jordan from what it is
also attacks and confrontation
that this incident is being given in Gaza
began with the explosion of an artifact
as of a vehicle in which
Sergeant Jaay Germai found
Only 19 years and three of his companions

Palestinian authority at a meeting

civilians for the ministry were

South Yenin at the time of attack
From the Israel army it is assured
that the six deceased were terrorists
and that they were throwing artifacts
Explosives against troops according to a
official message posted in one of the
Official Army Accounts in
parallel to the war against ever in
Gaza Israel as we said weeks
also intensifying their operations
In Sis Jordan that is the other place of
Conflict between Israelis and Palestinians
following the tendency that already began the
last year and has now left more than
250 Palestinians dead in the last 12
months in operations that Israel
justifies as an effort to eliminate
presence of militias in Sis Jordan
while the Palestinian authority
Describe as an act of extermination
promoted by the ultra -right that is
ruling Israel of the total dead
