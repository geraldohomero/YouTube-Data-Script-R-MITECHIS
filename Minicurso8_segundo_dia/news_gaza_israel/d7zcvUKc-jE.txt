H..
Everybody heard
You're daddy's.
His is fine
Hell never saw anything like this
Been in two In my life and never
See anything like this is
All for the sl
I care if you are A man or woman old
Man the killers the mers what did never
Can be
Forgiven
And bouncing off the nightmare
This one Forget all this
Happened all was so amazing the best party
That I was in my life until it was heaven to hell
Simple
Not a second
- One
And living and living has already begun
And everyone was afraid on the floor no one was Understood
What's going on? Girls started screaming
And people didn't realize where they were going
And everyone thought it was normal Color
It will be red and as if to wait but
All the sky was red, all the 300 400 hales
In the moment of the whole sky At first we thought it was even
Fireworks nobody understood
There was a party. There was no such thing as two people
Motorcycles on the road with Kalashnikov that started
Spray us while we're driving
I drove through Snow on, like, 180 190 Stomach
We're all down with bullets whistling at you
The windows were open because with shooters in the window
Don't blow us on The face
And just started full of already wide fingers
They couldn't get past 14 more
Bikers compared to the two that were Molino
And they started spraying everything cars in the back already
Left behind
And we went in. We didn't care about anything, and we started a warrant
Because Someone can help us
And no one helped
To us
And we looked for some dimension and we hid there and all
The time That's when we're already coming in on the side
Right we didn't make that face we waited for
50 terrorists are already inside the base And we did
Turn left at this time you hear gunshots
People are being wiped out
People screaming died at the same time in all kinds of ways
Places Inside the base are people who change people
Hiding inside the rooms we just walked in
I was sure we were being kidnapped
I wrote to my parents I figured out that my friend would say
To my parents I couldn't stand
And stay
- Whatever
Okay. Okay
