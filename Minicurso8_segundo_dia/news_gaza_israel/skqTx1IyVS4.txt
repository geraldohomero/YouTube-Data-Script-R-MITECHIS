Hi I'm Mike Pompeo.
I'm speaking to you from
beautiful Jerusalem
looking out over the old city.
I have a big job as Susan's husband and Nick's dad.
Susan and Nick are more safe and their freedoms more secure
because president Trump has put his America first vision into action.
It may not have made him popular in
every foreign capital but it's worked.
This president has led bold initiative
in nearly every corner of the world.
In China, he's pulled back the curtain
on the predatory aggression
of the chinese Communist party.
The president has held China accountable
for covering up the China virus
and allowing it to spread death and
economic destruction in America
and around the world.
And he will not rest until justice is done.
He has ensured that the chinese
Communist party spies
posing as diplomats in America
or jailed or sent back to China
and he has ended the ridiculously
unfair trade arrangement with China
that punched a hole in our
economy.
Those jobs? Those jobs are
coming back home.
And you'll recall too that when the
president took office
radical islamic terrorists had beheaded
americans
and isis controlled a territory
the size of Great Britain.
Today, today because of the president's
determination and leadership
the isis caliphate is wiped out,
it's gone.
It's evil leader, Abu Bakr Al-baghdadi,
is dead and our brave soldiers
they're on their way home.
The president too moved the US embassy
to this very city of god, Jerusalem,
the rightful capital of the jewish
homeland
and just two weeks ago, the president
brokered a historic peace deal
between Israel and the
United Arab Emirates.
This is the deal that our grandchildren
will read about in their history books.
