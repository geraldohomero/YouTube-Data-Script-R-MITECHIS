STUART: JIMMY FAILLA IS WITH US
AND USED TO BE A NEW YORK CITY
CAB DRIVER.
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU WERE
STUCK ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE?
>> FIRST A POINT OF CLARITY, A
LOT OF  PEOPLE ON THE BROOKLYN
BRIDGE ARE METS FANS THAT WANT
TO JUMPED MUCH.
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU COME ACROSS
IN NEW YORK CITY.
THERE'S TWO LEVELS OF
INDIFFERENCE HERE AND ONE IS THE
LEVEL OF PROTESTERS AND THE LACK
OF CONSIDERATION FOR THEIR
FELLOW HUMAN BEING, WHO MIGHT BE
IN A AMBULANCE, WHO MIGHT BE ON
THE WAY TO A MEDICAL EMERGENCY
OR HEAVEN FORBID LATE FOR WORK
FOR JOB INTERVIEW OR SOMETHING
OF CONSEQUENCE.
THEY'RE SHOWING THE LEVEL
OVENDURANCE THEY ARE TO THE
SUFFERING THEY CAUSE AND NUMBER
ONE IS NO WAY TO WIN PEOPLE TO
THEIR SIDE AND NUMBER TWO IS A
LARGER PROBLEM COMING TO THE
WHITE HOUSE.
THEY DON'T WANT TO SPEAK OUT AND
CONDEMN THIS BECAUSE THE PRO
HAMAS KAKAS IS A SIGNIFICANT P
ER -- CAUCUS IS A PERCENTAGE OF
WHAT BIDEN NEEDS TO WIN M
ICHIGAN.
HE CAN CONDEMN GAZA AND THE P
ROTESTS AND NOT SIGNING
ANYTHING THAT WOULD FEDERALIZE
THE LAW TO BLOCK HIGHWAYS AND
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO.
BUT WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT IT, S
TU, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT IN THE
NAME OF PROGRESS BECAUSE THERE'S
NO PROGRESS THAT'S GOING TO BE
MADE THIS WAY.
IT'S MORE OF A HEY, LOOK AT ME.
THAT'S WHAT PROTESTING HAS
BECOME.
SOME ARE GETTING PAID.
OTHERS JUST SHOW UP TO PROTEST
LIKE FOLLOWING THE GREATFUL DEAD
AROUND THE COUNTRY.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE CLIMATE
CHANGE THIS WEEKEND.
WE'RE GOING TO DEFUND THE P
OLICE.
THAT'S THE WORLD WE'RE LIVING I
N.
STUART: GOT TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.
>> TERRIBLE.
I WOULD SUPPORT THE LAW BUT WHAT
I'D SUPPORT MORE WHOLE HEARTEDLY
IN THE SHORT TERM IS LETTING
POLICE DO THEIR JOB.
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO PEACEFULLY
ASSEMBLE.
YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO HOLD
ME HOSTAGE AND SHUT DOWN AN
AIRPORT.
STUART: I BELIEVE THE POLICE IN
SAN FRANCISCO ARE CHARGING THE
PEOPLE THEY ARRESTED ON THE G
OLDEN DETAIL BRIDGE. 
CHARGED THEM WITH IMPRISONING
PEOPLE IN THEIR CARS AND
ENDANGERING IN SOME KIND OF
CONSPIRACY TO SHUT DOWN THE
COUNTRY.
IT'S SERIOUS STUFF.
>> THIS SHOULD END AND WE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO O'HARE AND
MISS OUR FLIGH
