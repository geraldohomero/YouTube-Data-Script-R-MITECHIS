America's support for Ukraine's and
Israel's militaries has turned up the
heat on the US defense
industry factories across the country
tasked to build more weapons and
ammunition at a pace not seen in decades
but analysts warned the defense industry
is not keeping Pace with complex
threats ranging from Russian aggression
in Eastern
Europe to attacks from ironback
militants in the Red Sea
the Navy is firing more tomahawks in one
week than that service purchased all of
last year combined this is the kind of
peacetime production rates that need to
be turned around through the National
Security Supplemental a senate pass bill
with billions of more military support
for Ukraine Israel Taiwan and the United
States $50 billion of this request would
flow through our industrial base this is
as much about uh our national security
and and our industrial based capacity as
anything else but Ukraine matters not
only for Europe it matters for the
entire
world a world where China is watching to
see how the US and its
allies respond to the heat Beijing can
count they know how many missiles we're
buying or producing per year and it's
certainly not enough to deter or prevent
a war from happening in Asia
China has threatened to take control of
Taiwan by force if necessary a move that
would emit shock waves across the entire
Pacific region both Democrats and
Republicans in the Senate this week
urging the house to vote on the
supplemental and I certainly share the
chair's hope that this supplemental will
be enacted and signed into law very very
soon the bill funds more American
submarines that could help Patrol the
Pacific with a chunk of it covering the
Army's ongoing operations in
Europe Carla bab vaa news the
