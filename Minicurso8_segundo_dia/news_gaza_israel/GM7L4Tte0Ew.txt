When silent bombs are l4 nator
of a city in ruins after 11
days of attacks the reconstruction of the
hit gaza strip could carry
years or even decades a few hours
After high the fire scenes
shocking in the city of Gaza
They need years for reconstruction and
decades and the blockade should not rise
stop the destruction cycle and

US plans to be in front of the
Gaza reconstruction and appealed to a
Solution for the future
There is no change in my commitment
With the security of Israel Punto no
CAM at all
But I will tell you what there is a change
The change is that we have history
We need the solution of two states
The only answer is the only answer
It is the reconstruction of Gaza is seen
committed by the fact that
majority of western governments
They consider Hamas ruler in the
Strip as a terrorist group
