OUT.
STUART A TERRIBLE STORY.
GREG PALKOT, THANKS VERY MUCH.
72-YEAR-OLD ADINA MOSHE WAS
FREED ON FRIDAY.
HAMAS BROKE IN, KILLED HER
HUSBAND IN FRONT OF HER AND TOOK
HER PRISONER.
HER NEPHEW JOINS ME NOW.
TELL US, PLEASE, HOW YOUR AUNT
WAS TREATED.
>> MY AUNT A WAS TREATED IN THE
WORST THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE.
FIRST OF ALL, IT STARTED WHEN
THEY KIDNAPPED HER AFTER
BLASTING THE WINDOW OF HER SAFE
ROOM AND PULL HER OUT BAREFOOT
AND PUT HER ON A MOTORCYCLE TO
GAZA, AND THIS IS AFTER SHE SAW
HER HUSBAND, MY IF UNCLE -- MY
UNCLE, MURDERED.
FROM THERE WE LEARNED FROM HER
AFTER HER RETURN THAT THEY TOOK
HER BARE FEET IN THE TUNNELS,
THE HAMAS MURDER TUNNELS, WITH
REPUBLICAN IMPOSSIBLE TO
BREATHE, HIGH HUMIDITY, AND IT
TOOK THEM FIVE FLOORS BEE
NEITHER THE GROUND.
AND -- BENEATH THE GROUND, AND
THIS IS AFTER SHE I SAW ALL THE
MOB AROUND HER CHEERING CAN AND
LAUGHING FOR HER CAPTIVITY.
STUART: I JUST WANT TO ASK --
>> AND THEY --
STUART: LET ME ASK YOU THIS: DO
YOU WANT TO SEE A CEASEFIRE
EXTENDED AT RISK OF ALLOWING
HAMAS TO REARM?
>> THE ANSWER IS WE ARE NOT --
WE ARE THE FAMILIES OF THE
HOSTAGES.
WE WOULD LIKE ALL THE HOSTAGES
TO GET FREE.
AND WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO
TELL OUR -- HOW TO ACT.
BUT WE KNOW ONE THING.
WITHOUT THE MILITARY FORCES,
THERE WILL BE NO DEAL.
AND MY AUNT WOULD NEVER HAVE
BEEN RELEASED FROM THE CRUEL
CAPTIVITY -- CAPTIVITY SHE WAS
IN.
AND, YOU KNOW,.
[INAUDIBLE]
WITHOUT LIFE, ONLY TWO HOURS OF
LIGHT A DAY.
THEY ALLOWED THEM TO EAT LITTLE
RICE, LITTLE FOOD, AND THEY
COULD NOT EVEN TAKE A SHOWER FOR
SEVEN WEEKS.
THEY WERE SITTING ON CHAIRS, THE
CHILDREN WAS SLEEPING UNDER THE
CHAIRS.
THIS IS THE CONDITIONS THEY HELD
THEM IN.
AND THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD BE
RELEASED IS WITH MILITARY
ACTION.
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT SHE COULD
BE RELEASED WITHOUT THAT.
STUART: OKAY.
>> SO I BELIEVE THIS IS THE WAY
TO PROCEED, BUT I'M NOT IN THE
POSITION TO TELL THE GOVERNMENT
WHAT TO DO.
STUART: WE WANT TO GIVE OUR
VIEWERS AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOSTAGE AS
AND HOW THEY WERE TREATED, AND
YOU'VE HELPED US DO THAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
WITH US.
IT'S A TERRIBLE ST
