already what has not ceased in the last
time has been the criticism of Israel
From much of the political arc of the
European Union has manifested or more
no less than the head of the diplomacy of
the Josep Borrel European Union and said
that Gaza has become in the last
time an open cemetery as well
He cataloged him yesterday the
Chief of the
Diplomacy of the 27 Josep block
Borrel before a meeting of the
Foreign Ministers of the
Union
European Gaza was before the war the
Greater prison is open, he says
Borrel and adds and clarifies now is the
Greater cemetery to Ciel The open is a
cemetery for tens of thousands of
people but also for many of the
more important principles of
Humanitarian legislation This is the
sad
situation that is being lived in gauze
This is what Borrel asserts and puts this
also forms his speech aligned with him
that have been holding several leaders
of the European Union in recent times
around how worrying the
situation there in the Gaza Strip in
Your vision also seems that it is
unacceptable that the ambruna is used
as a gun and also prevent
the entry of trucks loaded with
Humanitarian aid the ministers of
Foreign Relations of the Union
European who gathered yesterday huh
also discuss catastrophic
humanitarian situation there in Gaza as
part of the agenda is included
proposal that has the support of Ireland
and Spain and that asks for the suspension of
Union Cooperation Agreement
European and Israel initiative that
I hardly achieve the unanimous vote of
The European Union block countries
As long as prepares a sanctions package
that would include Israeli settlers
violent that attack Palestinians in the
SIS Jordan Region United States and
The United Kingdom finally already
adopted sanctions on those settlers
extremists and this sanctions package
would also affect the
sexual violence during attacks in
Israeli territory that occurred last 7
of
October
