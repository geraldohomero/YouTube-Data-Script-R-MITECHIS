in Gaza we are no longer on the brink of
famin we are in a state of famine
affecting thousand of
people Chancellor schz told prime
minister
Netanyahu we cannot stand by and watch
Palestinian
star
okay then what are we going to do we
cannot stand by and watch Palestinian
staff what are we going to
do because this is this famine is not a
natural
disaster it's not a fla it's not a
earthquake is entirely
man-made by
whom let's there to say it by
whom are the one that prevents
humanitarian support entering into Gaza
by the lack of
access by the acute in insecurity inside
Gaza insecurity in itself
prevents uh distribution of support of
help but the problem is that hundreds of
TR trucks are waiting in the border and
the ones who control the Border prevent
them from coming
into I'm coming from Washington and I I
dare to say well yes is Isel is
provoking famine we send
parachutes in a place that is 1 hour by
car from the next
airport why don't stand it by aort
because they don't
let it is
unacceptable starvation is used as a
weapon of War yes the starvation is used
as a weapon of
War let's let's say that and it's not a
question of lack of sufficiency supplies
we hear that there are several months of
foot stuck on the Egyptian side several
months of foot
stock and even more than in many other
conflicts children are suffering most in
Gaza because they have nowhere to go
nowhere to hide so I would like
encourage you to encourage the call for
action for children affected by the war
in Gaza this is a war of Childrens more
childrens has been killed killed in Gaza
on this month that in the whole world in
the last four years but uh stop with the
Coco tears we have to take action in
