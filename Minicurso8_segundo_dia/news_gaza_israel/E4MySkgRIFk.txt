And now speaking of the war in the
Gaza Strip We have to make ourselves dry
of the meeting that held the
German president Olaf Schz with Net
ahu who asked Olaf Schz for him
to Netanyahu a high fire in this
War in the Gaza Strip
German president urged his pair Israeli
for the entry of more humanitarian aid
To the strip the chancellor met in
Jerusalem with Israeli prime minister
Benjamín Tahu who then asked
Let more humanitarian aid enter into
Gaza and also questioned the high number
Civil dead after more than 5 months
war there in Gaza we can't say
Olaf Schz staying with crossed arms and
See Como Palestinians run the risk
to die of hunger that is not what
We represent together said Schs to
Netanyahu in the president's office
Israelí after qualifying as legitimate the
Israel's purpose to eliminate ever
for another possible October 7 that is the
date on which he never invaded and attacked
Israel but the harder the war
greater is the number of civil victims and
more desperate becomes the situation
of the people in Gaza said Olaf Schz more
The question arises, it doesn't matter how
important is the objective can
justify such terribly
high and there are other ways or there are no other
ways in what he questioned No Olaf Schz
whom we see on the screen in your
Meeting with Netanyahu finally
German chancellor also asked for
asked Netanyahu greater flexibility
To achieve an agreement that releases the
134 reeen that are believed to continue in hands
ever many possibly dead and
He said understanding the suffering of
relatives that every weekend
They protest the liberation of their beings
Dear for his part Netanyahu pointed out
that launching an operation in Rafá is not
something we will do to the population
trapped there said textual this said it
at the joint press conference with
Schz in Jerusalem and added that no
will accept any peace agreement that
weakens or prevents Israel from
defend hostile neighbors if
They offer an agreement a path to the
peace that weakens Israel and prevents him
defending that would make peace back
It is what the press said after the
Meeting with Olaf
Schz
Ah
