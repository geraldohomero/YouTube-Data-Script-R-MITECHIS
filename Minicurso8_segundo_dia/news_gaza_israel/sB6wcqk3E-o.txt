BLINKEN, AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT
HE IS MAKING A STATEMENT.
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.
>> THE ATTACKS CONDUCTED BY
MILITIA AT OUR PERSONNEL, BOTH
IN IRAQ AS WELL AS IN SYRIA.
JOB NUMBER ONE FOR ME IS TO
ENSURE THE SECURITY OF OUR
PEOPLE.
I HAVE AN UPDATE ON EVERYTHING
WE'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT
OUR PERSONNEL ARE SAFE AND
SECURE.
IN ADDITION, I HAD A GOOD
PRODUCTIVE, CANDID MEETING WITH
PRIME MINISTER --
THERE WERE REALLY TWO AREAS OF
FOCUS FOR ME IN THAT MEETING.
THE FIRST WAS TO REAFFIRM OUR
COMMITMENT TO OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH IRAQ.
WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS
PROGRESS WITH THE ROCK IN
RECENT YEARS, PARTICULARLY
WORKING WITH THE IRAQI
GOVERNMENT ON EVERYTHING FROM
ECONOMIC REFORM, TO ENERGY
INDEPENDENT, STEALTHY AND
STRENGTHEN ITS INSTITUTIONS,
BUILDING RESPECT FOR HUMAN
RIGHTS.
THREE NOT ONLY THE SECURITY
ASPECTS OF RELATIONSHIP, ALL OF
THESE DIFFERENT ASPECTS.
WE CALL IT 360 DEGREES, AND
WE'RE COMMITTED TO IT.
SO WE DID A, WE HAD A
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT, AND THE
PROGRESS WE'VE MADE.
SAME TIME, IT WAS VERY
IMPORTANT TO SEND A VERY CLEAR
MESSAGE TO ANYONE WHO MIGHT
SEEK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A
CONFLICT IN GAZA TO THREATEN
OUR PERSONNEL HERE, OR ANYWHERE
IN THE REGION.
DON'T DO IT.
I MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THE
ATTACKS, THE THREATS COMING
FROM MILITIA THAT ARE ALIGNED
WITH IRAN ARE TOTALLY
UNACCEPTABLE, AND WE WILL TAKE
EVERY NECESSARY STEP TO PROTECT
OUR PEOPLE.
WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR CONFLICT
FROM IRAN, WE'VE MADE THAT
CLEAR.
WE WILL DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO
PROTECT OUR PERSONNEL, BE THEIR
MILITARY OR CIVILIAN.
PRIME MINISTER ALSO DONIE HAS
BEEN VERY CLEAR, HIS
CONDEMNATION OF THE TALKS A
DIRECTED OUR PEOPLE, AND HIS
DETERMINATION TO DO IS
NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
SO, WE HAVE A GOOD, AS I SAID,
CANDID, IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.
MORE BROADLY, WE'RE WORKING
VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
CONFLICT IN GAZA DOES NOT
ESCALATE, DOES NOT SPREAD TO
