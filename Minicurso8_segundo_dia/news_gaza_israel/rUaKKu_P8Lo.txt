for simple
reason I've my great secretary of state
here he's been here for a lot I wanted
the person to come
that terrorist group Hamas has
slaughtered has been pointed
out and is not hyperb Su just
slaughtered
slaughtered and uh including 31 americ
part of
them including
children from Hamas were thinking it's
beyond my comprehension be able to
imagine what
they're committed evils that and
atrocities that uh make Isis look
somewhat more
rational
agre with you really
are and Americans are worried Americans
are worried because we know there's a
this is not an easy field to navigate
what you have to
do
but
respond continue to ensure that you have
what you need to defend yourselves
and we have to also bear in
mind all the Palestinian
people and it has brought them only
suffering write something for man said
uh he wrote a line that uh I think is
appropriate he said uh it's not we lead
uh not just uh well I won't go into it
I'll wait to later taking too much time
but the point is this that uh um I was
deeply saddened and outraged by the uh
explosion at the hospital in
GOI and based on what I've seen it
appears as though it was done by the
other team not not you but there's a lot
of people out there not sure so we got a
lot we got to overcome a lot of things
and also means encouraging life
saving to help the
pal and uh well anyway that's that's who
we are not just me but I me that's who
the United States is and
uh it's just not the example our power
it's the power example it's almost as
important the world's looking we uh
Israel has a value set like the United
States does and other democracies and
uh thank you for having me and uh I'm
looking forward to having a thorough
discussion about where everybody goes
from here but
thank
is their courage their
their bravery
is I'm proud to be
