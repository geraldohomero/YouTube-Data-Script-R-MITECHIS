This question can be given because one
Player gave his best in World Cup
And then dedicated it to Gaza Strip
Yes, which country is this player and
See what is its name
[music]
Mohammad Rizwan against Sri Lanka
Great century played due to his century
Pakistan chased record runs
But after this Mohammad Rizwan
Tweeted and debate started actually
Mohammad Rizwan in his tweet
Referred to the fight with and
Pakistani supported Gaza Strip
Wicket keeper batsman Rizwan wrote that it
Was for our brothers and sisters in Gaza
Happy to contribute to victory, it is easy
The entire team to make and especially Abdullah
Shafiq and Hasan Ali get great
Hyderabad for reception and constant support
I am very grateful to the people
According to the rules, the ICC tournament
Between any player any politics
Or not allowed to give religious statement
Would have been but Rizwan tweeted
Gave political statement and towards ICC
Nothing has been done on this matter yet
But questions are being raised there
Politics is also happening when socialist
Rizwan's leader from party leader Abu Azmi
Listen to the question about the tweet
What did he say Mohammad Rizwan who
Pakistani cricketer is Pakistan tomorrow
Tweet now after winning the match
Why you guys are Israel's Israel
Very worried brother you in Palestine
Does humans not look
Actually the battle of Israel and Hamas to the world
Western country is divided with Israel
Standing there, the middle East and Asia
Some countries raising voice for Palestine
Are but in most cases players
Stay away from such political cases
This is the reason why Rizwan's statement opposed
Is happening
And look ahead, the top of this time
