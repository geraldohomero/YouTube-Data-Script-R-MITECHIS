So what seems quite clear tonight
is that the center of gravity of
violence and well moves to
Gaza Strip The Army responded to
rockets pulled a little earlier in
leading a series of strikes on
the offender
And this is only the beginning that is what
said the staff a commander of Hamas
was killed and Palestinian sources
make lots of civilian victims then
Earlier in the day we heard
These siren will sound Jerusalem it is
extremely rare it had not happened
Since 2014
this request in total were drawn
on the city but it's more than sixty
five rockets that have been fired on
Israel
During this day Benyamin
Netanyahu who is still a first
minister until a government
be trained said that Israel
would also answer he also
warned the Israeli citizens they
said this conflict is indeed could
last long then throughout the
day we talked with sources
sources policies within the State
major
And it is true that there was a will
of the government finally today
to seek a way to appease
tensions in Jerusalem so as not to
precisely that the flameless situation at
gas one there were threats from the chiefs of the
Hamas but also Islamic jihad is
These last days tonight it seems
not we will take the path and that
Recalls the 2014 scenario somewhat
When all parties said
want to avoid climbing and
Finally the war in Gaza had
started she had lasted a month and a half
So it may last
the army in any case is quite clear on
the fact that operations are not going
limit yourself to this evening the southern Israel has
been declared in an emergency
schools will be closed tomorrow and it is necessary
very clearly expect a
military operation and which last
minus days Hamas goes
obviously answer this is what
is called a gear that's what we have
seen for example in 2014 but in any case
The Israeli army is very clear for
Hamas has crossed a red line in
Pulling rockets on Jerusalem and
The army intends to answer and not
Simply answer it simply
This evening
