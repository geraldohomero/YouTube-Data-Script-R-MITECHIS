October 7 was a black day when Hamas
The fighters themselves with the new battle with Israel
Hamas was given to Hamas entering Israel
The fighters gave crossed all limits
In Israel with the help of The paragliders
Hamas terrorists entered many Israeli women
Children taken hostage
Hamas with those held hostage
Terrorists crossed all the boundaries of barbarity
Had given bullets on common people
Nova music in rockets fired kips remud
Piles of dead bodies on seeing the festival
Started but during this time an Israeli soldier
Save the lives of many people by playing on their lives
Hamas fighters were raining hand granate
And this is an Israeli military rock of Hamas
Stand in front of fighters
He went to seven hand granate on Hamas
Threw back but the eighth grenade
Energy burst in his hand and her life lost
This Israeli military of duty named Sepo
The grandmother of the Ener Shape, Mima Ben Mehm
Told that he bravely in front of fighters
As soon as the voice of missiles stood up
Started and Alam played and Energi his friend
Hersh Goldberg and other 30 people hid it
People wanted to get out of the festival but
Hamas fighters were attacking so much that
He had to hide his and many more
Find a safe place for people and
Hidden there but Hamas's fighters
As soon as they find out the hiding of their place
They started attacking Hamas

Standed up and seven times a befitting reply to Hamas
