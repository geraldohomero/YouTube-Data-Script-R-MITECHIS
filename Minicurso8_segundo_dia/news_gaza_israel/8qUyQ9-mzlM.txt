We come talking about the war that happens
In the Middle East but we have to talk
of the countercara of what happens in
Iran where the
regular forces of that country to
try to improve what has to do
with their military capacity for
that comes and shown these images
announcing that they are carrying out
a combined exercise between
different elements of their forces
armed to improve their capacities
military not only to carry
a war action in case of
be necessary for example against Israel
or as a reaction to the eventual
Attacks that the United States and itself
Israel can carry out within
its territory but also for
coordinate what has to do with
different actions the different
operations that consequently have
to carry out and that's why they have
carried out this military exercise
almost large -scale could be said

that feeling because most of the
countries come out yes of course
Cecilio in fact we have also seen the
margin of showing your power or warning
what can happen accordingly
movements that are in fact a threat
for example the aircrafts that are

United States and what do they seek to give it
sustenance of what discursively does not
only Joe Biden says the president
of that country but also different
Pentagon officials and even
even of the Congress that they are going to
provide support to Israel in time
and in the amount that is necessary to
defend their vital interests and
So suddenly this type of
movements like those we see in
images seek to rigor what
discursively it is said from the sphere
Quiet politics when
You want
