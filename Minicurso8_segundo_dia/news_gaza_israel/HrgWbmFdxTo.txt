>> Todd: A GROUP OF HARVARD
STUDENTS NOW ASKING FOR
DEPOSITIONS TO SUPPORT THEIR
MENTAL HEALTH AFTER BEING
BLACKLISTED FOR SIGNING A LETTER
BLAMING ISRAEL FOR THE HAMAS
TERROR ATTACKS.
>> Carley: YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT.
ASKING FOR DONATIONS SAYING
THESE STUDENT HAVE BEEN
SUBJECTED TO RELENTLESS BULLYING
AND INTIMIDATION THEY MAY
REQUIRE LEGAL COUNSEL,
HEALTHCARE, MENTAL HEALTH
SUPPORT FINANCIAL AID OR
MENTORSHIP TO NAVIGATE THESE
TURBULENT AND UNCERTAIN TIMES.
OUTKICK HOST TOMI LAHREN JOINS
US NOW.
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE PAYING
FOR THESE STUDENTS' FINANCIAL
AID.
>> NOT ONLY DO I THINK WE SHOULD
NOT BE PAYING FOR TUITION ORE
SHOULD NOT BE PAYING FOR MENTAL
HEALTH THAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT
UPON THEMSELVES.
WHEN I SAW THAT HEADLINE I
THOUGHT IT HAD TO BE FROM THE
BABYLON BEE A PARODY.
NO IT'S REAL LIFE.
2023 AND WE LIVE IN THE UPSIDE
DOWN.
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THE JEWISH
STUDENTS ON YOUR CAMPUS FELT
WHEN THEY SAW YOU ADVOCATING FOR
HAMAS, A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION?
WHEN THEY SAW YOU DOWN PLAYING
THE ATROCITIES THAT HAPPENED IN
ISRAEL TO THEIR PEOPLE?
HOW DO YOU THINK THOSE STUDENTS
FELT?
IF THERE IS ANY STUDENTS ON
COLLEGE CAMPUSES RIGHT NOW THAT
NEED MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE OR
NEED COUNSELING OR ANY TYPE OF
SUPPORT, IT'S THE JEWISH
STUDENTS ON CAMPUS THAT HAVE
BEEN ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY
RAVAGED IN THE LAST WEEK BY
THEIR FELLOW CLASSMATES WHO HAVE
NO IDEA OR NO CONCEPT OF THE
HUMAN SUFFERING THAT'S OCCURRED
IN ISRAEL AND TO THE JEWISH
PEOPLE.
SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY TO
THESE STUDENTS WHO ARE SEEKING
DONATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE
NARCISSISTS AND QUITE FRANKLY
TONE DEAF AND REPULSIVE.
>> Todd: TOMI, I WISH WE HAD
MORE TIME.
TO ME THIS ALL COMES DOWN TO
CONSEQUENCES.
THESE KIDS GREW UP WITH NO
CONSEQUENCES FOR ANY OF THEIR
ACTIONS.
FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIFE THEY
FACE A CONSEQUENCE WHAT DO THEY
DO I WILL TAKE A WORD OUT OF
TOMI LAHREN'S MOUTH THEY PLA
