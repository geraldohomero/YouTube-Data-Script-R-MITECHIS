Little by little life returns to the bazaar of
softer after several weeks
closed in this Israeli city of 25000
Inhabitants almost all are Arab
Israelis of the surroundings used to go
there regularly prices are
Much cheaper the atmosphere is
colorful but the attacks ever
they've changed
[Music]
We all know some of those who are
Here but we continue
distrustful
We listen to language we speak
Around we are on guard no longer
we feel as free as before it is no longer
as before we are always afraid that
Someone come and do something before
There was so much

disturbing and very difficult it hurts in the
heart for both Arabs and
The Jews even if there is a guera
Jews too
These Arab merchants suffer are
Israelis of Palestinian origin
descendants of those who stayed in
their lands when the state of
Israel Israeli citizens but
Palestinians from heart none of them
Accept to talk to us in
Chamber when we leave the market
We find an Israeli businessman and
When we ask him what he thinks of the
Israeli operation in Gaza Strip this

Palestinians not ever were
civilians who worked in Israel and look
What they did how I can feel sorry
by
They go to the old town
But welcome is even less warm
that in the market our camera
Finally scares a person
Accept to answer us
What happened early October was
An error should not have happened is a
sin has nothing to do with the
religion or beliefs is an act
[Applause]
