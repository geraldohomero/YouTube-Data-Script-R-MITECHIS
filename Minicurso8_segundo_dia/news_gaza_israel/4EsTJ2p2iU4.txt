[Applause]
yeah so lots of booing
uh perhaps not a big surprise and what
does that mean
todd it's really hard to
understate the genuine emotional
outpouring
um that's been going on for this like
nearly for nearly a week now since the
death of justice ruth bader ginsburg
um american women millions of american
women looked at her
as a champion of their rights on
everything from reproductive freedoms to
equal pay to
workplace protections and they see those
now as
under siege by the republican white
house and the republican united states
senate
here that booing is a to me a perfectly
natural extension of the rage
of the sadness of the mourning that's
been going on um
in the country throughout the last you
know six five or six days
yeah people outraged that he would show
up some people saying
a lot of there's a lot of chutzpah yeah
yeah it's completely hypocritical given
his viewpoints
of of the late justice now what about
all the money before we go the democrats
have raised my understanding
uh john is that they've raised something
like 200 million dollars
since ruth bader ginsburg died by donors
who want to make sure that uh she is not
replaced prior to the election or
actually before a new president they
hope joe biden
takes office yeah let me just say one
thing that a lame duck appointment a
lame dunk confirmation would be
completely odious if they did that um
say if the republicans get bounced from
senate control
in november and then senators who are
not accountable to the voters
uh vote to confirm would be completely
would be completely odious
but yeah i mean todd my phone has been
lighting up for the last five days with
text pushes from democrats and
republicans alike
this has been a tremendous motivator for
people to give
money on both sides of the uh both sides
of the ledger
hey john good to see you again thanks
for this
