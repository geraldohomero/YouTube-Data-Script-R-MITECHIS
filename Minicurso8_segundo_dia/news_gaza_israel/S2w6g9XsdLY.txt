The Egyptian government is calling
massive protests tomorrow in what has
called the day of anger is expected
that these manifestations are attended to
length and width of the whole country while
We are still aware of when
humanitarian aid will enter into the
Gaza Strip after
Egyptian President of Fatah Al Sisi
will talk to Joe Biden by phone yesterday
night it was confirmed that the aid
humanitarian could go through Rafa and
Enter the Gaza Strip to relieve
The suffering of the Palestinians who do not
They have water practically food or
electricity for many days and
They urgently need what we do know
because this has been confirmed through
different news agencies is that
This morning would have entered machinery
To repair the road that would have
been affected by the bombings of
Israel against Rafa's passage in the
past week something that has prevented
vehicles could enter like them
We say we still have no confirmation
When the entrance of that
humanitarian aid but it is very important
that it is ever to occur as soon as possible because
The Palestinians tell us that
They practically have nothing to eat and
that drinking what was not discussed by
assumption was of the fuel something that
Israel eh considers that it will not enter or
that would not be part of that help
humanitarian that will enter the strip of
Gaza in the next few days because no
wants to be used by the group
Terrorist ever against the one who carries
fighting bombing endlessly tell us
that the Han Yunis area in particular in
The south of the Gaza Strip is being
bombarded today could have
produced at least about 12 dead in
an area in which many of
those refugees or many of those
displaced from the northern part of the
Gaza who has been the most affected in the
last days
