Mr High Commissioner for years the
united nation has ignored Palestinian
terrorism destruction hatred and
incitement for years it has disregarded
and ignored Israel's security concerns
for years it has ignored the hundreds of
Israelis murdered on our
streets neither in your report or
statement today did you mention the
Israelis killed by terrorist before and
after October 7th do they not matter
sitting behind me today are aiva seel
and RZ
benami for over 50 days these two
courageous women endured unspeakable
Horrors in Hamas captivity
as we speak their husband Keith and noad
are still languishing in
Gaza these Halls should have been a
symbol of Hope for Aviva and RZ and all
the
hostages that the world would act for
their human rights and their
release yet Unfortunately they have
become a mere footnote in the discourse
of this Council as reflected in the
statement just made by the High
Commissioner so you can continue to
speak in this chamber where the human
rights of Israelis and Jews mean nothing
meanwhile we will continue to do all we
can to bring our people
home

he say the world needs to end the world
needs to end when my father will be home
when all the other hostages will be home
and when we will be safe in our home
with no afraid of somebody body will
come in and just do what he wants
humanitarian Aid is is in Gaza from the
beginning taken by Hamas people we can
hear protests by people in Gaza that
they're saying please help us Hamas is
taking our food is taking our water the
problem in Gaza is Hamas is not Israel
the problem in the last 20 years is
Hamas
